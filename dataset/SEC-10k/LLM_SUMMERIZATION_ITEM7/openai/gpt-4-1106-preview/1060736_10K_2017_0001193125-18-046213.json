Our antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, technology utilizes the targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies to deliver cell-killing agents directly to cancer cells. We are commercializing ADCETRIS\u00ae, or brentuximab vedotin, for the treatment of several types of lymphomas. We are also advancing a pipeline of novel therapies for solid tumors and blood-related cancers designed to address unmet medical needs and improve treatment outcomes for patients.\nADCETRIS\u00ae (brentuximab vedotin)\nOur marketed product ADCETRIS\u00ae is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Commission for four indications, encompassing several settings for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma, for relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or sALCL, and for certain types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL. ADCETRIS is commercially available in 70 countries, including in the United States, Canada, members of the European Union and Japan. We are collaborating with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS on a global basis. Under this collaboration, Seattle Genetics has retained commercial rights for ADCETRIS in the United States and its territories and in Canada, and Takeda has commercial rights in the rest of the world. Beyond our current labeled indications, we have a broad development strategy for ADCETRIS evaluating its therapeutic potential in earlier lines of therapy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, mature T-cell lymphoma, or MTCL, also known as peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL, including sALCL. We are also evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor, or CPI. We and our partners are currently conducting these phase 3 clinical trials of ADCETRIS, all of which are described in more detail under the heading \u201c-ADCETRIS and Lead Product Candidate Development Pipeline\u201d in Part I Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> ECHELON-1: In collaboration with Takeda, we are investigating ADCETRIS plus AVD (adriamycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) versus ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) as frontline combination therapy in patients with previously untreated advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The ECHELON-1 trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that treatment with ADCETRIS plus AVD resulted in a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival. Interim analysis\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> of overall survival, the key secondary endpoint, also trended in favor of the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm. The FDA granted BTD to ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for the frontline treatment of patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. In December 2017, the FDA granted Priority Review for the supplemental Biologics License Application, or sBLA, we submitted in November 2017 seeking approval of ADCETRIS as part of a frontline combination chemotherapy regimen in patients with previously untreated advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date is May 1, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> ECHELON-2: In collaboration with Takeda, we are evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with CHP versus CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) for the treatment of newly-diagnosed MTCL patients.

We and Astellas are conducting a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with CPI therapy. We and Astellas also initiated a phase 1b trial of enfortumab vedotin in combination with CPI therapy for patients with first- or second-line locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.\nIn collaboration with Genmab A/S, or Genmab, we are developing tisotumab vedotin. We and Genmab plan to initiate a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer.\nWe have a collaboration with Unum Therapeutics, Inc., or Unum, to develop and commercialize novel antibody-coupled T-cell receptor, or ACTR, therapies incorporating our antibodies for the treatment of cancer.\nOur earlier-stage clinical pipeline includes other ADC programs consisting of ladiratuzumab vedotin, denintuzumab mafodotin, SGN-CD19B, SGN-CD123A, SGN-CD33A and SGN-CD352A, as well as immuno-oncology agents, SEA-CD40, which is based on our sugar-engineered antibody, or SEA, technology, and SGN-2FF, which is a novel small molecule. In addition, we have multiple preclinical and research-stage programs that employ our proprietary technologies, including SGN-CD48A.\nWe have collaborations for our ADC technology with a number of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd., or AbbVie; Bayer Pharma AG, or Bayer; Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., or Celldex; Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, or Genentech; GlaxoSmithKline LLC, or GSK; Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer; and PSMA Development Company LLC, a subsidiary of Progenics Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Progenics.\nRecent developments\nOn January 30, 2018, we entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Cascadian Therapeutics, Inc., or Cascadian, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company based in Seattle, Washington, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Cascadian for $10.00 per share net to the seller in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, which we estimate is approximately $614.1 million in the aggregate. Valley Acquisition Sub, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, has commenced the offer contemplated by the Merger Agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Cascadian common stock, or the Tender Offer, and as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Tender Offer, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, our wholly owned subsidiary will merge with and into Cascadian, or the Merger, and Cascadian will\nsurvive as our subsidiary. Our obligation to complete the Tender Offer and the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions. We refer to the Tender Offer and Merger together in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the Cascadian Acquisition. We expect to consummate the Cascadian Acquisition in first quarter of 2018. For additional details about the Cascadian Acquisition, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Proposed Acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics\u201d above.\nOn February 5, 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 13,269,230 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $52.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to us of approximately $690.0 million, before deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use the proceeds from the recently-completed public offering to fund a portion of the costs of the Cascadian Acquisition. In addition, as a result of the net proceeds to us from the public offering exceeding $400.0 million, the senior secured bridge loan facility various banks committed to provide to us on January 30, 2018 in connection with the Cascadian Acquisition is no longer available to us in accordance with the terms of the related commitment letter.\nOn February 8, 2018, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement and related platform technology license agreement with Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Pieris Pharmaceuticals AG, or together, Pieris, to develop novel bispecifics incorporating our antibodies and Pieris' proprietary Anticalin proteins for the treatment of cancer. For additional details about this agreement, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Corporate Collaborations\u201d above.\nOutlook\nOur ongoing research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities, together with the anticipated consummation of the Cascadian Acquisition and the anticipated integration and development activities related to the acquired Cascadian business and Cascadian's product candidates, including tucatinib, will require substantial amounts of capital and may not ultimately be successful. In addition, we may encounter unexpected difficulties during our anticipated integration and development activities related to the acquired Cascadian business and Cascadian's product candidates, any of which may cause us to expend greater funds and efforts or may slow, delay or limit development progress with respect to Cascadian's product candidates that we may acquire in the Cascadian Acquisition. Over the next several years, we expect that we will incur substantial expenses, primarily as a result of activities related to the commercialization of ADCETRIS, the continued development of ADCETRIS, enfortumab vedotin, and tisotumab vedotin, and, if the Cascadian Acquisition is completed, tucatinib. Our other product candidates are in relatively early stages of development. Enfortumab vedotin, tisotumab vedotin and our other product candidates will require significant further development, financial resources and personnel to pursue and obtain regulatory approval and develop into commercially viable products, if at all. Our commitment of resources to the continuing development, regulatory and commercialization activities for ADCETRIS, the research, continued development and manufacturing of our product candidates and expansion of our pipeline, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and the anticipated integration and development activities related to the acquired Cascadian business and Cascadian's product candidates will likely require us to raise substantial amounts of additional capital and our operating expenses may fluctuate as a result of such activities. We may also incur significant milestone payment obligations to certain of our licensors as our product candidates progress through clinical trials towards potential commercialization.\nIn addition, we may be unable to complete the Cascadian Acquisition. Even if completed, the success of the Cascadian Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our business with the business of Cascadian and to advance the development of Cascadian's product candidates. For additional details on these risks, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Cascadian Acquisition\u201d above.\nWe recognize revenue from ADCETRIS product sales in the United States and Canada. Our future ADCETRIS product sales are difficult to accurately predict from period to period. In this regard, our product sales have varied, and may continue to vary, significantly from period to period and may be affected by a variety of factors. Such factors include the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for ADCETRIS is available\nfrom government and other third-party payers, competition, the incidence rate of new patients in ADCETRIS' approved indications, customer ordering patterns, the overall level of demand for ADCETRIS, and the duration of therapy for patients receiving ADCETRIS. In particular:\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Obtaining and maintaining appropriate coverage and reimbursement for ADCETRIS is increasingly challenging due to, among other things, the attention being paid to healthcare cost containment and other austerity measures in the U.S. and worldwide, as well as increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to pharmaceutical drug pricing practices. We anticipate that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and an additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for ADCETRIS. We also anticipate that Congress, state legislatures, and third-party payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system, any of which could negatively affect our revenue or sales of ADCETRIS (or any future approved products).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> The competition ADCETRIS faces from competing therapies is intensifying, and we anticipate that we will continue to face increasing competition in the future as new companies enter our market and scientific developments surrounding biosimilars and other cancer therapies continue to accelerate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> We believe that the level of our current ADCETRIS sales in the United States has been attributable to the incidence flow of patients eligible for treatment with ADCETRIS, which can vary significantly from period to period. Moreover, we believe that the incidence rate in ADCETRIS' approved indications is relatively low, particularly when compared to many other oncology indications. In addition, we expect only modest sales growth in the near term as a result of the November 2017 FDA approval of ADCETRIS for the treatment of patients with primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or pcALCL, and CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides, or MF, who have received prior systemic therapy, subject to our ability to effectively commercialize ADCETRIS in this indication.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor these and other reasons, we expect that our ability to accelerate ADCETRIS sales growth, if at all, will depend primarily on our ability to continue to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use, particularly with respect to the frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and frontline MTCL indications. Our efforts to continue to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use will continue to require additional time and investment in clinical trials to complete and may not be successful. Our ability to successfully commercialize ADCETRIS and to continue to expand its labeled indications of use are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In particular, although we reported positive top line data in our ECHELON-1 trial in June 2017, there can be no assurance that either we or Takeda will ultimately obtain regulatory approvals of ADCETRIS in the ECHELON-1 treatment setting in our respective territories, which would limit our sales of, and the commercial potential of, ADCETRIS. Likewise, we may fail to commercialize ADCETRIS in pcALCL and CD30-expressing MF patients or in the ECHELON-1 treatment setting if our sBLA that we submitted in November 2017 is approved by the FDA, either of which would limit our sales of, and the commercial potential of ADCETRIS. In addition, negative or inconclusive results in our ECHELON-2 trial would negatively impact, or preclude altogether, our and Takeda's ability to obtain regulatory approvals in the frontline MTCL indication in our respective territories, which would also limit our sales of, and the commercial potential of, ADCETRIS.\nWe also expect that amounts earned from our collaboration agreements, including royalties, will continue to be an important source of our revenues and cash flows. These revenues will be impacted by future development funding and the achievement of development, clinical and commercial success by our collaborators under our existing collaboration and license agreements, including our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda, as well as by entering into potential new collaboration and license agreements. Our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and from quarter to quarter and, as a result, we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as being indicative of our future performance.\nFinancial summary\nTotal revenues increased 15% to $482.3 million in 2017, compared to $418.1 million in 2016. This increase was primarily driven by ADCETRIS net product sales that increased 16% to $307.6 million in 2017 as compared to $265.8 million in 2016, and by collaboration and license agreement revenues that increased 28% to $108.6 million in 2017 as compared to $84.9 million in 2016. Total costs and expenses increased 21% to $678.1 million in 2017 as compared to $560.9 million in 2016. This primarily reflects increased investment in our pipeline of preclinical and clinical-stage programs, increased drug product supply to Takeda, and higher staffing costs to support our continued growth. Net losses were $125.5 million and $140.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a gain of $33.8 million resulting from the change in the fair value of the Immunomedics warrant derivative as discussed below, and an income tax benefit of $33.4 million related to the change in the fair value of our Immunomedics common stock investment.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $413.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, and $677.6 million in total stockholders' equity. See \u201c-Recent developments\u201d above for a discussion on the underwritten public offering that was completed in February 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nWe evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nRevenue Recognition. Our revenues are comprised of ADCETRIS net product sales, amounts earned under our collaboration and licensing agreements and royalties. Under the accounting guidance that was in effect through December 31, 2017, revenue recognition was predicated upon persuasive evidence of an agreement existing, delivery of products or services being rendered, amounts payable being fixed or determinable, and collectibility being reasonably assured.\nWe adopted the Accounting Standards Update entitled \u201cASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. For additional information, see the section \u201cRecent accounting pronouncements\u201d in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d is based on accounting guidance in effect through December 31, 2017.\nNet product sales\nWe sell ADCETRIS through a limited number of pharmaceutical distributors. Customers order ADCETRIS through these distributors and we typically ship product directly to the customer. We record product sales when title and risk of loss pass, which generally occurs upon delivery of the product to the customer. Product sales are recorded net of estimated government-mandated rebates and chargebacks, distribution fees, estimated product returns and other deductions. These are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions. Accruals are established for these deductions and actual amounts incurred are offset against applicable accruals. We reflect these accruals as either a reduction in the related account receivable from the distributor, or as an accrued liability depending on the nature of the sales deduction. Sales deductions are based on our estimates that consider payer mix in target markets and our experience to date. These estimates involve a substantial degree of judgment.\nGovernment-mandated rebates and chargebacks: We have entered into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This agreement provides for a rebate based on covered purchases of ADCETRIS. Medicaid rebates are invoiced to us by the various state Medicaid programs. We estimate Medicaid rebates based on a variety of factors, including our experience to date. We also have completed our Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, agreement under which certain U.S. government purchasers receive a discount on eligible purchases of ADCETRIS. We have entered into a Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, which enables certain entities that qualify for government pricing under the Public Health Services Act, or PHS, to receive discounts on their qualified purchases of ADCETRIS. Under these agreements, distributors process a chargeback to us for the difference between wholesale acquisition cost and the applicable discounted price. As a result of our direct-ship distribution model, we can identify the entities purchasing ADCETRIS and this information enables us to estimate expected chargebacks for FSS and PHS purchases based on each entity's eligibility for the FSS and PHS programs. We also review actual rebate and chargeback information to further refine these estimates.\nDistribution fees, product returns and other deductions: Our distributors charge a volume-based fee for distribution services that they perform for us. We allow for the return of product that is within 30 days of its expiration date or that is damaged. We estimate product returns based on our experience to date. In addition, we consider our direct-ship distribution model, our belief that product is not typically held in the distribution channel, and the expected rapid use of the product by healthcare providers. We provide financial assistance to qualifying patients that are underinsured or cannot cover the cost of commercial coinsurance amounts through SeaGen Secure. SeaGen Secure is available to patients in the U.S. and its territories who meet various financial and treatment need criteria. Estimated contributions for commercial coinsurance under SeaGen Secure are deducted from gross sales and are based on an analysis of expected plan utilization. These estimates are adjusted as necessary to reflect our actual experience.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues\nWe have collaboration and license agreements with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Our proprietary ADC technologies are the basis of many of our collaboration and license agreements, including our ADC collaborations that we have entered into in the ordinary course of our business under which we grant our collaborators research and commercial licenses to our technology and typically provide technology transfer services, technical advice, supplies and services for a period of time.\nIf there are continuing performance obligations, we use a time-based proportional performance model to recognize revenue over our performance period for the related agreement when no other discernible pattern exists. Collaboration and license agreements are evaluated to determine whether the multiple elements and associated deliverables can be considered separate units of accounting. To date, the pre-commercial deliverables under our collaboration and license agreements have not qualified as separate units of accounting. The assessment of multiple element arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate point in time, or period of time, that revenue should be recognized. We believe that the development period in each agreement is a reasonable estimate of the performance obligation period of such agreement. Accordingly, all amounts received or due, including any upfront payments, maintenance fees, development and regulatory milestone payments and reimbursement payments, are recognized as revenue over the performance obligation periods of each agreement. These performance obligation periods typically range from one to three years. The agreements with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, and Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, or Genentech, have performance obligation periods of ten and seventeen years, respectively. All of the remaining performance obligation periods for our active collaborations are currently expected to be completed in three years or less. When no performance obligations are required of us, or following the completion of the performance obligation period, such amounts are recognized as revenue when collectibility is reasonably assured. Generally, all amounts received or due other than sales-based milestones and royalties are classified as collaboration and license agreement revenues as they are earned. Sales-based milestones and royalties are recognized as royalty revenue as they are reported to us.\nOur collaboration and license agreements include contractual milestones. Generally, the milestone events contained in our collaboration and license agreements coincide with the progression of the collaborators' product candidates from development to regulatory approval and then to commercialization.\nDevelopment milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events:\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Designation of a product candidate or initiation of pre-clinical studies. Our collaborators must undertake significant pre-clinical research and studies to make a determination of the suitability of a product candidate and the time from those studies or designation to initiation of a clinical trial may take several years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Initiation of a phase 1 clinical trial. Generally, phase 1 clinical trials may take one to two years to complete.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Initiation of a phase 2 clinical trial. Generally, phase 2 clinical trials may take one to three years to complete.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Initiation of a phase 3 clinical trial. Generally, phase 3 clinical trials may take two to six years to complete.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRegulatory milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events:\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Filing of regulatory applications for marketing approval such as a BLA in the United States or a Marketing Authorization Application in Europe. Generally, it may take up to twelve months to prepare and submit regulatory filings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Receiving marketing approval in a major market, such as in the United States, Europe, Japan or other significant countries. Generally it may take up to three years after a marketing application is submitted to obtain approval for marketing and pricing from the applicable regulatory agency.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommercialization milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events:\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> First commercial sale in a particular market, such as in the United States, Europe, Japan or other significant countries.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> Product sales in excess of a pre-specified threshold. The amount of time to achieve this type of milestone depends on several factors, including, but not limited to, the dollar amount of the threshold, the pricing of the product, market penetration of the product and the rate at which customers begin using the product.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur ADC collaborators are solely responsible for the development of their product candidates and the achievement of milestones in any of the categories identified above is based solely on the collaborators' efforts.\nIn the case of our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda, we may be involved in certain development activities; however, the achievement of milestone events under the agreement is primarily based on activities undertaken by Takeda.\nThe process of successfully developing a product candidate, obtaining regulatory approval and ultimately commercializing a product candidate is highly uncertain and the attainment of any milestones is therefore uncertain and difficult to predict. In addition, since we do not take a substantive role or control the research, development or commercialization of any products generated by our ADC collaborators, we are not able to reasonably estimate when, if at all, any milestone payments or royalties may be payable to us by our ADC collaborators. As such, the milestone payments associated with our ADC collaborations involve a substantial degree of uncertainty and risk that they may never be received. Similarly, even in those collaborations where we may have an active role in the development of the product candidate, such as our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda, the attainment of a milestone is based on the collaborator's activities and is generally outside our direction and control.\nWe generally invoice our collaborators and licensees on a monthly or quarterly basis, or upon the completion of the effort or achievement of a milestone, based on the terms of each agreement. Any deferred revenue arising from amounts received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process is recognized as revenue in future periods when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nRoyalty revenues and cost of royalty revenues\nRoyalty revenues primarily reflect amounts earned under the ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda. These royalties include commercial sales-based milestones and sales royalties. Sales royalties are based on a percentage of Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS, with rates that range from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties depending on sales volumes and reset annually. Takeda bears a portion of third-party royalty costs owed on its sales of ADCETRIS. These amounts are included in our royalty revenues. Cost of royalty revenues reflect amounts owed to our third-party licensors related to Takeda's sales of ADCETRIS. These amounts are recognized in the quarter in which Takeda reports its sales activity to us, which is the quarter following the related sales. Royalty revenues also include certain amounts earned in connection with our ADC collaborations.\nInvestments. We have investments in debt and equity securities. We classify our investments as available-for-sale, which are reported at estimated fair value with the changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income and loss in stockholders' equity. Upon our adoption of the Accounting Standards Update entitled \u201cASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments: Overall\u201d on January 1, 2018, we are required to record changes in the fair value of equity securities in net income or loss. The fair value of our investments is subject to volatility and could adversely affect our future operating results.\nAccrued Liabilities. As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued liabilities. This process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for such services where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. We record these estimates in our consolidated financial statements as of each balance sheet date. Examples of estimated accrued liabilities include amounts due to contract research organizations and other costs in conjunction with clinical trials, amounts due in conjunction with manufacturing ADCETRIS and our product candidates, third-party royalties that accrue on our sales of ADCETRIS and professional service fees, among other items.\nIn accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period. If the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. In the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services, our actual liabilities would differ from such estimates. The date on which some services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations. We make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with GAAP.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist of salaries, benefits and other headcount-related costs of our research and development staff, preclinical activities, clinical trials and related manufacturing costs, lab supplies, contract and outside service fees, and facilities and overhead expenses. Research and development activities are expensed as incurred.\nClinical trial expenses are a significant component of research and development expenses, and we outsource a significant portion of these costs to third parties. Third-party clinical trial expenses include investigator fees, site costs, clinical research organization costs, and costs for central laboratory testing and data management. Costs associated with activities performed under research and development co-development collaborations are reflected in research and development expense. In-licensing fees, milestones, maintenance fees, and other costs to acquire technologies utilized in research and development for product candidates that have not yet received regulatory approval and that are not expected to have alternative future use are expensed when incurred.\nNon-refundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.\nShare-based Compensation. Share-based compensation cost is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options on the date of grant which requires certain estimates to be made by management, including the expected forfeiture rate and expected term of the options. We also make decisions regarding the method of calculating the expected stock price volatility and the risk free interest rate used in the model. Fluctuations that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost. We recognize this estimated fair value over the vesting period of the arrangement using the graded-vesting attribution method for stock options which vest ratably over the vesting period. For performance-based stock options, we recognized this estimated fair value over the service period of the award when we believe vesting of the performance-based stock options is considered probable. Once vesting of performance-based stock options is considered probable, we record compensation expense based on the portion of the service period elapsed to date, with a cumulative catch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize remaining compensation expense, if any, over the remaining estimated service period.\nThe fair value of each restricted stock unit, or RSU, equals the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. RSUs granted to date vest 100% at a single point in time. We therefore amortize the value of RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.\nLong-term Incentive Plans. We have long term incentive plans which provide eligible employees with the opportunity to receive performance-based incentive compensation, which may be comprised of cash, stock options, and/or restricted stock units. The payment of cash and the grant or vesting of equity are contingent upon the achievement of pre-determined regulatory milestones. We record compensation expense over the estimated service period for each milestone when we believe the milestone is considered probable, which we assess at each reporting date. Once a milestone is considered probable, we record compensation expense based on the portion of the service period elapsed to date with respect to that milestone, with a cumulative catch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize any remaining compensation expense, if any, over the remaining estimated service period.\nIncome Taxes. We have net deferred tax assets which are fully offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We believe that a full valuation allowance is appropriate as we have a history of net operating losses. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made, a portion of which would increase income (or decrease losses) in the period in which such a determination was made. We follow the guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the recognition of an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority.\nInventories. We consider regulatory approval of product candidates to be uncertain. Accordingly, we charge manufacturing costs to research and development expense until such time as a product has received regulatory approval for commercial sale. We began capitalizing ADCETRIS production costs into inventory following its accelerated approval by the FDA in 2011. ADCETRIS inventory that is deployed into clinical, research or development use is charged to research and development expense when it is no longer available for commercial sales. Production costs for our other product candidates continue to be charged to research and development expense.\nWe value our inventories at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined on a specific identification basis. Inventory includes the cost of materials, third-party contract manufacturing and overhead associated with the production of ADCETRIS. We would write-down inventory cost to net realizable value if we were to determine that we had any excess, obsolete or unsalable inventory.\nLoss Contingencies. We are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of our business. A loss contingency is recorded if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, among other factors, the probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the ultimate loss. Loss contingencies that we determine to be reasonably possible, but not probable, are disclosed but not recorded. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Legal fees incurred as a result of our involvement in legal proceedings are expensed as incurred.\nResults of Operations-Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and\nNet product sales\nWe sell ADCETRIS in the U.S. and Canada.\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017/2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016/2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net product sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>307,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>265,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>226,052 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet product sales increased in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior years primarily due to an increase in sales volume and, to a lesser extent, price increases. The increases in sales volumes in both periods were driven primarily by increased use of ADCETRIS across multiple lines of therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma and for the treatment of other malignancies.\nIn November 2017, the FDA approved ADCETRIS for the treatment of adult patients with pcALCL and CD30-expressing MF who have received prior systemic therapy. While we expect continued growth in ADCETRIS sales in 2018 as compared to 2017, we expect only modest sales growth in the near term as a result of the FDA approval of ADCETRIS for the treatment of patients with pcALCL and CD30-expressing MF who have received prior systemic therapy, subject to our ability to effectively commercialize ADCETRIS in this indication. Our ability to accelerate the rate of ADCETRIS sales growth in future periods, if at all, will be primarily dependent on our ability to continue to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use. Our efforts to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use will continue to require additional time and investment in clinical trials to complete and may not be successful.\nWe record product sales net of estimated government-mandated rebates and chargebacks, distribution fees, product returns and other deductions. These are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions. Gross-to-net deductions, net of related payments and credits, were as follows:\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

<td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMandatory government discounts are the most significant component of our total gross-to-net deductions and the discount percentage has been increasing. These discount percentages increased during 2017 and 2016 as\na result of price increases we instituted that exceeded the rate of inflation, and to a lesser extent in 2017, as a result of an increase in the proportion of our sales eligible for government mandated rebates or chargebacks. Generally, the change in government prices is limited to the rate of inflation. Distribution fees, product returns and other gross-to-net deductions were relatively stable as a percentage of our gross sales during 2017, 2016 and 2015. We expect future gross-to-net deductions to fluctuate based on the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates, as well as changes in the discount percentage which is impacted by potential future price increases, the rate of inflation, and other factors.\nAs a result of price increases and a continued increase in the percentage of our gross sales that are eligible for government mandated rebates and chargebacks, we expect gross-to-net deductions to increase in 2018 as compared to 2017. There has been extensive discussion in the United States about expanding government discount programs, including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, and pressure on pharmaceutical drug pricing is increasing. For example, the Bipartisan Budget Act, which was enacted on February 9, 2018, contains measures targeting the cost of drugs under federal health care programs, including, among others, an increase from 50% to 70% in the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D, effective January 1, 2019. Further, the Trump administration's budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains additional drug pricing initiatives that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, a measure to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid. If government discount programs are expanded or discounts are increased as a result of changes in regulations in the United States, our gross-to-net deductions will increase and our net sales will be negatively impacted.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues reflect amounts earned under product, ADC and co-development collaborations. These revenues reflect the earned portion of payments received by us for technology access and maintenance fees, milestone payments and reimbursement payments for research and development support that we provide to our collaborators. Collaboration and license agreement revenues by collaborator were as follows:\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017/2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016/2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Takeda\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74,872 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>158 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AbbVie\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108,632 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration revenues from Takeda fluctuate based on changes in the earned portion of reimbursement funding under the ADCETRIS collaboration, which are influenced by the activities each party is performing under the collaboration agreement at a given time. For example, when Takeda's level of spending on clinical collaboration activities increases above our own, our earned portion of reimbursement funding generally decreases. Additionally, we receive reimbursement for the cost of drug product supplied to Takeda for its use, the timing of which fluctuates based on Takeda's product supply needs. The earned portion of reimbursement funding fluctuates based upon how much drug product Takeda has purchased from us in a given period.\nCollaboration revenues from Takeda increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in drug product supply activities to Takeda. The increase in collaboration revenues from Takeda in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily reflected a decrease in clinical trial costs related to activity performed by Takeda as the ECHELON-1 and other studies advanced and an increase in drug product supply activities to Takeda.\nThe decrease in revenues from AbbVie in 2017 as compared to 2016 reflected the timing differences of development milestones and licensing fees as well as a decrease in the earned portion of milestone payments\nachieved in prior years. Revenues from AbbVie decreased in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in the earned portion of milestone payments achieved in prior years.\nChanges in revenues recognized from our other collaboration agreements, which include our ADC collaborations and our co-development collaborations, reflected the timing and the earned portion of development milestones and licensing fees.\nOur collaboration and license agreement revenues are impacted by the term and duration of those agreements and by progress-dependent milestones, annual maintenance fees and reimbursement of materials and support services. Collaboration and license agreement revenues may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the progress made by our collaborators with their product candidates, the level of support we provide to our collaborators, specifically to Takeda under our ADCETRIS collaboration, the timing of milestones achieved and our ability to enter into additional collaborations. We expect our collaboration and license agreement revenues in 2018 to be lower than 2017, driven by the lower expected volume of drug to be supplied to Takeda. We have a significant balance of deferred revenue, representing prior payments from our collaborators that have not yet been recognized as revenue. This deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue in future periods using a time-based approach as we fulfill our performance obligations.\nCollaboration Agreements\nTakeda\nOur ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda provides for the global co-development of ADCETRIS and the commercialization of ADCETRIS by Takeda in its territory. We received an upfront payment and have received and are entitled to receive progress- and sales-dependent milestone payments based on Takeda's achievement of significant events under the collaboration, in addition to tiered royalties with percentages ranging from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties based on net sales of ADCETRIS within Takeda's licensed territories. Additionally, the companies equally co-fund the cost of selected development activities conducted under the collaboration. We recognize as collaboration revenue the upfront payment, progress-dependent development and regulatory milestone payments, and net development cost reimbursement payments from Takeda over the ten-year development period of the collaboration, which began in 2009. When the performance of development activities under the collaboration results in us making a reimbursement payment to Takeda, the effect is to reduce the amount of collaboration revenue that we record. We also receive reimbursement for the cost of drug product supplied to Takeda for its use and, in some cases, pay Takeda for drug product they supply to us. The earned portion of net collaboration payments is reflected in collaboration and license agreement revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2017, total future potential milestone payments to us under the ADCETRIS collaboration could total approximately $165 million. Of the remaining amount, up to approximately $7 million relates to the achievement of development milestones, up to approximately $118 million relates to the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to approximately $40 million relates to the achievement of commercial milestones. As of December 31, 2017, $70 million in milestones had been achieved as a result of regulatory and commercial progress by Takeda.\nAstellas\nWe have an agreement with Agensys, which subsequently became an affiliate of Astellas, to jointly research, develop and commercialize ADCs for the treatment of several types of cancer. The collaboration encompasses combinations of our ADC technology with fully-human antibodies developed by Astellas to proprietary cancer targets.\nUnder this collaboration, we and Astellas are co-funding all development and commercialization costs for enfortumab vedotin and will share equally in any profits that may come from this product candidate if successfully commercialized. Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense.\nGenmab\nWe have an agreement with Genmab for the development and commercialization of ADCs for the treatment of several types of cancer.\nUnder this agreement, we exercised a co-development option for tisotumab vedotin in August 2017. We and Genmab will share all future costs and profits for development and commercialization of tisotumab vedotin on an equal basis. Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense. We will be responsible for tisotumab vedotin commercialization activities in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, while Genmab will be responsible for commercialization activities in all other territories. Each party has the option to co-promote up to a specified percentage of the sales effort in the other party's territories.\nUnum Therapeutics\nWe have a collaboration agreement with Unum to develop and commercialize novel ACTR therapies for cancer. We and Unum are developing two ACTR product candidates that combine Unum's ACTR technology with our antibodies. Unum is conducting preclinical research and clinical development activities through phase 1 clinical trials, and we are providing funding for these activities. The agreement calls for us to work together to co-develop and jointly fund programs after phase 1 clinical trials unless either company opts out. Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense.\nWe and Unum would co-commercialize any successfully developed product candidates and share any profits equally on any co-developed programs in the United States. We retain exclusive commercial rights outside of the United States, paying Unum a royalty that is a high single digit to mid-teens percentage of ex-U.S. sales. The potential future licensing and progress-dependent milestone payments to Unum under the collaboration may total up to $400 million between the two ACTR programs, payment of which is triggered by the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones.\nADC Collaboration Agreements\nWe have other active collaborations with a number of companies to allow them to use our proprietary ADC technology. Under these ADC collaborations, which we have entered into in the ordinary course of business, we typically receive or are entitled to receive upfront cash payments, progress- and sales-dependent milestones and royalties on net sales of products incorporating our ADC technology, as well as annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and materials provided under the agreements. These amounts are recognized as revenue as they are realized, or over the performance obligation period of the agreements during which we provide limited support to the collaborator. Our ADC collaborators are solely responsible for research, product development, manufacturing and commercialization of any product candidates under these collaborations, which includes achievement of the potential milestones.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our ADC collaborations had generated more than $375 million, primarily in the form of upfront and milestone payments. Total milestone payments to us under our current ADC collaborations could total up to approximately $2.9 billion if all potential product candidates achieved all of their milestone events. Of this amount, approximately $0.4 billion relates to the achievement of development milestones, approximately $1.1 billion relates to the achievement of regulatory milestones and approximately $1.4 billion relates to the achievement of commercial milestones. Since we do not control the research, development or commercialization of any of the products that would generate these milestones, we are not able to reasonably estimate when, if at all, any milestone payments or royalties may be payable by our collaborators. Successfully developing a product candidate, obtaining regulatory approval and ultimately commercializing it is a significantly lengthy and highly uncertain process which entails a significant risk of failure. In addition, business combinations, changes in a collaborator's business strategy and financial difficulties or other factors could result and have resulted in a collaborator abandoning or delaying development of its product candidates. As such, the milestone payments associated with our ADC collaborations and co-development agreements involve a\nsubstantial degree of risk and may never be received. Accordingly, we do not expect, and investors should not assume, that we will receive all of the potential milestone payments described above, and it is possible that we may never receive any significant milestone payments under these agreements.\nRoyalty revenues and cost of royalty revenues\nRoyalty revenues primarily reflect royalties paid to us by Takeda under the ADCETRIS collaboration. These royalties include commercial sales-based milestones and sales royalties. The royalty rate paid by Takeda is calculated as a percentage of Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS, ranges from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties depending on sales volumes, and resets annually. Takeda bears a portion of third-party royalty costs owed on sales of ADCETRIS in its territory. This amount is included in our royalty revenues. Cost of royalty revenues reflect amounts owed to our third-party licensors related to the sale of ADCETRIS in Takeda's territory.\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017/2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016/2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Royalty revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of royalty revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRoyalty revenues decreased in 2017 as compared to 2016, as 2016 included a one-time $20.0 million sales-based milestone triggered by Takeda. This decrease was partially offset by Takeda's higher sales volume and higher royalty rate in 2017. Royalty revenues increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to the one-time $20.0 million sales-based milestone triggered by Takeda, as well as Takeda's higher sales volume in 2016.\nCost of royalty revenues fluctuates based on the amount of net sales of ADCETRIS by Takeda in its territories.\nWe expect that royalty revenues will increase in 2018, as compared to 2017, primarily due to higher sales volume by Takeda. We expect cost of royalty revenues to increase in 2018 primarily due to anticipated increases in sales volumes in Takeda's territory and, to a lesser extent, increases in the applicable royalty rate.\nCost of sales\nADCETRIS cost of sales includes manufacturing costs of product sold, third-party royalty costs, amortization of technology license costs, and distribution and other costs.\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017/2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016/2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of sales increased in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods, primarily due to higher third-party royalty costs that were driven by increased sales volumes.

Research expenses also include research activities associated with our product candidates, such as preclinical translational biology and in vitro and in vivo studies, and IND-enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily reflected increases in both internal and co-development costs to support our growing pipeline of product candidates and, to a lesser extent, increases in staffing and related occupancy costs. The decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily the result of a $25.0 million technology access fee related to the initiation of our collaboration agreement with Unum in June of 2015, offset partially by increased staffing, facilities and other costs to support our growing pipeline of product candidates, as well as increases in technology access fees paid and cost reimbursements to Unum under our collaboration agreement.\nDevelopment and contract manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses, external contract manufacturing costs for the scale-up and pre-approval manufacturing of drug product used in research and our clinical trials, and costs for drug product supplied to our collaborators. Development and contract manufacturing expenses also include quality control and assurance activities, and storage and shipment of our product candidates. The increases in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods primarily reflected increased drug product supplied to Takeda and, to a lesser extent, increases in staffing and other costs to support our growing pipeline of product candidates. The increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 also included cost reimbursements to Astellas under our collaboration.\nClinical expenses include personnel, travel, occupancy costs, and external clinical trial costs including costs for clinical sites, clinical research organizations, contractors and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials. The increases in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods reflected increased clinical trial activity related to our product candidates, primarily enfortumab vedotin and ladiratuzumab vedotin, and related increases in personnel costs, offset in part by a decline in SGN-CD33A costs.\nWe utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development projects. We track human resource efforts expended on many of our programs for purposes of billing our collaborators for time incurred at agreed upon rates and for resource planning. We do not account for actual costs on a project basis as it relates to our infrastructure, facility, employee and other indirect costs; however, we do separately track significant third-party costs including clinical trial costs, manufacturing costs and other contracted service costs on a project basis. To that end, the following table shows third-party costs incurred for research, contract manufacturing of our product candidates and clinical and regulatory services, as well as pre-commercial milestone payments for in-licensed technology for ADCETRIS and certain of our clinical-stage product candidates. The table also presents other costs and overhead consisting of third-party costs for our preclinical stage programs, personnel, facilities and other indirect costs not directly charged to development programs.\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5 years)\nJanuary 1, 2013 to\nDecember 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017/2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016/2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>328,571 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SGN-CD33A (vadastuximab\ntalirine)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>213 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109,762 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ASG-22ME (enfortumab vedotin)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>272 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,569 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SGN-LIV1A (ladiratuzumab vedotin)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>292 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,770 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other clinical stage programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,404 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total third-party costs for clinical stage programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>159,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>611,076 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other costs and overhead\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>278,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>219,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>197,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>968,831 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>456,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>379,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>294,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,579,907 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThird-party costs for ADCETRIS increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in drug product supplied to Takeda, offset partially by a decrease in clinical trial activities. Third-party costs for ADCETRIS increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in drug product supplied to Takeda and, to a lesser extent, third-party clinical trial costs as we evaluated the use of ADCETRIS in other lines of therapy. The cost of drug product supplied to Takeda is charged to research and development expense. We are reimbursed for the drug product, which is included in collaboration and license agreement revenues.\nThird-party costs for SGN-CD33A decreased in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to the discontinuation of our phase 3 CASCADE and other SGN-CD33A clinical trials. Third-party costs for SGN-CD33A increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to increases in clinical trial costs and drug supply activities for then ongoing and anticipated additional clinical trials. At this time, we have no plans to initiate additional clinical trials of SGN-CD33A.\nThird-party costs for enfortumab vedotin and ladiratuzumab vedotin increased in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods primarily due to increases in drug supply activities and, to a lesser extent, clinical trial costs as we initiated additional clinical trials in 2017.\nThird-party costs for our other clinical stage programs were related to multiple earlier-stage development programs and were relatively consistent across 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nOther costs and overhead include third-party costs of our preclinical programs, including our strategic collaborations with Genmab and Unum, and costs associated with personnel and facilities. These costs increased\nin 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods due to increased development activities to expand our product pipeline, including increases in staffing levels and the expansion of our facilities to accommodate our growth.\nOur expenditures on our ADCETRIS clinical development program and on our current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion. In order to advance our product candidates toward commercialization, the product candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety, toxicology and efficacy studies. We then conduct clinical trials for those product candidates that take several years or more to complete. The length of time varies substantially based upon the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. Likewise, in order to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use, we are required to conduct additional extensive clinical trials. The cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors, including:\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the number of patients required in our clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the length of time required to enroll trial participants;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the number and location of sites included in the trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the costs of producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the safety and efficacy profile of the product candidate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the use of clinical research organizations to assist with the management of the trials; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the costs and timing of, and the ability to secure, regulatory approvals.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe anticipate that our total research and development expenses in 2018 will increase compared to 2017 due primarily to higher costs for the development of our product candidates, primarily enfortumab vedotin and ladiratuzumab vedotin, as well as the operation of the biologics manufacturing facility that we acquired in October 2017 and Cascadian research and development activities, if the Cascadian Acquisition closes. Certain ADCETRIS development activities, including some clinical studies, will be conducted by Takeda, the costs of which are not reflected in our research and development expenses. Because of these and other factors, expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors, including the degree of collaborative activities, timing of manufacturing campaigns, numbers of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial event.\nThe risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of ADCETRIS in any additional approved indications or of any of our product candidates.\nSelling, general and administrative\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017/2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016/2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167,233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods primarily due to higher costs for staffing to support our continued growth.

We acquired the warrant in February 2017 and received 8.7 million shares of Immunomedics common stock upon exercise in December 2017. The resulting shares of common stock are classified as available-for-sale securities and carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income and loss in stockholders' equity. The fair value of the Immunomedics common stock fluctuates based on changes in the stock price of Immunomedics. Upon our adoption of the Accounting Standards Update entitled \u201cASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments: Overall\u201d on January 1, 2018, we will record changes in the fair value of equity securities in net income or loss. To the extent that we continue to hold Immunomedics common stock or other equity securities, our operating results may fluctuate significantly.

Investment income increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a higher effective yield of our portfolio. Investment income increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to higher average investment balances following our public offering in September 2015, which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $526.6 million.\nIncome taxes\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017/2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016/2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/A: No amount in comparable period or not a meaningful comparison.\nThe income tax benefit was due to unrealized gains on our common stock investment in Immunomedics, which was offset by an income tax provision for the same amount in other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>413,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>618,974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>712,711 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>409,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>586,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>636,793 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stockholders' equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>677,569 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>634,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>685,911 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(118,900 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(96,971 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(133,203 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(375,850 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>554,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe changes in net cash from operating activities primarily are related to our net loss, working capital fluctuations and changes in our non-cash expenses, all of which are highly variable. The changes in cash from investing activities reflect differences between the proceeds received from sale and maturity of our investments and amounts reinvested, and for 2017 included $55.1 million paid for the Immunomedics common stock investment (as part of purchases of available-for-sale securities) and $41.7 million paid for the acquisition of a biologics manufacturing facility in October 2017. Cash from financing activities includes proceeds from stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan for all years presented, and for 2015 included $526.6 million in net proceeds from our public offering in September 2015.\nWe primarily have financed our operations through the issuance of equity securities, collections from commercial sales of ADCETRIS, and amounts received pursuant to product collaborations and our ADC collaborations. To a lesser degree, we have also financed our operations through royalty revenues and interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. These financing and revenue sources have allowed us to maintain adequate levels of cash and investments. See \u201c-Recent developments\u201d above for a discussion on the Cascadian Acquisition, as well as the underwritten public offering that was completed in February 2018.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and investments are held in a variety of non-interest bearing bank accounts and interest-bearing instruments subject to investment guidelines allowing for holdings in U.S. government and agency securities, corporate securities, taxable municipal bonds, commercial paper and money market accounts. Our investment portfolio is structured to provide for investment maturities and access to cash to fund our anticipated working capital needs. However, if our liquidity needs should be accelerated for any reason in the near term, or investments do not pay at maturity, we may be required to sell investment securities in our portfolio prior to their scheduled maturities, which may result in a loss. As of December 31, 2017, we had $413.2 million held in cash or investments scheduled to mature within the next twelve months.\nAt our currently planned spending rates, we believe that our financial resources, including the proceeds from our February 2018 public offering of common stock, together with product and royalty revenues from sales of ADCETRIS and the fees, milestone payments and reimbursements we expect to receive under our existing collaboration and license agreements, will be sufficient to fund the costs of the Cascadian Acquisition and to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. Changes in our spending rate may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner, such as increased development, manufacturing and clinical trial expenses in connection with our expanding pipeline programs, and the Cascadian Acquisition, our undertaking of additional programs, business activities, or entry into additional strategic transactions, including potential additional acquisitions of products, technologies or businesses.\nAccordingly, we may be required to, or may otherwise determine to, raise additional capital to fund those obligations. Further, in the event of a termination of the ADCETRIS collaboration agreement with Takeda, we would not receive development cost sharing payments or milestone payments or royalties for the development or sale of ADCETRIS in Takeda's territory, and we would be required to fund all ADCETRIS development and commercial activities. Any of these factors could lead to a need for us to raise additional capital.\nWe expect to make additional capital outlays and to increase operating expenditures over the next several years as we hire additional employees, support our preclinical development, manufacturing and clinical trial activities for ADCETRIS and our other pipeline programs, and expand internationally, as well as commercialize ADCETRIS and position ADCETRIS for potential additional regulatory approvals. In addition, we anticipate\ncommitting substantial capital resources to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the anticipated integration and development activities related to the acquired Cascadian business and Cascadian's product candidates, including tucatinib. Our commitment of resources to the continuing development, regulatory and commercialization activities for ADCETRIS, and the research, continued development and manufacturing of our product candidates will likely require us to raise substantial amounts of additional capital. Further, we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including licensing or otherwise acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses, and we may require significant additional capital in order to complete or otherwise provide funding for any additional acquisitions. We may seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods: corporate collaborations, licensing arrangements and public or private debt or equity financings. We do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will obtain financing on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs, which may adversely affect our business and operations.\nCommitments\nThe following table reflects our future minimum contractual commitments as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,982 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,535 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tenant improvements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Manufacturing, license & collaboration agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>256,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,569 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,910 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>304,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,445 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have entered into leases for our office and laboratory facilities expiring in 2018 through 2024 that contain rate escalations and options for us to extend the leases. Operating lease obligations in the table above do not assume the exercise by us of any extension options.\nManufacturing, license and collaboration agreement commitments include non-cancelable obligations under our manufacturing, license and collaboration agreements. A substantial portion of the minimum payments under manufacturing, license and collaboration agreements represents contractual obligations related to manufacturing our product candidates for use in our clinical trials and for commercial operations in the case of ADCETRIS.\nSome of our manufacturing, license and collaboration agreements provide for periodic maintenance fees over specified time periods, as well as payments by us upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones. Some of our licensing agreements obligate us to pay royalties from the low single digit to mid-teens based on net sales of products utilizing licensed technology. Such royalties are dependent on future product sales and are not provided for in the table above as they are dependent on events that have not yet occurred. Future milestone payments for research and pre-clinical stage development programs have not been included in the above table as the event triggering such payment or obligation has not yet occurred. The above table also excludes up to $400.0 million in potential future milestone payments to Unum under our collaboration agreement with Unum and up to approximately $98 million in potential future milestone payments to other third parties under license agreements for our clinical-stage development programs. These milestone payments generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental, clinical, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. These contingent payments have not been included in the above table as the event triggering such payment or obligation has not yet occurred.\nWe entered into a Merger Agreement with Cascadian in January 2018, and we entered into a license and collaboration agreement and related platform technology license agreement with Pieris in February 2018. We are obligated to make payments under these agreements, and those payments have not been included in the above\ntable as these agreements were executed after December 31, 2017.

Our antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, technology utilizes the targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies to deliver cell-killing agents directly to cancer cells. We are commercializing ADCETRIS\u00ae, or brentuximab vedotin, for the treatment of several types of lymphomas. We are also advancing a pipeline of novel therapies for solid tumors and blood-related cancers designed to address unmet medical needs and improve treatment outcomes for patients.\nADCETRIS\u00ae (brentuximab vedotin)\nOur marketed product ADCETRIS\u00ae is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Commission for four indications, encompassing several settings for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma, for relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or sALCL, and for certain types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL. ADCETRIS is commercially available in 70 countries, including in the United States, Canada, members of the European Union and Japan. We are collaborating with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS on a global basis. Under this collaboration, Seattle Genetics has retained commercial rights for ADCETRIS in the United States and its territories and in Canada, and Takeda has commercial rights in the rest of the world. Beyond our current labeled indications, we have a broad development strategy for ADCETRIS evaluating its therapeutic potential in earlier lines of therapy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, mature T-cell lymphoma, or MTCL, also known as peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL, including sALCL. We are also evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor, or CPI. We and our partners are currently conducting these phase 3 clinical trials of ADCETRIS, all of which are described in more detail under the heading \u201c-ADCETRIS and Lead Product Candidate Development Pipeline\u201d in Part I Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n \u2022 ECHELON-1: In collaboration with Takeda, we are investigating ADCETRIS plus AVD (adriamycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) versus ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) as frontline combination therapy in patients with previously untreated advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The ECHELON-1 trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that treatment with ADCETRIS plus AVD resulted in a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival. Interim analysis \n of overall survival, the key secondary endpoint, also trended in favor of the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm. The FDA granted BTD to ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for the frontline treatment of patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. In December 2017, the FDA granted Priority Review for the supplemental Biologics License Application, or sBLA, we submitted in November 2017 seeking approval of ADCETRIS as part of a frontline combination chemotherapy regimen in patients with previously untreated advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date is May 1, 2018. \n \u2022 ECHELON-2: In collaboration with Takeda, we are evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with CHP versus CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) for the treatment of newly-diagnosed MTCL patients. In November 2016, we and Takeda completed enrollment of 452 patients in the ECHELON-2 trial, and we expect to report top-line data in 2018. \n \u2022 CHECKMATE 812: In collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, we are evaluating the combination of BMS's immunotherapy nivolumab (Opdivo) with ADCETRIS for the treatment of relapsed or refractory, or transplant-ineligible, advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. \nClinical-stage product candidates\nIn collaboration with Astellas Pharma, Inc., or Astellas, we are developing enfortumab vedotin, formerly known as ASG-22ME. We and Astellas are conducting a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with CPI therapy. We and Astellas also initiated a phase 1b trial of enfortumab vedotin in combination with CPI therapy for patients with first- or second-line locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.\nIn collaboration with Genmab A/S, or Genmab, we are developing tisotumab vedotin. We and Genmab plan to initiate a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer.\nWe have a collaboration with Unum Therapeutics, Inc., or Unum, to develop and commercialize novel antibody-coupled T-cell receptor, or ACTR, therapies incorporating our antibodies for the treatment of cancer.\nOur earlier-stage clinical pipeline includes other ADC programs consisting of ladiratuzumab vedotin, denintuzumab mafodotin, SGN-CD19B, SGN-CD123A, SGN-CD33A and SGN-CD352A, as well as immuno-oncology agents, SEA-CD40, which is based on our sugar-engineered antibody, or SEA, technology, and SGN-2FF, which is a novel small molecule. In addition, we have multiple preclinical and research-stage programs that employ our proprietary technologies, including SGN-CD48A.\nWe have collaborations for our ADC technology with a number of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd., or AbbVie; Bayer Pharma AG, or Bayer; Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., or Celldex; Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, or Genentech; GlaxoSmithKline LLC, or GSK; Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer; and PSMA Development Company LLC, a subsidiary of Progenics Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Progenics.\nRecent developments\nOn January 30, 2018, we entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Cascadian Therapeutics, Inc., or Cascadian, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company based in Seattle, Washington, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Cascadian for $10.00 per share net to the seller in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, which we estimate is approximately $614.1 million in the aggregate. Valley Acquisition Sub, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, has commenced the offer contemplated by the Merger Agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Cascadian common stock, or the Tender Offer, and as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Tender Offer, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, our wholly owned subsidiary will merge with and into Cascadian, or the Merger, and Cascadian will\nsurvive as our subsidiary. Our obligation to complete the Tender Offer and the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions. We refer to the Tender Offer and Merger together in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the Cascadian Acquisition. We expect to consummate the Cascadian Acquisition in first quarter of 2018. For additional details about the Cascadian Acquisition, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Proposed Acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics\u201d above.\nOn February 5, 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 13,269,230 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $52.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to us of approximately $690.0 million, before deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use the proceeds from the recently-completed public offering to fund a portion of the costs of the Cascadian Acquisition. In addition, as a result of the net proceeds to us from the public offering exceeding $400.0 million, the senior secured bridge loan facility various banks committed to provide to us on January 30, 2018 in connection with the Cascadian Acquisition is no longer available to us in accordance with the terms of the related commitment letter.\nOn February 8, 2018, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement and related platform technology license agreement with Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Pieris Pharmaceuticals AG, or together, Pieris, to develop novel bispecifics incorporating our antibodies and Pieris' proprietary Anticalin proteins for the treatment of cancer. For additional details about this agreement, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Corporate Collaborations\u201d above.\nOutlook\nOur ongoing research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities, together with the anticipated consummation of the Cascadian Acquisition and the anticipated integration and development activities related to the acquired Cascadian business and Cascadian's product candidates, including tucatinib, will require substantial amounts of capital and may not ultimately be successful. In addition, we may encounter unexpected difficulties during our anticipated integration and development activities related to the acquired Cascadian business and Cascadian's product candidates, any of which may cause us to expend greater funds and efforts or may slow, delay or limit development progress with respect to Cascadian's product candidates that we may acquire in the Cascadian Acquisition. Over the next several years, we expect that we will incur substantial expenses, primarily as a result of activities related to the commercialization of ADCETRIS, the continued development of ADCETRIS, enfortumab vedotin, and tisotumab vedotin, and, if the Cascadian Acquisition is completed, tucatinib. Our other product candidates are in relatively early stages of development. Enfortumab vedotin, tisotumab vedotin and our other product candidates will require significant further development, financial resources and personnel to pursue and obtain regulatory approval and develop into commercially viable products, if at all. Our commitment of resources to the continuing development, regulatory and commercialization activities for ADCETRIS, the research, continued development and manufacturing of our product candidates and expansion of our pipeline, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and the anticipated integration and development activities related to the acquired Cascadian business and Cascadian's product candidates will likely require us to raise substantial amounts of additional capital and our operating expenses may fluctuate as a result of such activities. We may also incur significant milestone payment obligations to certain of our licensors as our product candidates progress through clinical trials towards potential commercialization.\nIn addition, we may be unable to complete the Cascadian Acquisition. Even if completed, the success of the Cascadian Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our business with the business of Cascadian and to advance the development of Cascadian's product candidates. For additional details on these risks, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Cascadian Acquisition\u201d above.\nWe recognize revenue from ADCETRIS product sales in the United States and Canada. Our future ADCETRIS product sales are difficult to accurately predict from period to period. In this regard, our product sales have varied, and may continue to vary, significantly from period to period and may be affected by a variety of factors. Such factors include the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for ADCETRIS is available\nfrom government and other third-party payers, competition, the incidence rate of new patients in ADCETRIS' approved indications, customer ordering patterns, the overall level of demand for ADCETRIS, and the duration of therapy for patients receiving ADCETRIS. In particular:\n \u2022 Obtaining and maintaining appropriate coverage and reimbursement for ADCETRIS is increasingly challenging due to, among other things, the attention being paid to healthcare cost containment and other austerity measures in the U.S. and worldwide, as well as increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to pharmaceutical drug pricing practices. We anticipate that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and an additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for ADCETRIS. We also anticipate that Congress, state legislatures, and third-party payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system, any of which could negatively affect our revenue or sales of ADCETRIS (or any future approved products). \n \u2022 The competition ADCETRIS faces from competing therapies is intensifying, and we anticipate that we will continue to face increasing competition in the future as new companies enter our market and scientific developments surrounding biosimilars and other cancer therapies continue to accelerate. \n \u2022 We believe that the level of our current ADCETRIS sales in the United States has been attributable to the incidence flow of patients eligible for treatment with ADCETRIS, which can vary significantly from period to period. Moreover, we believe that the incidence rate in ADCETRIS' approved indications is relatively low, particularly when compared to many other oncology indications. In addition, we expect only modest sales growth in the near term as a result of the November 2017 FDA approval of ADCETRIS for the treatment of patients with primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or pcALCL, and CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides, or MF, who have received prior systemic therapy, subject to our ability to effectively commercialize ADCETRIS in this indication. \nFor these and other reasons, we expect that our ability to accelerate ADCETRIS sales growth, if at all, will depend primarily on our ability to continue to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use, particularly with respect to the frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and frontline MTCL indications. Our efforts to continue to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use will continue to require additional time and investment in clinical trials to complete and may not be successful. Our ability to successfully commercialize ADCETRIS and to continue to expand its labeled indications of use are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In particular, although we reported positive top line data in our ECHELON-1 trial in June 2017, there can be no assurance that either we or Takeda will ultimately obtain regulatory approvals of ADCETRIS in the ECHELON-1 treatment setting in our respective territories, which would limit our sales of, and the commercial potential of, ADCETRIS. Likewise, we may fail to commercialize ADCETRIS in pcALCL and CD30-expressing MF patients or in the ECHELON-1 treatment setting if our sBLA that we submitted in November 2017 is approved by the FDA, either of which would limit our sales of, and the commercial potential of ADCETRIS. In addition, negative or inconclusive results in our ECHELON-2 trial would negatively impact, or preclude altogether, our and Takeda's ability to obtain regulatory approvals in the frontline MTCL indication in our respective territories, which would also limit our sales of, and the commercial potential of, ADCETRIS.\nWe also expect that amounts earned from our collaboration agreements, including royalties, will continue to be an important source of our revenues and cash flows. These revenues will be impacted by future development funding and the achievement of development, clinical and commercial success by our collaborators under our existing collaboration and license agreements, including our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda, as well as by entering into potential new collaboration and license agreements. Our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and from quarter to quarter and, as a result, we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as being indicative of our future performance.\nFinancial summary\nTotal revenues increased 15% to $482.3 million in 2017, compared to $418.1 million in 2016. This increase was primarily driven by ADCETRIS net product sales that increased 16% to $307.6 million in 2017 as compared to $265.8 million in 2016, and by collaboration and license agreement revenues that increased 28% to $108.6 million in 2017 as compared to $84.9 million in 2016. Total costs and expenses increased 21% to $678.1 million in 2017 as compared to $560.9 million in 2016. This primarily reflects increased investment in our pipeline of preclinical and clinical-stage programs, increased drug product supply to Takeda, and higher staffing costs to support our continued growth. Net losses were $125.5 million and $140.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a gain of $33.8 million resulting from the change in the fair value of the Immunomedics warrant derivative as discussed below, and an income tax benefit of $33.4 million related to the change in the fair value of our Immunomedics common stock investment.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $413.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, and $677.6 million in total stockholders' equity. See \u201c-Recent developments\u201d above for a discussion on the underwritten public offering that was completed in February 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nWe evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nRevenue Recognition. Our revenues are comprised of ADCETRIS net product sales, amounts earned under our collaboration and licensing agreements and royalties. Under the accounting guidance that was in effect through December 31, 2017, revenue recognition was predicated upon persuasive evidence of an agreement existing, delivery of products or services being rendered, amounts payable being fixed or determinable, and collectibility being reasonably assured.\nWe adopted the Accounting Standards Update entitled \u201cASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. For additional information, see the section \u201cRecent accounting pronouncements\u201d in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d is based on accounting guidance in effect through December 31, 2017.\nNet product sales\nWe sell ADCETRIS through a limited number of pharmaceutical distributors. Customers order ADCETRIS through these distributors and we typically ship product directly to the customer. We record product sales when title and risk of loss pass, which generally occurs upon delivery of the product to the customer. Product sales are recorded net of estimated government-mandated rebates and chargebacks, distribution fees, estimated product returns and other deductions. These are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions. Accruals are established for these deductions and actual amounts incurred are offset against applicable accruals. We reflect these accruals as either a reduction in the related account receivable from the distributor, or as an accrued liability depending on the nature of the sales deduction. Sales deductions are based on our estimates that consider payer mix in target markets and our experience to date. These estimates involve a substantial degree of judgment.\nGovernment-mandated rebates and chargebacks: We have entered into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This agreement provides for a rebate based on covered purchases of ADCETRIS. Medicaid rebates are invoiced to us by the various state Medicaid programs. We estimate Medicaid rebates based on a variety of factors, including our experience to date. We also have completed our Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, agreement under which certain U.S. government purchasers receive a discount on eligible purchases of ADCETRIS. We have entered into a Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, which enables certain entities that qualify for government pricing under the Public Health Services Act, or PHS, to receive discounts on their qualified purchases of ADCETRIS. Under these agreements, distributors process a chargeback to us for the difference between wholesale acquisition cost and the applicable discounted price. As a result of our direct-ship distribution model, we can identify the entities purchasing ADCETRIS and this information enables us to estimate expected chargebacks for FSS and PHS purchases based on each entity's eligibility for the FSS and PHS programs. We also review actual rebate and chargeback information to further refine these estimates.\nDistribution fees, product returns and other deductions: Our distributors charge a volume-based fee for distribution services that they perform for us. We allow for the return of product that is within 30 days of its expiration date or that is damaged. We estimate product returns based on our experience to date. In addition, we consider our direct-ship distribution model, our belief that product is not typically held in the distribution channel, and the expected rapid use of the product by healthcare providers. We provide financial assistance to qualifying patients that are underinsured or cannot cover the cost of commercial coinsurance amounts through SeaGen Secure. SeaGen Secure is available to patients in the U.S. and its territories who meet various financial and treatment need criteria. Estimated contributions for commercial coinsurance under SeaGen Secure are deducted from gross sales and are based on an analysis of expected plan utilization. These estimates are adjusted as necessary to reflect our actual experience.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues\nWe have collaboration and license agreements with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Our proprietary ADC technologies are the basis of many of our collaboration and license agreements, including our ADC collaborations that we have entered into in the ordinary course of our business under which we grant our collaborators research and commercial licenses to our technology and typically provide technology transfer services, technical advice, supplies and services for a period of time.\nIf there are continuing performance obligations, we use a time-based proportional performance model to recognize revenue over our performance period for the related agreement when no other discernible pattern exists. Collaboration and license agreements are evaluated to determine whether the multiple elements and associated deliverables can be considered separate units of accounting. To date, the pre-commercial deliverables under our collaboration and license agreements have not qualified as separate units of accounting. The assessment of multiple element arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate point in time, or period of time, that revenue should be recognized. We believe that the development period in each agreement is a reasonable estimate of the performance obligation period of such agreement. Accordingly, all amounts received or due, including any upfront payments, maintenance fees, development and regulatory milestone payments and reimbursement payments, are recognized as revenue over the performance obligation periods of each agreement. These performance obligation periods typically range from one to three years. The agreements with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, and Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, or Genentech, have performance obligation periods of ten and seventeen years, respectively. All of the remaining performance obligation periods for our active collaborations are currently expected to be completed in three years or less. When no performance obligations are required of us, or following the completion of the performance obligation period, such amounts are recognized as revenue when collectibility is reasonably assured. Generally, all amounts received or due other than sales-based milestones and royalties are classified as collaboration and license agreement revenues as they are earned. Sales-based milestones and royalties are recognized as royalty revenue as they are reported to us.\nOur collaboration and license agreements include contractual milestones. Generally, the milestone events contained in our collaboration and license agreements coincide with the progression of the collaborators' product candidates from development to regulatory approval and then to commercialization.\nDevelopment milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events:\n \u2022 Designation of a product candidate or initiation of pre-clinical studies. Our collaborators must undertake significant pre-clinical research and studies to make a determination of the suitability of a product candidate and the time from those studies or designation to initiation of a clinical trial may take several years. \n \u2022 Initiation of a phase 1 clinical trial. Generally, phase 1 clinical trials may take one to two years to complete. \n \u2022 Initiation of a phase 2 clinical trial. Generally, phase 2 clinical trials may take one to three years to complete. \n \u2022 Initiation of a phase 3 clinical trial. Generally, phase 3 clinical trials may take two to six years to complete. \nRegulatory milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events:\n \u2022 Filing of regulatory applications for marketing approval such as a BLA in the United States or a Marketing Authorization Application in Europe. Generally, it may take up to twelve months to prepare and submit regulatory filings. \n \u2022 Receiving marketing approval in a major market, such as in the United States, Europe, Japan or other significant countries. Generally it may take up to three years after a marketing application is submitted to obtain approval for marketing and pricing from the applicable regulatory agency. \nCommercialization milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events:\n \u2022 First commercial sale in a particular market, such as in the United States, Europe, Japan or other significant countries. \n \u2022 Product sales in excess of a pre-specified threshold. The amount of time to achieve this type of milestone depends on several factors, including, but not limited to, the dollar amount of the threshold, the pricing of the product, market penetration of the product and the rate at which customers begin using the product. \nOur ADC collaborators are solely responsible for the development of their product candidates and the achievement of milestones in any of the categories identified above is based solely on the collaborators' efforts.\nIn the case of our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda, we may be involved in certain development activities; however, the achievement of milestone events under the agreement is primarily based on activities undertaken by Takeda.\nThe process of successfully developing a product candidate, obtaining regulatory approval and ultimately commercializing a product candidate is highly uncertain and the attainment of any milestones is therefore uncertain and difficult to predict. In addition, since we do not take a substantive role or control the research, development or commercialization of any products generated by our ADC collaborators, we are not able to reasonably estimate when, if at all, any milestone payments or royalties may be payable to us by our ADC collaborators. As such, the milestone payments associated with our ADC collaborations involve a substantial degree of uncertainty and risk that they may never be received. Similarly, even in those collaborations where we may have an active role in the development of the product candidate, such as our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda, the attainment of a milestone is based on the collaborator's activities and is generally outside our direction and control.\nWe generally invoice our collaborators and licensees on a monthly or quarterly basis, or upon the completion of the effort or achievement of a milestone, based on the terms of each agreement. Any deferred revenue arising from amounts received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process is recognized as revenue in future periods when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nRoyalty revenues and cost of royalty revenues\nRoyalty revenues primarily reflect amounts earned under the ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda. These royalties include commercial sales-based milestones and sales royalties. Sales royalties are based on a percentage of Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS, with rates that range from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties depending on sales volumes and reset annually. Takeda bears a portion of third-party royalty costs owed on its sales of ADCETRIS. These amounts are included in our royalty revenues. Cost of royalty revenues reflect amounts owed to our third-party licensors related to Takeda's sales of ADCETRIS. These amounts are recognized in the quarter in which Takeda reports its sales activity to us, which is the quarter following the related sales. Royalty revenues also include certain amounts earned in connection with our ADC collaborations.\nInvestments. We have investments in debt and equity securities. We classify our investments as available-for-sale, which are reported at estimated fair value with the changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income and loss in stockholders' equity. Upon our adoption of the Accounting Standards Update entitled \u201cASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments: Overall\u201d on January 1, 2018, we are required to record changes in the fair value of equity securities in net income or loss. The fair value of our investments is subject to volatility and could adversely affect our future operating results.\nAccrued Liabilities. As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued liabilities. This process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for such services where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. We record these estimates in our consolidated financial statements as of each balance sheet date. Examples of estimated accrued liabilities include amounts due to contract research organizations and other costs in conjunction with clinical trials, amounts due in conjunction with manufacturing ADCETRIS and our product candidates, third-party royalties that accrue on our sales of ADCETRIS and professional service fees, among other items.\nIn accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period. If the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. In the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services, our actual liabilities would differ from such estimates. The date on which some services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations. We make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with GAAP.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist of salaries, benefits and other headcount-related costs of our research and development staff, preclinical activities, clinical trials and related manufacturing costs, lab supplies, contract and outside service fees, and facilities and overhead expenses. Research and development activities are expensed as incurred.\nClinical trial expenses are a significant component of research and development expenses, and we outsource a significant portion of these costs to third parties. Third-party clinical trial expenses include investigator fees, site costs, clinical research organization costs, and costs for central laboratory testing and data management. Costs associated with activities performed under research and development co-development collaborations are reflected in research and development expense. In-licensing fees, milestones, maintenance fees, and other costs to acquire technologies utilized in research and development for product candidates that have not yet received regulatory approval and that are not expected to have alternative future use are expensed when incurred.\nNon-refundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.\nShare-based Compensation. Share-based compensation cost is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options on the date of grant which requires certain estimates to be made by management, including the expected forfeiture rate and expected term of the options. We also make decisions regarding the method of calculating the expected stock price volatility and the risk free interest rate used in the model. Fluctuations that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost. We recognize this estimated fair value over the vesting period of the arrangement using the graded-vesting attribution method for stock options which vest ratably over the vesting period. For performance-based stock options, we recognized this estimated fair value over the service period of the award when we believe vesting of the performance-based stock options is considered probable. Once vesting of performance-based stock options is considered probable, we record compensation expense based on the portion of the service period elapsed to date, with a cumulative catch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize remaining compensation expense, if any, over the remaining estimated service period.\nThe fair value of each restricted stock unit, or RSU, equals the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. RSUs granted to date vest 100% at a single point in time. We therefore amortize the value of RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.\nLong-term Incentive Plans. We have long term incentive plans which provide eligible employees with the opportunity to receive performance-based incentive compensation, which may be comprised of cash, stock options, and/or restricted stock units. The payment of cash and the grant or vesting of equity are contingent upon the achievement of pre-determined regulatory milestones. We record compensation expense over the estimated service period for each milestone when we believe the milestone is considered probable, which we assess at each reporting date. Once a milestone is considered probable, we record compensation expense based on the portion of the service period elapsed to date with respect to that milestone, with a cumulative catch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize any remaining compensation expense, if any, over the remaining estimated service period.\nIncome Taxes. We have net deferred tax assets which are fully offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We believe that a full valuation allowance is appropriate as we have a history of net operating losses. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made, a portion of which would increase income (or decrease losses) in the period in which such a determination was made. We follow the guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the recognition of an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority.\nInventories. We consider regulatory approval of product candidates to be uncertain. Accordingly, we charge manufacturing costs to research and development expense until such time as a product has received regulatory approval for commercial sale. We began capitalizing ADCETRIS production costs into inventory following its accelerated approval by the FDA in 2011. ADCETRIS inventory that is deployed into clinical, research or development use is charged to research and development expense when it is no longer available for commercial sales. Production costs for our other product candidates continue to be charged to research and development expense.\nWe value our inventories at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined on a specific identification basis. Inventory includes the cost of materials, third-party contract manufacturing and overhead associated with the production of ADCETRIS. We would write-down inventory cost to net realizable value if we were to determine that we had any excess, obsolete or unsalable inventory.\nLoss Contingencies. We are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of our business. A loss contingency is recorded if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, among other factors, the probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the ultimate loss. Loss contingencies that we determine to be reasonably possible, but not probable, are disclosed but not recorded. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Legal fees incurred as a result of our involvement in legal proceedings are expensed as incurred.\nResults of Operations-Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and\nNet product sales\nWe sell ADCETRIS in the U.S. and Canada.\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017/2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016/2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net product sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>307,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>265,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>226,052 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet product sales increased in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior years primarily due to an increase in sales volume and, to a lesser extent, price increases. The increases in sales volumes in both periods were driven primarily by increased use of ADCETRIS across multiple lines of therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma and for the treatment of other malignancies.\nIn November 2017, the FDA approved ADCETRIS for the treatment of adult patients with pcALCL and CD30-expressing MF who have received prior systemic therapy. While we expect continued growth in ADCETRIS sales in 2018 as compared to 2017, we expect only modest sales growth in the near term as a result of the FDA approval of ADCETRIS for the treatment of patients with pcALCL and CD30-expressing MF who have received prior systemic therapy, subject to our ability to effectively commercialize ADCETRIS in this indication. Our ability to accelerate the rate of ADCETRIS sales growth in future periods, if at all, will be primarily dependent on our ability to continue to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use. Our efforts to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use will continue to require additional time and investment in clinical trials to complete and may not be successful.\nWe record product sales net of estimated government-mandated rebates and chargebacks, distribution fees, product returns and other deductions. These are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions. Gross-to-net deductions, net of related payments and credits, were as follows:\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

<td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMandatory government discounts are the most significant component of our total gross-to-net deductions and the discount percentage has been increasing. These discount percentages increased during 2017 and 2016 as\na result of price increases we instituted that exceeded the rate of inflation, and to a lesser extent in 2017, as a result of an increase in the proportion of our sales eligible for government mandated rebates or chargebacks. Generally, the change in government prices is limited to the rate of inflation. Distribution fees, product returns and other gross-to-net deductions were relatively stable as a percentage of our gross sales during 2017, 2016 and 2015. We expect future gross-to-net deductions to fluctuate based on the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates, as well as changes in the discount percentage which is impacted by potential future price increases, the rate of inflation, and other factors.\nAs a result of price increases and a continued increase in the percentage of our gross sales that are eligible for government mandated rebates and chargebacks, we expect gross-to-net deductions to increase in 2018 as compared to 2017. There has been extensive discussion in the United States about expanding government discount programs, including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, and pressure on pharmaceutical drug pricing is increasing. For example, the Bipartisan Budget Act, which was enacted on February 9, 2018, contains measures targeting the cost of drugs under federal health care programs, including, among others, an increase from 50% to 70% in the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D, effective January 1, 2019. Further, the Trump administration's budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains additional drug pricing initiatives that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, a measure to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid. If government discount programs are expanded or discounts are increased as a result of changes in regulations in the United States, our gross-to-net deductions will increase and our net sales will be negatively impacted.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues reflect amounts earned under product, ADC and co-development collaborations. These revenues reflect the earned portion of payments received by us for technology access and maintenance fees, milestone payments and reimbursement payments for research and development support that we provide to our collaborators. Collaboration and license agreement revenues by collaborator were as follows:\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017/2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016/2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Takeda\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>74,872 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>158 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AbbVie\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,481 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31 </td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108,632 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration revenues from Takeda fluctuate based on changes in the earned portion of reimbursement funding under the ADCETRIS collaboration, which are influenced by the activities each party is performing under the collaboration agreement at a given time. For example, when Takeda's level of spending on clinical collaboration activities increases above our own, our earned portion of reimbursement funding generally decreases. Additionally, we receive reimbursement for the cost of drug product supplied to Takeda for its use, the timing of which fluctuates based on Takeda's product supply needs. The earned portion of reimbursement funding fluctuates based upon how much drug product Takeda has purchased from us in a given period.\nCollaboration revenues from Takeda increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in drug product supply activities to Takeda. The increase in collaboration revenues from Takeda in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily reflected a decrease in clinical trial costs related to activity performed by Takeda as the ECHELON-1 and other studies advanced and an increase in drug product supply activities to Takeda.\nThe decrease in revenues from AbbVie in 2017 as compared to 2016 reflected the timing differences of development milestones and licensing fees as well as a decrease in the earned portion of milestone payments\nachieved in prior years. Revenues from AbbVie decreased in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in the earned portion of milestone payments achieved in prior years.\nChanges in revenues recognized from our other collaboration agreements, which include our ADC collaborations and our co-development collaborations, reflected the timing and the earned portion of development milestones and licensing fees.\nOur collaboration and license agreement revenues are impacted by the term and duration of those agreements and by progress-dependent milestones, annual maintenance fees and reimbursement of materials and support services. Collaboration and license agreement revenues may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the progress made by our collaborators with their product candidates, the level of support we provide to our collaborators, specifically to Takeda under our ADCETRIS collaboration, the timing of milestones achieved and our ability to enter into additional collaborations. We expect our collaboration and license agreement revenues in 2018 to be lower than 2017, driven by the lower expected volume of drug to be supplied to Takeda. We have a significant balance of deferred revenue, representing prior payments from our collaborators that have not yet been recognized as revenue. This deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue in future periods using a time-based approach as we fulfill our performance obligations.\nCollaboration Agreements\nTakeda\nOur ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda provides for the global co-development of ADCETRIS and the commercialization of ADCETRIS by Takeda in its territory. We received an upfront payment and have received and are entitled to receive progress- and sales-dependent milestone payments based on Takeda's achievement of significant events under the collaboration, in addition to tiered royalties with percentages ranging from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties based on net sales of ADCETRIS within Takeda's licensed territories. Additionally, the companies equally co-fund the cost of selected development activities conducted under the collaboration. We recognize as collaboration revenue the upfront payment, progress-dependent development and regulatory milestone payments, and net development cost reimbursement payments from Takeda over the ten-year development period of the collaboration, which began in 2009. When the performance of development activities under the collaboration results in us making a reimbursement payment to Takeda, the effect is to reduce the amount of collaboration revenue that we record. We also receive reimbursement for the cost of drug product supplied to Takeda for its use and, in some cases, pay Takeda for drug product they supply to us. The earned portion of net collaboration payments is reflected in collaboration and license agreement revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2017, total future potential milestone payments to us under the ADCETRIS collaboration could total approximately $165 million. Of the remaining amount, up to approximately $7 million relates to the achievement of development milestones, up to approximately $118 million relates to the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to approximately $40 million relates to the achievement of commercial milestones. As of December 31, 2017, $70 million in milestones had been achieved as a result of regulatory and commercial progress by Takeda.\nAstellas\nWe have an agreement with Agensys, which subsequently became an affiliate of Astellas, to jointly research, develop and commercialize ADCs for the treatment of several types of cancer. The collaboration encompasses combinations of our ADC technology with fully-human antibodies developed by Astellas to proprietary cancer targets.\nUnder this collaboration, we and Astellas are co-funding all development and commercialization costs for enfortumab vedotin and will share equally in any profits that may come from this product candidate if successfully commercialized. Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense.\nGenmab\nWe have an agreement with Genmab for the development and commercialization of ADCs for the treatment of several types of cancer.\nUnder this agreement, we exercised a co-development option for tisotumab vedotin in August 2017. We and Genmab will share all future costs and profits for development and commercialization of tisotumab vedotin on an equal basis. Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense. We will be responsible for tisotumab vedotin commercialization activities in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, while Genmab will be responsible for commercialization activities in all other territories. Each party has the option to co-promote up to a specified percentage of the sales effort in the other party's territories.\nUnum Therapeutics\nWe have a collaboration agreement with Unum to develop and commercialize novel ACTR therapies for cancer. We and Unum are developing two ACTR product candidates that combine Unum's ACTR technology with our antibodies. Unum is conducting preclinical research and clinical development activities through phase 1 clinical trials, and we are providing funding for these activities. The agreement calls for us to work together to co-develop and jointly fund programs after phase 1 clinical trials unless either company opts out. Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense.\nWe and Unum would co-commercialize any successfully developed product candidates and share any profits equally on any co-developed programs in the United States. We retain exclusive commercial rights outside of the United States, paying Unum a royalty that is a high single digit to mid-teens percentage of ex-U.S. sales. The potential future licensing and progress-dependent milestone payments to Unum under the collaboration may total up to $400 million between the two ACTR programs, payment of which is triggered by the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones.\nADC Collaboration Agreements\nWe have other active collaborations with a number of companies to allow them to use our proprietary ADC technology. Under these ADC collaborations, which we have entered into in the ordinary course of business, we typically receive or are entitled to receive upfront cash payments, progress- and sales-dependent milestones and royalties on net sales of products incorporating our ADC technology, as well as annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and materials provided under the agreements. These amounts are recognized as revenue as they are realized, or over the performance obligation period of the agreements during which we provide limited support to the collaborator. Our ADC collaborators are solely responsible for research, product development, manufacturing and commercialization of any product candidates under these collaborations, which includes achievement of the potential milestones.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our ADC collaborations had generated more than $375 million, primarily in the form of upfront and milestone payments. Total milestone payments to us under our current ADC collaborations could total up to approximately $2.9 billion if all potential product candidates achieved all of their milestone events. Of this amount, approximately $0.4 billion relates to the achievement of development milestones, approximately $1.1 billion relates to the achievement of regulatory milestones and approximately $1.4 billion relates to the achievement of commercial milestones. Since we do not control the research, development or commercialization of any of the products that would generate these milestones, we are not able to reasonably estimate when, if at all, any milestone payments or royalties may be payable by our collaborators. Successfully developing a product candidate, obtaining regulatory approval and ultimately commercializing it is a significantly lengthy and highly uncertain process which entails a significant risk of failure. In addition, business combinations, changes in a collaborator's business strategy and financial difficulties or other factors could result and have resulted in a collaborator abandoning or delaying development of its product candidates. As such, the milestone payments associated with our ADC collaborations and co-development agreements involve a\nsubstantial degree of risk and may never be received. Accordingly, we do not expect, and investors should not assume, that we will receive all of the potential milestone payments described above, and it is possible that we may never receive any significant milestone payments under these agreements.\nRoyalty revenues and cost of royalty revenues\nRoyalty revenues primarily reflect royalties paid to us by Takeda under the ADCETRIS collaboration. These royalties include commercial sales-based milestones and sales royalties. The royalty rate paid by Takeda is calculated as a percentage of Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS, ranges from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties depending on sales volumes, and resets annually. Takeda bears a portion of third-party royalty costs owed on sales of ADCETRIS in its territory. This amount is included in our royalty revenues. Cost of royalty revenues reflect amounts owed to our third-party licensors related to the sale of ADCETRIS in Takeda's territory.\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017/2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016/2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Royalty revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of royalty revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRoyalty revenues decreased in 2017 as compared to 2016, as 2016 included a one-time $20.0 million sales-based milestone triggered by Takeda. This decrease was partially offset by Takeda's higher sales volume and higher royalty rate in 2017. Royalty revenues increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to the one-time $20.0 million sales-based milestone triggered by Takeda, as well as Takeda's higher sales volume in 2016.\nCost of royalty revenues fluctuates based on the amount of net sales of ADCETRIS by Takeda in its territories.\nWe expect that royalty revenues will increase in 2018, as compared to 2017, primarily due to higher sales volume by Takeda. We expect cost of royalty revenues to increase in 2018 primarily due to anticipated increases in sales volumes in Takeda's territory and, to a lesser extent, increases in the applicable royalty rate.\nCost of sales\nADCETRIS cost of sales includes manufacturing costs of product sold, third-party royalty costs, amortization of technology license costs, and distribution and other costs.\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017/2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016/2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of sales increased in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods, primarily due to higher third-party royalty costs that were driven by increased sales volumes.

Research expenses also include research activities associated with our product candidates, such as preclinical translational biology and in vitro and in vivo studies, and IND-enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily reflected increases in both internal and co-development costs to support our growing pipeline of product candidates and, to a lesser extent, increases in staffing and related occupancy costs. The decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily the result of a $25.0 million technology access fee related to the initiation of our collaboration agreement with Unum in June of 2015, offset partially by increased staffing, facilities and other costs to support our growing pipeline of product candidates, as well as increases in technology access fees paid and cost reimbursements to Unum under our collaboration agreement.\nDevelopment and contract manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses, external contract manufacturing costs for the scale-up and pre-approval manufacturing of drug product used in research and our clinical trials, and costs for drug product supplied to our collaborators. Development and contract manufacturing expenses also include quality control and assurance activities, and storage and shipment of our product candidates. The increases in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods primarily reflected increased drug product supplied to Takeda and, to a lesser extent, increases in staffing and other costs to support our growing pipeline of product candidates. The increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 also included cost reimbursements to Astellas under our collaboration.\nClinical expenses include personnel, travel, occupancy costs, and external clinical trial costs including costs for clinical sites, clinical research organizations, contractors and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials. The increases in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods reflected increased clinical trial activity related to our product candidates, primarily enfortumab vedotin and ladiratuzumab vedotin, and related increases in personnel costs, offset in part by a decline in SGN-CD33A costs.\nWe utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development projects. We track human resource efforts expended on many of our programs for purposes of billing our collaborators for time incurred at agreed upon rates and for resource planning. We do not account for actual costs on a project basis as it relates to our infrastructure, facility, employee and other indirect costs; however, we do separately track significant third-party costs including clinical trial costs, manufacturing costs and other contracted service costs on a project basis. To that end, the following table shows third-party costs incurred for research, contract manufacturing of our product candidates and clinical and regulatory services, as well as pre-commercial milestone payments for in-licensed technology for ADCETRIS and certain of our clinical-stage product candidates. The table also presents other costs and overhead consisting of third-party costs for our preclinical stage programs, personnel, facilities and other indirect costs not directly charged to development programs.\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5 years)\nJanuary 1, 2013 to\nDecember 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017/2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016/2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ADCETRIS (brentuximab vedotin)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>328,571 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SGN-CD33A (vadastuximab\ntalirine)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>213 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109,762 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ASG-22ME (enfortumab vedotin)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>272 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,569 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SGN-LIV1A (ladiratuzumab vedotin)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>292 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,770 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other clinical stage programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5 </td> <td>%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,404 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total third-party costs for clinical stage programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>159,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>611,076 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other costs and overhead\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>278,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>219,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>197,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>968,831 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>456,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>379,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>294,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,579,907 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThird-party costs for ADCETRIS increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in drug product supplied to Takeda, offset partially by a decrease in clinical trial activities. Third-party costs for ADCETRIS increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in drug product supplied to Takeda and, to a lesser extent, third-party clinical trial costs as we evaluated the use of ADCETRIS in other lines of therapy. The cost of drug product supplied to Takeda is charged to research and development expense. We are reimbursed for the drug product, which is included in collaboration and license agreement revenues.\nThird-party costs for SGN-CD33A decreased in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to the discontinuation of our phase 3 CASCADE and other SGN-CD33A clinical trials. Third-party costs for SGN-CD33A increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to increases in clinical trial costs and drug supply activities for then ongoing and anticipated additional clinical trials. At this time, we have no plans to initiate additional clinical trials of SGN-CD33A.\nThird-party costs for enfortumab vedotin and ladiratuzumab vedotin increased in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods primarily due to increases in drug supply activities and, to a lesser extent, clinical trial costs as we initiated additional clinical trials in 2017.\nThird-party costs for our other clinical stage programs were related to multiple earlier-stage development programs and were relatively consistent across 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nOther costs and overhead include third-party costs of our preclinical programs, including our strategic collaborations with Genmab and Unum, and costs associated with personnel and facilities. These costs increased\nin 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods due to increased development activities to expand our product pipeline, including increases in staffing levels and the expansion of our facilities to accommodate our growth.\nOur expenditures on our ADCETRIS clinical development program and on our current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion. In order to advance our product candidates toward commercialization, the product candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety, toxicology and efficacy studies. We then conduct clinical trials for those product candidates that take several years or more to complete. The length of time varies substantially based upon the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. Likewise, in order to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use, we are required to conduct additional extensive clinical trials. The cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n \u2022 the number of patients required in our clinical trials; \n \u2022 the length of time required to enroll trial participants; \n \u2022 the number and location of sites included in the trials; \n \u2022 the costs of producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions; \n \u2022 the safety and efficacy profile of the product candidate; \n \u2022 the use of clinical research organizations to assist with the management of the trials; and \n \u2022 the costs and timing of, and the ability to secure, regulatory approvals. \nWe anticipate that our total research and development expenses in 2018 will increase compared to 2017 due primarily to higher costs for the development of our product candidates, primarily enfortumab vedotin and ladiratuzumab vedotin, as well as the operation of the biologics manufacturing facility that we acquired in October 2017 and Cascadian research and development activities, if the Cascadian Acquisition closes. Certain ADCETRIS development activities, including some clinical studies, will be conducted by Takeda, the costs of which are not reflected in our research and development expenses. Because of these and other factors, expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors, including the degree of collaborative activities, timing of manufacturing campaigns, numbers of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial event.\nThe risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of ADCETRIS in any additional approved indications or of any of our product candidates.\nSelling, general and administrative\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017/2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016/2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167,233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods primarily due to higher costs for staffing to support our continued growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to higher expenses for legal matters.\nWe anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in 2018 as we continue our activities in support of the commercialization of ADCETRIS, as well as our support of general operations and Cascadian selling, general and administrative activities, if the Cascadian Acquisition closes.\nInvestment and other income, net\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017/2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016/2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net gain on Immunomedics warrant derivative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,777 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment income, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment and other income, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/A: No amount in comparable period or not a meaningful comparison.\nThe net gain on Immunomedics warrant derivative primarily was due to the increase in the fair value of the warrant derivative prior to it being exercised in December 2017. We acquired the warrant in February 2017 and received 8.7 million shares of Immunomedics common stock upon exercise in December 2017. The resulting shares of common stock are classified as available-for-sale securities and carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income and loss in stockholders' equity. The fair value of the Immunomedics common stock fluctuates based on changes in the stock price of Immunomedics. Upon our adoption of the Accounting Standards Update entitled \u201cASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments: Overall\u201d on January 1, 2018, we will record changes in the fair value of equity securities in net income or loss. To the extent that we continue to hold Immunomedics common stock or other equity securities, our operating results may fluctuate significantly. For additional information on our adoption of this ASU, see the section \u201cRecent accounting pronouncements\u201d in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment income reflects amounts earned on our investments in U.S. Treasury securities. Investment income increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a higher effective yield of our portfolio. Investment income increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to higher average investment balances following our public offering in September 2015, which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $526.6 million.\nIncome taxes\nTable 209: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017/2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016/2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/A: No amount in comparable period or not a meaningful comparison.\nThe income tax benefit was due to unrealized gains on our common stock investment in Immunomedics, which was offset by an income tax provision for the same amount in other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>413,171 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>618,974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>712,711 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>409,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>586,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>636,793 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stockholders' equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>677,569 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>634,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>685,911 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(118,900 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(96,971 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(133,203 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>129,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(375,850 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>554,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe changes in net cash from operating activities primarily are related to our net loss, working capital fluctuations and changes in our non-cash expenses, all of which are highly variable. The changes in cash from investing activities reflect differences between the proceeds received from sale and maturity of our investments and amounts reinvested, and for 2017 included $55.1 million paid for the Immunomedics common stock investment (as part of purchases of available-for-sale securities) and $41.7 million paid for the acquisition of a biologics manufacturing facility in October 2017. Cash from financing activities includes proceeds from stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan for all years presented, and for 2015 included $526.6 million in net proceeds from our public offering in September 2015.\nWe primarily have financed our operations through the issuance of equity securities, collections from commercial sales of ADCETRIS, and amounts received pursuant to product collaborations and our ADC collaborations. To a lesser degree, we have also financed our operations through royalty revenues and interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. These financing and revenue sources have allowed us to maintain adequate levels of cash and investments. See \u201c-Recent developments\u201d above for a discussion on the Cascadian Acquisition, as well as the underwritten public offering that was completed in February 2018.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and investments are held in a variety of non-interest bearing bank accounts and interest-bearing instruments subject to investment guidelines allowing for holdings in U.S. government and agency securities, corporate securities, taxable municipal bonds, commercial paper and money market accounts. Our investment portfolio is structured to provide for investment maturities and access to cash to fund our anticipated working capital needs. However, if our liquidity needs should be accelerated for any reason in the near term, or investments do not pay at maturity, we may be required to sell investment securities in our portfolio prior to their scheduled maturities, which may result in a loss. As of December 31, 2017, we had $413.2 million held in cash or investments scheduled to mature within the next twelve months.\nAt our currently planned spending rates, we believe that our financial resources, including the proceeds from our February 2018 public offering of common stock, together with product and royalty revenues from sales of ADCETRIS and the fees, milestone payments and reimbursements we expect to receive under our existing collaboration and license agreements, will be sufficient to fund the costs of the Cascadian Acquisition and to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. Changes in our spending rate may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner, such as increased development, manufacturing and clinical trial expenses in connection with our expanding pipeline programs, and the Cascadian Acquisition, our undertaking of additional programs, business activities, or entry into additional strategic transactions, including potential additional acquisitions of products, technologies or businesses.\nAccordingly, we may be required to, or may otherwise determine to, raise additional capital to fund those obligations. Further, in the event of a termination of the ADCETRIS collaboration agreement with Takeda, we would not receive development cost sharing payments or milestone payments or royalties for the development or sale of ADCETRIS in Takeda's territory, and we would be required to fund all ADCETRIS development and commercial activities. Any of these factors could lead to a need for us to raise additional capital.\nWe expect to make additional capital outlays and to increase operating expenditures over the next several years as we hire additional employees, support our preclinical development, manufacturing and clinical trial activities for ADCETRIS and our other pipeline programs, and expand internationally, as well as commercialize ADCETRIS and position ADCETRIS for potential additional regulatory approvals. In addition, we anticipate\ncommitting substantial capital resources to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the anticipated integration and development activities related to the acquired Cascadian business and Cascadian's product candidates, including tucatinib. Our commitment of resources to the continuing development, regulatory and commercialization activities for ADCETRIS, and the research, continued development and manufacturing of our product candidates will likely require us to raise substantial amounts of additional capital. Further, we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including licensing or otherwise acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses, and we may require significant additional capital in order to complete or otherwise provide funding for any additional acquisitions. We may seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods: corporate collaborations, licensing arrangements and public or private debt or equity financings. We do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will obtain financing on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs, which may adversely affect our business and operations.\nCommitments\nThe following table reflects our future minimum contractual commitments as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,982 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,535 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tenant improvements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Manufacturing, license & collaboration agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>256,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,569 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,910 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>304,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,445 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have entered into leases for our office and laboratory facilities expiring in 2018 through 2024 that contain rate escalations and options for us to extend the leases. Operating lease obligations in the table above do not assume the exercise by us of any extension options.\nManufacturing, license and collaboration agreement commitments include non-cancelable obligations under our manufacturing, license and collaboration agreements. A substantial portion of the minimum payments under manufacturing, license and collaboration agreements represents contractual obligations related to manufacturing our product candidates for use in our clinical trials and for commercial operations in the case of ADCETRIS.\nSome of our manufacturing, license and collaboration agreements provide for periodic maintenance fees over specified time periods, as well as payments by us upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones. Some of our licensing agreements obligate us to pay royalties from the low single digit to mid-teens based on net sales of products utilizing licensed technology. Such royalties are dependent on future product sales and are not provided for in the table above as they are dependent on events that have not yet occurred. Future milestone payments for research and pre-clinical stage development programs have not been included in the above table as the event triggering such payment or obligation has not yet occurred. The above table also excludes up to $400.0 million in potential future milestone payments to Unum under our collaboration agreement with Unum and up to approximately $98 million in potential future milestone payments to other third parties under license agreements for our clinical-stage development programs. These milestone payments generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental, clinical, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. These contingent payments have not been included in the above table as the event triggering such payment or obligation has not yet occurred.\nWe entered into a Merger Agreement with Cascadian in January 2018, and we entered into a license and collaboration agreement and related platform technology license agreement with Pieris in February 2018. We are obligated to make payments under these agreements, and those payments have not been included in the above\ntable as these agreements were executed after December 31, 2017. For additional details about these agreements, see \u201c-Recent developments\u201d above.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nSee the section \u201cRecent accounting pronouncements\u201d in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

Our antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, technology utilizes the targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies to deliver cell-killing agents directly to cancer cells. We are commercializing ADCETRIS\u00ae, or brentuximab vedotin, for the treatment of several types of lymphomas. We are also advancing a pipeline of novel therapies for solid tumors and blood-related cancers designed to address unmet medical needs and improve treatment outcomes for patients.\nADCETRIS\u00ae (brentuximab vedotin)\nOur marketed product ADCETRIS\u00ae is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Commission for four indications, encompassing several settings for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma, for relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or sALCL, and for certain types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, or CTCL. ADCETRIS is commercially available in 70 countries, including in the United States, Canada, members of the European Union and Japan. We are collaborating with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS on a global basis. Under this collaboration, Seattle Genetics has retained commercial rights for ADCETRIS in the United States and its territories and in Canada, and Takeda has commercial rights in the rest of the world. Beyond our current labeled indications, we have a broad development strategy for ADCETRIS evaluating its therapeutic potential in earlier lines of therapy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, mature T-cell lymphoma, or MTCL, also known as peripheral T-cell lymphoma, or PTCL, including sALCL. We are also evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor, or CPI. We and our partners are currently conducting these phase 3 clinical trials of ADCETRIS, all of which are described in more detail under the heading \u201c-ADCETRIS and Lead Product Candidate Development Pipeline\u201d in Part I Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n \u2022 ECHELON-1: In collaboration with Takeda, we are investigating ADCETRIS plus AVD (adriamycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) versus ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) as frontline combination therapy in patients with previously untreated advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The ECHELON-1 trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that treatment with ADCETRIS plus AVD resulted in a statistically significant improvement in modified progression-free survival. Interim analysis \n of overall survival, the key secondary endpoint, also trended in favor of the ADCETRIS plus AVD arm. The FDA granted BTD to ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy for the frontline treatment of patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. In December 2017, the FDA granted Priority Review for the supplemental Biologics License Application, or sBLA, we submitted in November 2017 seeking approval of ADCETRIS as part of a frontline combination chemotherapy regimen in patients with previously untreated advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date is May 1, 2018. \n \u2022 ECHELON-2: In collaboration with Takeda, we are evaluating ADCETRIS in combination with CHP versus CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) for the treatment of newly-diagnosed MTCL patients. In November 2016, we and Takeda completed enrollment of 452 patients in the ECHELON-2 trial, and we expect to report top-line data in 2018. \n \u2022 CHECKMATE 812: In collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, we are evaluating the combination of BMS's immunotherapy nivolumab (Opdivo) with ADCETRIS for the treatment of relapsed or refractory, or transplant-ineligible, advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma. \nClinical-stage product candidates\nIn collaboration with Astellas Pharma, Inc., or Astellas, we are developing enfortumab vedotin, formerly known as ASG-22ME. We and Astellas are conducting a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with CPI therapy. We and Astellas also initiated a phase 1b trial of enfortumab vedotin in combination with CPI therapy for patients with first- or second-line locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.\nIn collaboration with Genmab A/S, or Genmab, we are developing tisotumab vedotin. We and Genmab plan to initiate a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cervical cancer.\nWe have a collaboration with Unum Therapeutics, Inc., or Unum, to develop and commercialize novel antibody-coupled T-cell receptor, or ACTR, therapies incorporating our antibodies for the treatment of cancer.\nOur earlier-stage clinical pipeline includes other ADC programs consisting of ladiratuzumab vedotin, denintuzumab mafodotin, SGN-CD19B, SGN-CD123A, SGN-CD33A and SGN-CD352A, as well as immuno-oncology agents, SEA-CD40, which is based on our sugar-engineered antibody, or SEA, technology, and SGN-2FF, which is a novel small molecule. In addition, we have multiple preclinical and research-stage programs that employ our proprietary technologies, including SGN-CD48A.\nWe have collaborations for our ADC technology with a number of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd., or AbbVie; Bayer Pharma AG, or Bayer; Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., or Celldex; Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, or Genentech; GlaxoSmithKline LLC, or GSK; Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer; and PSMA Development Company LLC, a subsidiary of Progenics Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Progenics.\nRecent developments\nOn January 30, 2018, we entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Cascadian Therapeutics, Inc., or Cascadian, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company based in Seattle, Washington, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Cascadian for $10.00 per share net to the seller in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes, which we estimate is approximately $614.1 million in the aggregate. Valley Acquisition Sub, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, has commenced the offer contemplated by the Merger Agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Cascadian common stock, or the Tender Offer, and as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Tender Offer, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, our wholly owned subsidiary will merge with and into Cascadian, or the Merger, and Cascadian will\nsurvive as our subsidiary. Our obligation to complete the Tender Offer and the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions. We refer to the Tender Offer and Merger together in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the Cascadian Acquisition. We expect to consummate the Cascadian Acquisition in first quarter of 2018. For additional details about the Cascadian Acquisition, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Proposed Acquisition of Cascadian Therapeutics\u201d above.\nOn February 5, 2018, we completed an underwritten public offering of 13,269,230 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $52.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to us of approximately $690.0 million, before deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use the proceeds from the recently-completed public offering to fund a portion of the costs of the Cascadian Acquisition. In addition, as a result of the net proceeds to us from the public offering exceeding $400.0 million, the senior secured bridge loan facility various banks committed to provide to us on January 30, 2018 in connection with the Cascadian Acquisition is no longer available to us in accordance with the terms of the related commitment letter.\nOn February 8, 2018, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement and related platform technology license agreement with Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Pieris Pharmaceuticals AG, or together, Pieris, to develop novel bispecifics incorporating our antibodies and Pieris' proprietary Anticalin proteins for the treatment of cancer. For additional details about this agreement, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Corporate Collaborations\u201d above.\nOutlook\nOur ongoing research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities, together with the anticipated consummation of the Cascadian Acquisition and the anticipated integration and development activities related to the acquired Cascadian business and Cascadian's product candidates, including tucatinib, will require substantial amounts of capital and may not ultimately be successful. In addition, we may encounter unexpected difficulties during our anticipated integration and development activities related to the acquired Cascadian business and Cascadian's product candidates, any of which may cause us to expend greater funds and efforts or may slow, delay or limit development progress with respect to Cascadian's product candidates that we may acquire in the Cascadian Acquisition. Over the next several years, we expect that we will incur substantial expenses, primarily as a result of activities related to the commercialization of ADCETRIS, the continued development of ADCETRIS, enfortumab vedotin, and tisotumab vedotin, and, if the Cascadian Acquisition is completed, tucatinib. Our other product candidates are in relatively early stages of development. Enfortumab vedotin, tisotumab vedotin and our other product candidates will require significant further development, financial resources and personnel to pursue and obtain regulatory approval and develop into commercially viable products, if at all. Our commitment of resources to the continuing development, regulatory and commercialization activities for ADCETRIS, the research, continued development and manufacturing of our product candidates and expansion of our pipeline, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and the anticipated integration and development activities related to the acquired Cascadian business and Cascadian's product candidates will likely require us to raise substantial amounts of additional capital and our operating expenses may fluctuate as a result of such activities. We may also incur significant milestone payment obligations to certain of our licensors as our product candidates progress through clinical trials towards potential commercialization.\nIn addition, we may be unable to complete the Cascadian Acquisition. Even if completed, the success of the Cascadian Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our business with the business of Cascadian and to advance the development of Cascadian's product candidates. For additional details on these risks, see \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Cascadian Acquisition\u201d above.\nWe recognize revenue from ADCETRIS product sales in the United States and Canada. Our future ADCETRIS product sales are difficult to accurately predict from period to period. In this regard, our product sales have varied, and may continue to vary, significantly from period to period and may be affected by a variety of factors. Such factors include the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for ADCETRIS is available\nfrom government and other third-party payers, competition, the incidence rate of new patients in ADCETRIS' approved indications, customer ordering patterns, the overall level of demand for ADCETRIS, and the duration of therapy for patients receiving ADCETRIS. In particular:\n \u2022 Obtaining and maintaining appropriate coverage and reimbursement for ADCETRIS is increasingly challenging due to, among other things, the attention being paid to healthcare cost containment and other austerity measures in the U.S. and worldwide, as well as increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to pharmaceutical drug pricing practices. We anticipate that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and an additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for ADCETRIS. We also anticipate that Congress, state legislatures, and third-party payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system, any of which could negatively affect our revenue or sales of ADCETRIS (or any future approved products). \n \u2022 The competition ADCETRIS faces from competing therapies is intensifying, and we anticipate that we will continue to face increasing competition in the future as new companies enter our market and scientific developments surrounding biosimilars and other cancer therapies continue to accelerate. \n \u2022 We believe that the level of our current ADCETRIS sales in the United States has been attributable to the incidence flow of patients eligible for treatment with ADCETRIS, which can vary significantly from period to period. Moreover, we believe that the incidence rate in ADCETRIS' approved indications is relatively low, particularly when compared to many other oncology indications. In addition, we expect only modest sales growth in the near term as a result of the November 2017 FDA approval of ADCETRIS for the treatment of patients with primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or pcALCL, and CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides, or MF, who have received prior systemic therapy, subject to our ability to effectively commercialize ADCETRIS in this indication. \nFor these and other reasons, we expect that our ability to accelerate ADCETRIS sales growth, if at all, will depend primarily on our ability to continue to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use, particularly with respect to the frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and frontline MTCL indications. Our efforts to continue to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use will continue to require additional time and investment in clinical trials to complete and may not be successful. Our ability to successfully commercialize ADCETRIS and to continue to expand its labeled indications of use are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In particular, although we reported positive top line data in our ECHELON-1 trial in June 2017, there can be no assurance that either we or Takeda will ultimately obtain regulatory approvals of ADCETRIS in the ECHELON-1 treatment setting in our respective territories, which would limit our sales of, and the commercial potential of, ADCETRIS. Likewise, we may fail to commercialize ADCETRIS in pcALCL and CD30-expressing MF patients or in the ECHELON-1 treatment setting if our sBLA that we submitted in November 2017 is approved by the FDA, either of which would limit our sales of, and the commercial potential of ADCETRIS. In addition, negative or inconclusive results in our ECHELON-2 trial would negatively impact, or preclude altogether, our and Takeda's ability to obtain regulatory approvals in the frontline MTCL indication in our respective territories, which would also limit our sales of, and the commercial potential of, ADCETRIS.\nWe also expect that amounts earned from our collaboration agreements, including royalties, will continue to be an important source of our revenues and cash flows. These revenues will be impacted by future development funding and the achievement of development, clinical and commercial success by our collaborators under our existing collaboration and license agreements, including our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda, as well as by entering into potential new collaboration and license agreements. Our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and from quarter to quarter and, as a result, we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as being indicative of our future performance.\nFinancial summary\nTotal revenues increased 15% to $482.3 million in 2017, compared to $418.1 million in 2016. This increase was primarily driven by ADCETRIS net product sales that increased 16% to $307.6 million in 2017 as compared to $265.8 million in 2016, and by collaboration and license agreement revenues that increased 28% to $108.6 million in 2017 as compared to $84.9 million in 2016. Total costs and expenses increased 21% to $678.1 million in 2017 as compared to $560.9 million in 2016. This primarily reflects increased investment in our pipeline of preclinical and clinical-stage programs, increased drug product supply to Takeda, and higher staffing costs to support our continued growth. Net losses were $125.5 million and $140.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 included a gain of $33.8 million resulting from the change in the fair value of the Immunomedics warrant derivative as discussed below, and an income tax benefit of $33.4 million related to the change in the fair value of our Immunomedics common stock investment.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $413.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, and $677.6 million in total stockholders' equity. See \u201c-Recent developments\u201d above for a discussion on the underwritten public offering that was completed in February 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nWe evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nRevenue Recognition. Our revenues are comprised of ADCETRIS net product sales, amounts earned under our collaboration and licensing agreements and royalties. Under the accounting guidance that was in effect through December 31, 2017, revenue recognition was predicated upon persuasive evidence of an agreement existing, delivery of products or services being rendered, amounts payable being fixed or determinable, and collectibility being reasonably assured.\nWe adopted the Accounting Standards Update entitled \u201cASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. For additional information, see the section \u201cRecent accounting pronouncements\u201d in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d is based on accounting guidance in effect through December 31, 2017.\nNet product sales\nWe sell ADCETRIS through a limited number of pharmaceutical distributors. Customers order ADCETRIS through these distributors and we typically ship product directly to the customer. We record product sales when title and risk of loss pass, which generally occurs upon delivery of the product to the customer. Product sales are recorded net of estimated government-mandated rebates and chargebacks, distribution fees, estimated product returns and other deductions. These are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions. Accruals are established for these deductions and actual amounts incurred are offset against applicable accruals. We reflect these accruals as either a reduction in the related account receivable from the distributor, or as an accrued liability depending on the nature of the sales deduction. Sales deductions are based on our estimates that consider payer mix in target markets and our experience to date. These estimates involve a substantial degree of judgment.\nGovernment-mandated rebates and chargebacks: We have entered into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This agreement provides for a rebate based on covered purchases of ADCETRIS. Medicaid rebates are invoiced to us by the various state Medicaid programs. We estimate Medicaid rebates based on a variety of factors, including our experience to date. We also have completed our Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, agreement under which certain U.S. government purchasers receive a discount on eligible purchases of ADCETRIS. We have entered into a Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, which enables certain entities that qualify for government pricing under the Public Health Services Act, or PHS, to receive discounts on their qualified purchases of ADCETRIS. Under these agreements, distributors process a chargeback to us for the difference between wholesale acquisition cost and the applicable discounted price. As a result of our direct-ship distribution model, we can identify the entities purchasing ADCETRIS and this information enables us to estimate expected chargebacks for FSS and PHS purchases based on each entity's eligibility for the FSS and PHS programs. We also review actual rebate and chargeback information to further refine these estimates.\nDistribution fees, product returns and other deductions: Our distributors charge a volume-based fee for distribution services that they perform for us. We allow for the return of product that is within 30 days of its expiration date or that is damaged. We estimate product returns based on our experience to date. In addition, we consider our direct-ship distribution model, our belief that product is not typically held in the distribution channel, and the expected rapid use of the product by healthcare providers. We provide financial assistance to qualifying patients that are underinsured or cannot cover the cost of commercial coinsurance amounts through SeaGen Secure. SeaGen Secure is available to patients in the U.S. and its territories who meet various financial and treatment need criteria. Estimated contributions for commercial coinsurance under SeaGen Secure are deducted from gross sales and are based on an analysis of expected plan utilization. These estimates are adjusted as necessary to reflect our actual experience.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues\nWe have collaboration and license agreements with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Our proprietary ADC technologies are the basis of many of our collaboration and license agreements, including our ADC collaborations that we have entered into in the ordinary course of our business under which we grant our collaborators research and commercial licenses to our technology and typically provide technology transfer services, technical advice, supplies and services for a period of time.\nIf there are continuing performance obligations, we use a time-based proportional performance model to recognize revenue over our performance period for the related agreement when no other discernible pattern exists. Collaboration and license agreements are evaluated to determine whether the multiple elements and associated deliverables can be considered separate units of accounting. To date, the pre-commercial deliverables under our collaboration and license agreements have not qualified as separate units of accounting. The assessment of multiple element arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate point in time, or period of time, that revenue should be recognized. We believe that the development period in each agreement is a reasonable estimate of the performance obligation period of such agreement. Accordingly, all amounts received or due, including any upfront payments, maintenance fees, development and regulatory milestone payments and reimbursement payments, are recognized as revenue over the performance obligation periods of each agreement. These performance obligation periods typically range from one to three years. The agreements with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, and Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, or Genentech, have performance obligation periods of ten and seventeen years, respectively. All of the remaining performance obligation periods for our active collaborations are currently expected to be completed in three years or less. When no performance obligations are required of us, or following the completion of the performance obligation period, such amounts are recognized as revenue when collectibility is reasonably assured. Generally, all amounts received or due other than sales-based milestones and royalties are classified as collaboration and license agreement revenues as they are earned. Sales-based milestones and royalties are recognized as royalty revenue as they are reported to us.\nOur collaboration and license agreements include contractual milestones. Generally, the milestone events contained in our collaboration and license agreements coincide with the progression of the collaborators' product candidates from development to regulatory approval and then to commercialization.\nDevelopment milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events:\n \u2022 Designation of a product candidate or initiation of pre-clinical studies. Our collaborators must undertake significant pre-clinical research and studies to make a determination of the suitability of a product candidate and the time from those studies or designation to initiation of a clinical trial may take several years. \n \u2022 Initiation of a phase 1 clinical trial. Generally, phase 1 clinical trials may take one to two years to complete. \n \u2022 Initiation of a phase 2 clinical trial. Generally, phase 2 clinical trials may take one to three years to complete. \n \u2022 Initiation of a phase 3 clinical trial. Generally, phase 3 clinical trials may take two to six years to complete. \nRegulatory milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events:\n \u2022 Filing of regulatory applications for marketing approval such as a BLA in the United States or a Marketing Authorization Application in Europe. Generally, it may take up to twelve months to prepare and submit regulatory filings. \n \u2022 Receiving marketing approval in a major market, such as in the United States, Europe, Japan or other significant countries. Generally it may take up to three years after a marketing application is submitted to obtain approval for marketing and pricing from the applicable regulatory agency. \nCommercialization milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events:\n \u2022 First commercial sale in a particular market, such as in the United States, Europe, Japan or other significant countries. \n \u2022 Product sales in excess of a pre-specified threshold. The amount of time to achieve this type of milestone depends on several factors, including, but not limited to, the dollar amount of the threshold, the pricing of the product, market penetration of the product and the rate at which customers begin using the product. \nOur ADC collaborators are solely responsible for the development of their product candidates and the achievement of milestones in any of the categories identified above is based solely on the collaborators' efforts.\nIn the case of our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda, we may be involved in certain development activities; however, the achievement of milestone events under the agreement is primarily based on activities undertaken by Takeda.\nThe process of successfully developing a product candidate, obtaining regulatory approval and ultimately commercializing a product candidate is highly uncertain and the attainment of any milestones is therefore uncertain and difficult to predict. In addition, since we do not take a substantive role or control the research, development or commercialization of any products generated by our ADC collaborators, we are not able to reasonably estimate when, if at all, any milestone payments or royalties may be payable to us by our ADC collaborators. As such, the milestone payments associated with our ADC collaborations involve a substantial degree of uncertainty and risk that they may never be received. Similarly, even in those collaborations where we may have an active role in the development of the product candidate, such as our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda, the attainment of a milestone is based on the collaborator's activities and is generally outside our direction and control.\nWe generally invoice our collaborators and licensees on a monthly or quarterly basis, or upon the completion of the effort or achievement of a milestone, based on the terms of each agreement. Any deferred revenue arising from amounts received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process is recognized as revenue in future periods when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nRoyalty revenues and cost of royalty revenues\nRoyalty revenues primarily reflect amounts earned under the ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda. These royalties include commercial sales-based milestones and sales royalties. Sales royalties are based on a percentage of Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS, with rates that range from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties depending on sales volumes and reset annually. Takeda bears a portion of third-party royalty costs owed on its sales of ADCETRIS. These amounts are included in our royalty revenues. Cost of royalty revenues reflect amounts owed to our third-party licensors related to Takeda's sales of ADCETRIS. These amounts are recognized in the quarter in which Takeda reports its sales activity to us, which is the quarter following the related sales. Royalty revenues also include certain amounts earned in connection with our ADC collaborations.\nInvestments. We have investments in debt and equity securities. We classify our investments as available-for-sale, which are reported at estimated fair value with the changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income and loss in stockholders' equity. Upon our adoption of the Accounting Standards Update entitled \u201cASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments: Overall\u201d on January 1, 2018, we are required to record changes in the fair value of equity securities in net income or loss. The fair value of our investments is subject to volatility and could adversely affect our future operating results.\nAccrued Liabilities. As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued liabilities. This process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for such services where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. We record these estimates in our consolidated financial statements as of each balance sheet date. Examples of estimated accrued liabilities include amounts due to contract research organizations and other costs in conjunction with clinical trials, amounts due in conjunction with manufacturing ADCETRIS and our product candidates, third-party royalties that accrue on our sales of ADCETRIS and professional service fees, among other items.\nIn accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period. If the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. In the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services, our actual liabilities would differ from such estimates. The date on which some services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations. We make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with GAAP.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist of salaries, benefits and other headcount-related costs of our research and development staff, preclinical activities, clinical trials and related manufacturing costs, lab supplies, contract and outside service fees, and facilities and overhead expenses. Research and development activities are expensed as incurred.\nClinical trial expenses are a significant component of research and development expenses, and we outsource a significant portion of these costs to third parties. Third-party clinical trial expenses include investigator fees, site costs, clinical research organization costs, and costs for central laboratory testing and data management. Costs associated with activities performed under research and development co-development collaborations are reflected in research and development expense. In-licensing fees, milestones, maintenance fees, and other costs to acquire technologies utilized in research and development for product candidates that have not yet received regulatory approval and that are not expected to have alternative future use are expensed when incurred.\nNon-refundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed.\nShare-based Compensation. Share-based compensation cost is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of options on the date of grant which requires certain estimates to be made by management, including the expected forfeiture rate and expected term of the options. We also make decisions regarding the method of calculating the expected stock price volatility and the risk free interest rate used in the model. Fluctuations that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost. We recognize this estimated fair value over the vesting period of the arrangement using the graded-vesting attribution method for stock options which vest ratably over the vesting period. For performance-based stock options, we recognized this estimated fair value over the service period of the award when we believe vesting of the performance-based stock options is considered probable. Once vesting of performance-based stock options is considered probable, we record compensation expense based on the portion of the service period elapsed to date, with a cumulative catch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize remaining compensation expense, if any, over the remaining estimated service period.\nThe fair value of each restricted stock unit, or RSU, equals the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. RSUs granted to date vest 100% at a single point in time. We therefore amortize the value of RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award.\nLong-term Incentive Plans. We have long term incentive plans which provide eligible employees with the opportunity to receive performance-based incentive compensation, which may be comprised of cash, stock options, and/or restricted stock units. The payment of cash and the grant or vesting of equity are contingent upon the achievement of pre-determined regulatory milestones. We record compensation expense over the estimated service period for each milestone when we believe the milestone is considered probable, which we assess at each reporting date. Once a milestone is considered probable, we record compensation expense based on the portion of the service period elapsed to date with respect to that milestone, with a cumulative catch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize any remaining compensation expense, if any, over the remaining estimated service period.\nIncome Taxes. We have net deferred tax assets which are fully offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We believe that a full valuation allowance is appropriate as we have a history of net operating losses. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made, a portion of which would increase income (or decrease losses) in the period in which such a determination was made. We follow the guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the recognition of an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority.\nInventories. We consider regulatory approval of product candidates to be uncertain. Accordingly, we charge manufacturing costs to research and development expense until such time as a product has received regulatory approval for commercial sale. We began capitalizing ADCETRIS production costs into inventory following its accelerated approval by the FDA in 2011. ADCETRIS inventory that is deployed into clinical, research or development use is charged to research and development expense when it is no longer available for commercial sales. Production costs for our other product candidates continue to be charged to research and development expense.\nWe value our inventories at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined on a specific identification basis. Inventory includes the cost of materials, third-party contract manufacturing and overhead associated with the production of ADCETRIS. We would write-down inventory cost to net realizable value if we were to determine that we had any excess, obsolete or unsalable inventory.\nLoss Contingencies. We are involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of our business. A loss contingency is recorded if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, among other factors, the probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the ultimate loss. Loss contingencies that we determine to be reasonably possible, but not probable, are disclosed but not recorded. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Legal fees incurred as a result of our involvement in legal proceedings are expensed as incurred.\nResults of Operations-Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and\nNet product sales\nWe sell ADCETRIS in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nNet product sales increased in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior years primarily due to an increase in sales volume and, to a lesser extent, price increases. The increases in sales volumes in both periods were driven primarily by increased use of ADCETRIS across multiple lines of therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma and for the treatment of other malignancies.\nIn November 2017, the FDA approved ADCETRIS for the treatment of adult patients with pcALCL and CD30-expressing MF who have received prior systemic therapy. While we expect continued growth in ADCETRIS sales in 2018 as compared to 2017, we expect only modest sales growth in the near term as a result of the FDA approval of ADCETRIS for the treatment of patients with pcALCL and CD30-expressing MF who have received prior systemic therapy, subject to our ability to effectively commercialize ADCETRIS in this indication. Our ability to accelerate the rate of ADCETRIS sales growth in future periods, if at all, will be primarily dependent on our ability to continue to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use. Our efforts to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use will continue to require additional time and investment in clinical trials to complete and may not be successful.\nWe record product sales net of estimated government-mandated rebates and chargebacks, distribution fees, product returns and other deductions. These are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions. Gross-to-net deductions, net of related payments and credits, were as follows:\n\nMandatory government discounts are the most significant component of our total gross-to-net deductions and the discount percentage has been increasing. These discount percentages increased during 2017 and 2016 as\na result of price increases we instituted that exceeded the rate of inflation, and to a lesser extent in 2017, as a result of an increase in the proportion of our sales eligible for government mandated rebates or chargebacks. Generally, the change in government prices is limited to the rate of inflation. Distribution fees, product returns and other gross-to-net deductions were relatively stable as a percentage of our gross sales during 2017, 2016 and 2015. We expect future gross-to-net deductions to fluctuate based on the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates, as well as changes in the discount percentage which is impacted by potential future price increases, the rate of inflation, and other factors.\nAs a result of price increases and a continued increase in the percentage of our gross sales that are eligible for government mandated rebates and chargebacks, we expect gross-to-net deductions to increase in 2018 as compared to 2017. There has been extensive discussion in the United States about expanding government discount programs, including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, and pressure on pharmaceutical drug pricing is increasing. For example, the Bipartisan Budget Act, which was enacted on February 9, 2018, contains measures targeting the cost of drugs under federal health care programs, including, among others, an increase from 50% to 70% in the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D, effective January 1, 2019. Further, the Trump administration's budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains additional drug pricing initiatives that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, a measure to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid. If government discount programs are expanded or discounts are increased as a result of changes in regulations in the United States, our gross-to-net deductions will increase and our net sales will be negatively impacted.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues reflect amounts earned under product, ADC and co-development collaborations. These revenues reflect the earned portion of payments received by us for technology access and maintenance fees, milestone payments and reimbursement payments for research and development support that we provide to our collaborators. Collaboration and license agreement revenues by collaborator were as follows:\n\nCollaboration revenues from Takeda fluctuate based on changes in the earned portion of reimbursement funding under the ADCETRIS collaboration, which are influenced by the activities each party is performing under the collaboration agreement at a given time. For example, when Takeda's level of spending on clinical collaboration activities increases above our own, our earned portion of reimbursement funding generally decreases. Additionally, we receive reimbursement for the cost of drug product supplied to Takeda for its use, the timing of which fluctuates based on Takeda's product supply needs. The earned portion of reimbursement funding fluctuates based upon how much drug product Takeda has purchased from us in a given period.\nCollaboration revenues from Takeda increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in drug product supply activities to Takeda. The increase in collaboration revenues from Takeda in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily reflected a decrease in clinical trial costs related to activity performed by Takeda as the ECHELON-1 and other studies advanced and an increase in drug product supply activities to Takeda.\nThe decrease in revenues from AbbVie in 2017 as compared to 2016 reflected the timing differences of development milestones and licensing fees as well as a decrease in the earned portion of milestone payments\nachieved in prior years. Revenues from AbbVie decreased in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to a decrease in the earned portion of milestone payments achieved in prior years.\nChanges in revenues recognized from our other collaboration agreements, which include our ADC collaborations and our co-development collaborations, reflected the timing and the earned portion of development milestones and licensing fees.\nOur collaboration and license agreement revenues are impacted by the term and duration of those agreements and by progress-dependent milestones, annual maintenance fees and reimbursement of materials and support services. Collaboration and license agreement revenues may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the progress made by our collaborators with their product candidates, the level of support we provide to our collaborators, specifically to Takeda under our ADCETRIS collaboration, the timing of milestones achieved and our ability to enter into additional collaborations. We expect our collaboration and license agreement revenues in 2018 to be lower than 2017, driven by the lower expected volume of drug to be supplied to Takeda. We have a significant balance of deferred revenue, representing prior payments from our collaborators that have not yet been recognized as revenue. This deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue in future periods using a time-based approach as we fulfill our performance obligations.\nCollaboration Agreements\nTakeda\nOur ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda provides for the global co-development of ADCETRIS and the commercialization of ADCETRIS by Takeda in its territory. We received an upfront payment and have received and are entitled to receive progress- and sales-dependent milestone payments based on Takeda's achievement of significant events under the collaboration, in addition to tiered royalties with percentages ranging from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties based on net sales of ADCETRIS within Takeda's licensed territories. Additionally, the companies equally co-fund the cost of selected development activities conducted under the collaboration. We recognize as collaboration revenue the upfront payment, progress-dependent development and regulatory milestone payments, and net development cost reimbursement payments from Takeda over the ten-year development period of the collaboration, which began in 2009. When the performance of development activities under the collaboration results in us making a reimbursement payment to Takeda, the effect is to reduce the amount of collaboration revenue that we record. We also receive reimbursement for the cost of drug product supplied to Takeda for its use and, in some cases, pay Takeda for drug product they supply to us. The earned portion of net collaboration payments is reflected in collaboration and license agreement revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2017, total future potential milestone payments to us under the ADCETRIS collaboration could total approximately $165 million. Of the remaining amount, up to approximately $7 million relates to the achievement of development milestones, up to approximately $118 million relates to the achievement of regulatory milestones and up to approximately $40 million relates to the achievement of commercial milestones. As of December 31, 2017, $70 million in milestones had been achieved as a result of regulatory and commercial progress by Takeda.\nAstellas\nWe have an agreement with Agensys, which subsequently became an affiliate of Astellas, to jointly research, develop and commercialize ADCs for the treatment of several types of cancer. The collaboration encompasses combinations of our ADC technology with fully-human antibodies developed by Astellas to proprietary cancer targets.\nUnder this collaboration, we and Astellas are co-funding all development and commercialization costs for enfortumab vedotin and will share equally in any profits that may come from this product candidate if successfully commercialized. Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense.\nGenmab\nWe have an agreement with Genmab for the development and commercialization of ADCs for the treatment of several types of cancer.\nUnder this agreement, we exercised a co-development option for tisotumab vedotin in August 2017. We and Genmab will share all future costs and profits for development and commercialization of tisotumab vedotin on an equal basis. Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense. We will be responsible for tisotumab vedotin commercialization activities in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, while Genmab will be responsible for commercialization activities in all other territories. Each party has the option to co-promote up to a specified percentage of the sales effort in the other party's territories.\nUnum Therapeutics\nWe have a collaboration agreement with Unum to develop and commercialize novel ACTR therapies for cancer. We and Unum are developing two ACTR product candidates that combine Unum's ACTR technology with our antibodies. Unum is conducting preclinical research and clinical development activities through phase 1 clinical trials, and we are providing funding for these activities. The agreement calls for us to work together to co-develop and jointly fund programs after phase 1 clinical trials unless either company opts out. Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense.\nWe and Unum would co-commercialize any successfully developed product candidates and share any profits equally on any co-developed programs in the United States. We retain exclusive commercial rights outside of the United States, paying Unum a royalty that is a high single digit to mid-teens percentage of ex-U.S. sales. The potential future licensing and progress-dependent milestone payments to Unum under the collaboration may total up to $400 million between the two ACTR programs, payment of which is triggered by the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones.\nADC Collaboration Agreements\nWe have other active collaborations with a number of companies to allow them to use our proprietary ADC technology. Under these ADC collaborations, which we have entered into in the ordinary course of business, we typically receive or are entitled to receive upfront cash payments, progress- and sales-dependent milestones and royalties on net sales of products incorporating our ADC technology, as well as annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and materials provided under the agreements. These amounts are recognized as revenue as they are realized, or over the performance obligation period of the agreements during which we provide limited support to the collaborator. Our ADC collaborators are solely responsible for research, product development, manufacturing and commercialization of any product candidates under these collaborations, which includes achievement of the potential milestones.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our ADC collaborations had generated more than $375 million, primarily in the form of upfront and milestone payments. Total milestone payments to us under our current ADC collaborations could total up to approximately $2.9 billion if all potential product candidates achieved all of their milestone events. Of this amount, approximately $0.4 billion relates to the achievement of development milestones, approximately $1.1 billion relates to the achievement of regulatory milestones and approximately $1.4 billion relates to the achievement of commercial milestones. Since we do not control the research, development or commercialization of any of the products that would generate these milestones, we are not able to reasonably estimate when, if at all, any milestone payments or royalties may be payable by our collaborators. Successfully developing a product candidate, obtaining regulatory approval and ultimately commercializing it is a significantly lengthy and highly uncertain process which entails a significant risk of failure. In addition, business combinations, changes in a collaborator's business strategy and financial difficulties or other factors could result and have resulted in a collaborator abandoning or delaying development of its product candidates. As such, the milestone payments associated with our ADC collaborations and co-development agreements involve a\nsubstantial degree of risk and may never be received. Accordingly, we do not expect, and investors should not assume, that we will receive all of the potential milestone payments described above, and it is possible that we may never receive any significant milestone payments under these agreements.\nRoyalty revenues and cost of royalty revenues\nRoyalty revenues primarily reflect royalties paid to us by Takeda under the ADCETRIS collaboration. These royalties include commercial sales-based milestones and sales royalties. The royalty rate paid by Takeda is calculated as a percentage of Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS, ranges from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties depending on sales volumes, and resets annually. Takeda bears a portion of third-party royalty costs owed on sales of ADCETRIS in its territory. This amount is included in our royalty revenues. Cost of royalty revenues reflect amounts owed to our third-party licensors related to the sale of ADCETRIS in Takeda's territory.\n\nRoyalty revenues decreased in 2017 as compared to 2016, as 2016 included a one-time $20.0 million sales-based milestone triggered by Takeda. This decrease was partially offset by Takeda's higher sales volume and higher royalty rate in 2017. Royalty revenues increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to the one-time $20.0 million sales-based milestone triggered by Takeda, as well as Takeda's higher sales volume in 2016.\nCost of royalty revenues fluctuates based on the amount of net sales of ADCETRIS by Takeda in its territories.\nWe expect that royalty revenues will increase in 2018, as compared to 2017, primarily due to higher sales volume by Takeda. We expect cost of royalty revenues to increase in 2018 primarily due to anticipated increases in sales volumes in Takeda's territory and, to a lesser extent, increases in the applicable royalty rate.\nCost of sales\nADCETRIS cost of sales includes manufacturing costs of product sold, third-party royalty costs, amortization of technology license costs, and distribution and other costs.\n\nCost of sales increased in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods, primarily due to higher third-party royalty costs that were driven by increased sales volumes. We expect cost of sales to increase in 2018, primarily due to anticipated increases in sales volumes.\nResearch and development\n\nResearch expenses include, among other things, personnel, occupancy and laboratory expenses, technology access fees associated with the discovery and identification of new monoclonal antibodies and related technologies, and the development of novel classes of stable linkers and cell-killing agents for our ADC technology. Research expenses also include research activities associated with our product candidates, such as preclinical translational biology and in vitro and in vivo studies, and IND-enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily reflected increases in both internal and co-development costs to support our growing pipeline of product candidates and, to a lesser extent, increases in staffing and related occupancy costs. The decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily the result of a $25.0 million technology access fee related to the initiation of our collaboration agreement with Unum in June of 2015, offset partially by increased staffing, facilities and other costs to support our growing pipeline of product candidates, as well as increases in technology access fees paid and cost reimbursements to Unum under our collaboration agreement.\nDevelopment and contract manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses, external contract manufacturing costs for the scale-up and pre-approval manufacturing of drug product used in research and our clinical trials, and costs for drug product supplied to our collaborators. Development and contract manufacturing expenses also include quality control and assurance activities, and storage and shipment of our product candidates. The increases in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods primarily reflected increased drug product supplied to Takeda and, to a lesser extent, increases in staffing and other costs to support our growing pipeline of product candidates. The increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 also included cost reimbursements to Astellas under our collaboration.\nClinical expenses include personnel, travel, occupancy costs, and external clinical trial costs including costs for clinical sites, clinical research organizations, contractors and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials. The increases in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods reflected increased clinical trial activity related to our product candidates, primarily enfortumab vedotin and ladiratuzumab vedotin, and related increases in personnel costs, offset in part by a decline in SGN-CD33A costs.\nWe utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development projects. We track human resource efforts expended on many of our programs for purposes of billing our collaborators for time incurred at agreed upon rates and for resource planning. We do not account for actual costs on a project basis as it relates to our infrastructure, facility, employee and other indirect costs; however, we do separately track significant third-party costs including clinical trial costs, manufacturing costs and other contracted service costs on a project basis. To that end, the following table shows third-party costs incurred for research, contract manufacturing of our product candidates and clinical and regulatory services, as well as pre-commercial milestone payments for in-licensed technology for ADCETRIS and certain of our clinical-stage product candidates. The table also presents other costs and overhead consisting of third-party costs for our preclinical stage programs, personnel, facilities and other indirect costs not directly charged to development programs.\n\nThird-party costs for ADCETRIS increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in drug product supplied to Takeda, offset partially by a decrease in clinical trial activities. Third-party costs for ADCETRIS increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in drug product supplied to Takeda and, to a lesser extent, third-party clinical trial costs as we evaluated the use of ADCETRIS in other lines of therapy. The cost of drug product supplied to Takeda is charged to research and development expense. We are reimbursed for the drug product, which is included in collaboration and license agreement revenues.\nThird-party costs for SGN-CD33A decreased in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to the discontinuation of our phase 3 CASCADE and other SGN-CD33A clinical trials. Third-party costs for SGN-CD33A increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to increases in clinical trial costs and drug supply activities for then ongoing and anticipated additional clinical trials. At this time, we have no plans to initiate additional clinical trials of SGN-CD33A.\nThird-party costs for enfortumab vedotin and ladiratuzumab vedotin increased in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods primarily due to increases in drug supply activities and, to a lesser extent, clinical trial costs as we initiated additional clinical trials in 2017.\nThird-party costs for our other clinical stage programs were related to multiple earlier-stage development programs and were relatively consistent across 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nOther costs and overhead include third-party costs of our preclinical programs, including our strategic collaborations with Genmab and Unum, and costs associated with personnel and facilities. These costs increased\nin 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods due to increased development activities to expand our product pipeline, including increases in staffing levels and the expansion of our facilities to accommodate our growth.\nOur expenditures on our ADCETRIS clinical development program and on our current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion. In order to advance our product candidates toward commercialization, the product candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety, toxicology and efficacy studies. We then conduct clinical trials for those product candidates that take several years or more to complete. The length of time varies substantially based upon the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. Likewise, in order to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use, we are required to conduct additional extensive clinical trials. The cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n \u2022 the number of patients required in our clinical trials; \n \u2022 the length of time required to enroll trial participants; \n \u2022 the number and location of sites included in the trials; \n \u2022 the costs of producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions; \n \u2022 the safety and efficacy profile of the product candidate; \n \u2022 the use of clinical research organizations to assist with the management of the trials; and \n \u2022 the costs and timing of, and the ability to secure, regulatory approvals. \nWe anticipate that our total research and development expenses in 2018 will increase compared to 2017 due primarily to higher costs for the development of our product candidates, primarily enfortumab vedotin and ladiratuzumab vedotin, as well as the operation of the biologics manufacturing facility that we acquired in October 2017 and Cascadian research and development activities, if the Cascadian Acquisition closes. Certain ADCETRIS development activities, including some clinical studies, will be conducted by Takeda, the costs of which are not reflected in our research and development expenses. Because of these and other factors, expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors, including the degree of collaborative activities, timing of manufacturing campaigns, numbers of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial event.\nThe risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of ADCETRIS in any additional approved indications or of any of our product candidates.\nSelling, general and administrative\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior periods primarily due to higher costs for staffing to support our continued growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to higher expenses for legal matters.\nWe anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in 2018 as we continue our activities in support of the commercialization of ADCETRIS, as well as our support of general operations and Cascadian selling, general and administrative activities, if the Cascadian Acquisition closes.\nInvestment and other income, net\n\nN/A: No amount in comparable period or not a meaningful comparison.\nThe net gain on Immunomedics warrant derivative primarily was due to the increase in the fair value of the warrant derivative prior to it being exercised in December 2017. We acquired the warrant in February 2017 and received 8.7 million shares of Immunomedics common stock upon exercise in December 2017. The resulting shares of common stock are classified as available-for-sale securities and carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income and loss in stockholders' equity. The fair value of the Immunomedics common stock fluctuates based on changes in the stock price of Immunomedics. Upon our adoption of the Accounting Standards Update entitled \u201cASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments: Overall\u201d on January 1, 2018, we will record changes in the fair value of equity securities in net income or loss. To the extent that we continue to hold Immunomedics common stock or other equity securities, our operating results may fluctuate significantly. For additional information on our adoption of this ASU, see the section \u201cRecent accounting pronouncements\u201d in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment income reflects amounts earned on our investments in U.S. Treasury securities. Investment income increased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a higher effective yield of our portfolio. Investment income increased in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to higher average investment balances following our public offering in September 2015, which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $526.6 million.\nIncome taxes\n\nN/A: No amount in comparable period or not a meaningful comparison.\nThe income tax benefit was due to unrealized gains on our common stock investment in Immunomedics, which was offset by an income tax provision for the same amount in other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity.\nLiquidity and capital resources\n\n\nThe changes in net cash from operating activities primarily are related to our net loss, working capital fluctuations and changes in our non-cash expenses, all of which are highly variable. The changes in cash from investing activities reflect differences between the proceeds received from sale and maturity of our investments and amounts reinvested, and for 2017 included $55.1 million paid for the Immunomedics common stock investment (as part of purchases of available-for-sale securities) and $41.7 million paid for the acquisition of a biologics manufacturing facility in October 2017. Cash from financing activities includes proceeds from stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan for all years presented, and for 2015 included $526.6 million in net proceeds from our public offering in September 2015.\nWe primarily have financed our operations through the issuance of equity securities, collections from commercial sales of ADCETRIS, and amounts received pursuant to product collaborations and our ADC collaborations. To a lesser degree, we have also financed our operations through royalty revenues and interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. These financing and revenue sources have allowed us to maintain adequate levels of cash and investments. See \u201c-Recent developments\u201d above for a discussion on the Cascadian Acquisition, as well as the underwritten public offering that was completed in February 2018.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and investments are held in a variety of non-interest bearing bank accounts and interest-bearing instruments subject to investment guidelines allowing for holdings in U.S. government and agency securities, corporate securities, taxable municipal bonds, commercial paper and money market accounts. Our investment portfolio is structured to provide for investment maturities and access to cash to fund our anticipated working capital needs. However, if our liquidity needs should be accelerated for any reason in the near term, or investments do not pay at maturity, we may be required to sell investment securities in our portfolio prior to their scheduled maturities, which may result in a loss. As of December 31, 2017, we had $413.2 million held in cash or investments scheduled to mature within the next twelve months.\nAt our currently planned spending rates, we believe that our financial resources, including the proceeds from our February 2018 public offering of common stock, together with product and royalty revenues from sales of ADCETRIS and the fees, milestone payments and reimbursements we expect to receive under our existing collaboration and license agreements, will be sufficient to fund the costs of the Cascadian Acquisition and to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. Changes in our spending rate may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner, such as increased development, manufacturing and clinical trial expenses in connection with our expanding pipeline programs, and the Cascadian Acquisition, our undertaking of additional programs, business activities, or entry into additional strategic transactions, including potential additional acquisitions of products, technologies or businesses.\nAccordingly, we may be required to, or may otherwise determine to, raise additional capital to fund those obligations. Further, in the event of a termination of the ADCETRIS collaboration agreement with Takeda, we would not receive development cost sharing payments or milestone payments or royalties for the development or sale of ADCETRIS in Takeda's territory, and we would be required to fund all ADCETRIS development and commercial activities. Any of these factors could lead to a need for us to raise additional capital.\nWe expect to make additional capital outlays and to increase operating expenditures over the next several years as we hire additional employees, support our preclinical development, manufacturing and clinical trial activities for ADCETRIS and our other pipeline programs, and expand internationally, as well as commercialize ADCETRIS and position ADCETRIS for potential additional regulatory approvals. In addition, we anticipate\ncommitting substantial capital resources to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the anticipated integration and development activities related to the acquired Cascadian business and Cascadian's product candidates, including tucatinib. Our commitment of resources to the continuing development, regulatory and commercialization activities for ADCETRIS, and the research, continued development and manufacturing of our product candidates will likely require us to raise substantial amounts of additional capital. Further, we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including licensing or otherwise acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses, and we may require significant additional capital in order to complete or otherwise provide funding for any additional acquisitions. We may seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods: corporate collaborations, licensing arrangements and public or private debt or equity financings. We do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will obtain financing on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs, which may adversely affect our business and operations.\nCommitments\nThe following table reflects our future minimum contractual commitments as of December 31, 2017:\n\nWe have entered into leases for our office and laboratory facilities expiring in 2018 through 2024 that contain rate escalations and options for us to extend the leases. Operating lease obligations in the table above do not assume the exercise by us of any extension options.\nManufacturing, license and collaboration agreement commitments include non-cancelable obligations under our manufacturing, license and collaboration agreements. A substantial portion of the minimum payments under manufacturing, license and collaboration agreements represents contractual obligations related to manufacturing our product candidates for use in our clinical trials and for commercial operations in the case of ADCETRIS.\nSome of our manufacturing, license and collaboration agreements provide for periodic maintenance fees over specified time periods, as well as payments by us upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones. Some of our licensing agreements obligate us to pay royalties from the low single digit to mid-teens based on net sales of products utilizing licensed technology. Such royalties are dependent on future product sales and are not provided for in the table above as they are dependent on events that have not yet occurred. Future milestone payments for research and pre-clinical stage development programs have not been included in the above table as the event triggering such payment or obligation has not yet occurred. The above table also excludes up to $400.0 million in potential future milestone payments to Unum under our collaboration agreement with Unum and up to approximately $98 million in potential future milestone payments to other third parties under license agreements for our clinical-stage development programs. These milestone payments generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental, clinical, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. These contingent payments have not been included in the above table as the event triggering such payment or obligation has not yet occurred.\nWe entered into a Merger Agreement with Cascadian in January 2018, and we entered into a license and collaboration agreement and related platform technology license agreement with Pieris in February 2018. We are obligated to make payments under these agreements, and those payments have not been included in the above\ntable as these agreements were executed after December 31, 2017. For additional details about these agreements, see \u201c-Recent developments\u201d above.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nSee the section \u201cRecent accounting pronouncements\u201d in Note 2 to
