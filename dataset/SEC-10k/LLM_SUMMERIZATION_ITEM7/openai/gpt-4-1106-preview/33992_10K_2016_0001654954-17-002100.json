MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nWe offer property and casualty insurance products to individuals and small businesses in New York State through our wholly owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company ( KICO\u201d). KICO's insureds are located primarily in downstate New York, consisting of New York City, Long Island and Westchester County. We are also licensed in the States of New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Texas. In October 2016, a homeowners rate, rule, and form filing was approved for use by the State of New Jersey. We anticipate writing business there in the first half of 2017.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from KICO, which includes revenues from earned premiums, ceding commissions from quota share reinsurance, net investment income generated from its portfolio, and net realized gains and losses on investment securities. All of KICO's insurance policies are for a one year period. Earned premiums represent premiums received from insureds, which are recognized as revenue over the period of time that insurance coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the one year life of the policy). A significant period of time normally elapses between the receipt of insurance premiums and the payment of insurance claims. During this time, KICO invests the premiums, earns investment income and generates net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on investments.\nOur expenses include the insurance underwriting expenses of KICO and other operating expenses. Insurance companies incur a significant amount of their total expenses from losses incurred by policyholders, which are commonly referred to as claims. In settling these claims, various loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) are incurred such as insurance adjusters' fees and legal expenses. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition costs. Policy acquisition costs include commissions paid to producers, premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including employees' compensation and benefits.\nOther operating expenses include our corporate expenses as a holding company. These expenses include legal and auditing fees, executive employment costs, and other costs directly associated with being a public company.\nPrincipal Revenue and Expense Items\nNet premiums earned. Net premiums earned is the earned portion of our written premiums, less that portion of premium that is ceded to third party reinsurers under reinsurance agreements. The amount ceded under these reinsurance agreements is based on a contractual formula contained in the individual reinsurance agreement. Insurance premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the policy. At the end of each reporting period, premiums written that are not earned are classified as unearned premiums and are earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. Our insurance policies have a term of one year. Accordingly, for a one-year policy written on July 1, 2016, we would earn half of the premiums in 2016 and the other half in 2017.\nCeding commission revenue. Commissions on reinsurance premiums ceded are earned in a manner consistent with the recognition of the direct acquisition costs of the underlying insurance policies, generally on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured.\nNet investment income and net realized gains (losses) on investments. We invest in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, fixed-maturity and equity securities. Our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets, less investment expenses. Net realized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income. Net realized gains occur when our investment securities are sold for more than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable. Net realized losses occur when our investment securities are sold for less than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable, or are written down as a result of other-than-temporary impairment. We classify equity securities as available-for-sale and our fixed-maturity securities as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Net unrealized gains (losses) on those securities classified as available-for-sale are reported separately within accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet.\nOther income. We recognize installment fee income and fees charged to reinstate a policy after it has been cancelled for non-payment. Through March 31, 2015, we also recognized premium finance fee income on loans financed by a third party finance company.\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses incurred. Loss and LAE incurred represent our largest expense item, and for any given reporting period include estimates of future claim payments, changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating, defending and servicing claims. These expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure. We record loss and LAE related to estimates of future claim payments based on case-by-case valuations, statistical analyses and actuarial procedures. We seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate liability based on our historical claims experience. It is typical for certain claims to take several years to settle and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information on such claims. Our ability to estimate loss and LAE accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor affecting our profitability.\nCommission expenses and other underwriting expenses. Other underwriting expenses include policy acquisition costs and other expenses related to the underwriting of policies. Policy acquisition costs represent the costs of originating new insurance policies that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of insurance policies (principally commissions, premium taxes and certain underwriting salaries). Policy acquisition costs are deferred and recognized as expense as the related premiums are earned. Other underwriting expenses represent general and administrative expenses of our insurance business and are comprised of other costs associated with our insurance activities such as regulatory fees, telecommunication and technology costs, occupancy costs, employment costs, and legal and auditing fees.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses include the corporate expenses of our holding company, Kingstone Companies, Inc. These expenses include executive employment costs, legal and auditing fees, and other costs directly associated with being a public company.\nStock-based compensation. Non-cash equity compensation includes the fair value of stock grants issued to our directors, officers and employees, and amortization of stock options issued to the same.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization includes the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of KICO, depreciation of the real estate used in KICO's operations, as well as depreciation of capital expenditures for information technology projects, office equipment and furniture.\nIncome tax expense. We incur federal income tax expense on our consolidated operations as well as state income tax expense for our non-insurance underwriting subsidiaries.\nProduct Lines\nOur product lines include the following:\nPersonal lines: Our largest line of business is personal lines, consisting of homeowners, dwelling fire, 3-4 family dwelling package, cooperative and condominium, renters, equipment breakdown and service line endorsements, and personal umbrella policies.\nCommercial liability: We offer businessowners policies, which consist primarily of small business retail, service, and office risks without a residential exposure. We also write artisan's liability policies for small independent contractors with seven or fewer employees. In addition, we write special multi-peril policies for larger and more specialized businessowners' risks, including those with limited residential exposures. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we began offering commercial umbrella policies written above our supporting commercial lines policies.\nCommercial automobile: Until recently we provided liability and physical damage coverage for light commercial vehicles. However, due to the poor performance of this line, effective October 1, 2014, we decided to no longer accept new commercial auto policies. In February 2015, we decided to no longer offer renewals to our existing commercial auto policies beginning with those that expired on or after May 1, 2015. As of April 30, 2016 we had no commercial auto policies in force and we have 34 open claims remaining as of December 31, 2016.\nLivery physical damage: We write for-hire vehicle physical damage only policies for livery and car service vehicles and taxicabs. These policies insure only the physical damage portion of insurance for such vehicles, with no liability coverage included.\nOther: We write canine legal liability policies and also have a small participation in mandatory state joint underwriting associations.\nKey Measures\nWe utilize the following key measures in analyzing the results of our insurance underwriting business:\nNet loss ratio: The net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company's business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of net losses and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) incurred to net premiums earned.\nNet underwriting expense ratio: The net underwriting expense ratio is a measure of an insurance company's operational efficiency in administering its business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of the sum of acquisition costs (the most significant being commissions paid to our producers) and other underwriting expenses less ceding commission revenue less other income to net premiums earned.\nNet combined ratio: The net combined ratio is a measure of an insurance company's overall underwriting profit. This is the sum of the net loss and net underwriting expense ratios. If the net combined ratio is at or above 100 percent, an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income, and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\nUnderwriting income: Underwriting income is net pre-tax income attributable to our insurance underwriting business before investment activity. It excludes net investment income, net realized gains from investments, and depreciation and amortization (net premiums earned less expenses included in combined ratio). Underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company's overall operating profitability before items such as investment income, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and income taxes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone Companies, Inc. and all majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, our management has utilized information including our past history, industry standards, and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by our management in formulating estimates inherent in these financial statements might not materialize. However, application of the critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nWe believe that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for loss and LAE, including losses that have occurred but have not been reported prior to the reporting date, amounts recoverable from third party reinsurers, deferred ceding commission revenue, deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred income taxes, the impairment of investment securities, intangible assets and the valuation of stock-based compensation. See Note 2 (Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements following Item 15 of this Annual Report.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the results of our operations for the periods indicated:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct written premiums\n</td> <td> $103,192\n</td> <td> $91,004\n</td> <td> $12,188\n</td> <td> 13.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assumed written premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12)\n</td> <td> (29.3) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 103,221\n</td> <td> 91,045\n</td> <td> 12,176\n</td> <td> 13.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceded written premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceded to quota share treaties in force during the period\n</td> <td> 26,377\n</td> <td> 28,701\n</td> <td> (2,324)\n</td> <td> (8.1) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return of premiums previously ceded to prior quota share treaties (1)\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> (5,866)\n</td> <td> 5,866\n</td> <td> (100.0) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceded to quota share treaties\n</td> <td> 26,377\n</td> <td> 22,835\n</td> <td> 3,542\n</td> <td> 15.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceded to excess of loss treaties\n</td> <td> 1,389\n</td> <td> 1,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceded to catastrophe treaties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 1 - June 30 (Net basis in 2016, Gross basis in 2015) (2)\n</td> <td> 4,575\n</td> <td> 2,079\n</td> <td> 2,496\n</td> <td> 120.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> July 1 - December 31 (Net basis in 2016 and 2015) (2)\n</td> <td> 4,954\n</td> <td> 4,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total ceded to catastrophe treaties\n</td> <td> 9,529\n</td> <td> 6,548\n</td> <td> 2,981\n</td> <td> 45.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total ceded written premiums\n</td> <td> 37,295\n</td> <td> 30,660\n</td> <td> 6,635\n</td> <td> 21.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net written premiums\n</td> <td> 65,926\n</td> <td> 60,385\n</td> <td> 5,541\n</td> <td> 9.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in unearned premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct and assumed\n</td> <td> (6,104)\n</td> <td> (8,433)\n</td> <td> 2,329\n</td> <td> (27.6) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceded to quota share treaties (1)\n</td> <td> 1,586\n</td> <td> (3,340)\n</td> <td> 4,926\n</td> <td> (147.5) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in net unearned premiums\n</td> <td> (4,518)\n</td> <td> (11,773)\n</td> <td> 7,255\n</td> <td> (61.6) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premiums earned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct and assumed\n</td> <td> 97,116\n</td> <td> 82,613\n</td> <td> 14,503\n</td> <td> 17.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceded to quota share treaties (1)\n</td> <td> (35,708)\n</td> <td> (34,001)\n</td> <td> (1,707)\n</td> <td> 5.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net premiums earned\n</td> <td> 61,408\n</td> <td> 48,612\n</td> <td> 12,796\n</td> <td> 26.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceding commission revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Excluding the effect of catastrophes\n</td> <td> 11,268\n</td> <td> 12,754\n</td> <td> (1,486)\n</td> <td> (11.7) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of catastrophes (3)\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> (1,281)\n</td> <td> 1,281\n</td> <td> (100.0) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total ceding commission revenue\n</td> <td> 11,268\n</td> <td> 11,473\n</td> <td> (205)\n</td> <td> (1.8) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td> 3,116\n</td> <td> 2,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gain (loss) on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,158.0) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> 1,115\n</td> <td> 1,577\n</td> <td> (462)\n</td> <td> (29.3) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> 77,436\n</td> <td> 64,176\n</td> <td> 13,260\n</td> <td> 20.7%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Effective July 1, 2015, we decreased the quota share ceding rate in our personal lines quota share treaty from 55% to 40% (the Cut-off\u201d). The Cut-off on July 1, 2015 resulted in a $5,866,000 return of unearned premiums from our reinsurers that were previously ceded under the personal lines quota share treaty that expired on June 30, 2015. The $5,866,000 return of premiums previously ceded reduced earned premiums under our quota share, which, in turn, increased our net premiums earned during the twelve month period after the Cut-off.\n(2) Under a gross\u201d basis catastrophe reinsurance treaty, catastrophe reinsurance coverage is purchased by us only on the net written premiums after the quota share. Under a gross\u201d basis, catastrophe losses affect the ceded loss ratio and contingent ceding commissions from quota share reinsurance. Under a net\u201d basis catastrophe reinsurance treaty, all catastrophe reinsurance coverage is purchased by us directly, eliminating the impact of a catastrophe on quota share results. The net\u201d basis increases our ceded premium for catastrophe reinsurance.

Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds, excessive rain, winter storms, severe winter weather, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, and hurricanes.\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage Point Change\n</td> <td>\nPercent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nKey ratios:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss ratio\n</td> <td> 45.3%\n</td> <td> 47.7%\n</td> <td> (2.4)\n</td> <td> (5.0) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td> 33.9%\n</td> <td> 32.3%\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td> 5.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net combined ratio\n</td> <td> 79.2%\n</td> <td> 80.0%\n</td> <td> (0.8)\n</td> <td> (1.0) %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDirect Written Premiums\nDirect written premiums during the year ended December 31, 2016 ( 2016\u201d) were $103,192,000 compared to $91,004,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 ( 2015\u201d). The increase of $12,188,000, or 13.4%, was primarily due to an increase in policies in-force during 2016 as compared to 2015. We wrote more new policies as a result of continued demand for our products in the markets that we serve. Policies in-force increased by 11.7% as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nOur growth rate in direct written premiums was dampened somewhat due to the: (1) slowing of growth in our livery physical damage line of business, and (2) suspension, effective October 1, 2014, of the writing of new policies in our commercial auto line of business due to a history of poor underwriting results. In February 2015, we made the decision to no longer offer renewals on our existing commercial auto policies beginning with those that expired on or after May 1, 2015. Our direct written premiums in our continuing lines of business grew by 14.0% in 2016 compared to 2015. Policies-in-force in our continuing lines of business increased by 12.0% as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nNet Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned\nThe following table details the quota share reinsurance ceding rates in effect during 2016 and 2015. For purposes of the discussion herein, the change in quota share ceding rates on July 1 of each year will be referred to as the Cut-off\u201d. This table should be referred to in conjunction with the discussions for net written premiums, net premiums earned, ceding commission revenue and net loss and loss adjustment expenses that follow.\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJanuary 1,\n</td> <td>\nJuly 1,\n</td> <td>\nJanuary 1,\n</td> <td>\nJuly 1,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto\n</td> <td>\nto\n</td> <td>\nto\n</td> <td>\nto\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJune 30,\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\nJune 30,\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(\"2015/2016 Treaty\")\n</td> <td>\n(\"2016/2017 Treaty\")\n</td> <td>\n(\"2014/2015 Treaty\")\n</td> <td>\n(\"2015/2016 Treaty\")\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQuota share reinsurance rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal lines\n</td> <td> 40%\n</td> <td> 40%\n</td> <td> 55%\n</td> <td> 40%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Reinsurance\u201d below for changes to our personal lines quota share treaty effective July 1, 2016.\nNet written premiums increased $5,541,000, or 9.2%, to $65,926,000 in 2016 from $60,385,000 in 2015. Net written premiums include direct and assumed premiums, less the amount of written premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties (quota share, excess of loss, and catastrophe). Our personal lines business is currently subject to a quota share treaty. A reduction to the quota share percentage or elimination of a quota share treaty will reduce our ceded written premiums, which will result in a corresponding increase to our net written premiums.\nChange in quota share ceding rate\nEffective July 1, 2015, we decreased the quota share ceding rate in our personal lines quota share treaty from 55% to 40%. The Cut-off of this treaty on July 1, 2015 resulted in a $5,866,000 return of unearned premiums from our reinsurers that were previously ceded under the expiring personal lines quota share treaty. We did not change our quota share ceding rates on July 1, 2016, and accordingly, there was no return of unearned premiums from our reinsurers (in contrast with what occurred on July 1, 2015), thus diminishing the increase in net written premiums in 2016. The table below shows the effect of the $5,866,000 return of ceded premiums on net written premiums for 2015:\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net written premiums\n</td> <td> $65,926\n</td> <td> $60,385\n</td> <td> $5,541\n</td> <td> 9.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return of premiums previously ceded to prior quota share treaties\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> 5,866\n</td> <td> (5,866)\n</td> <td>\nna\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net written premiums without the effect of the July 1, 2015 Cut-off\n</td> <td> $65,926\n</td> <td> $54,519\n</td> <td> $11,407\n</td> <td> 20.9%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWithout the $5,866,000 effect of the Cut-off in 2015, net written premiums increased by $11,407,000, or 20.9%, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nThe 2016/2017 Treaty and 2015/2016 Treaty are on a net\u201d of catastrophe reinsurance basis, as opposed to the gross\u201d arrangement that existed in periods before July 1, 2015.\nChange in catastrophe reinsurance from gross\u201d basis to net\u201d basis\nMost of the premiums written under our personal lines are also subject to our catastrophe treaty. An increase in our personal lines business gives rise to more property exposure, which increases our exposure to catastrophe risk; therefore, our premiums for catastrophe insurance will increase. This results in an increase in premiums ceded under our catastrophe treaty, which reduces net written premiums. With the inception of our personal lines quota share treaty being on a net\u201d basis effective July 1, 2015, our catastrophe premiums are paid based on all of our direct written premiums subject to the quota share, compared to catastrophe premiums being paid only on the amount of written premiums that we retained under the gross\u201d basis that expired on June 30, 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, catastrophe reinsurance was on a net\u201d basis. For the year ended December 31, 2015, catastrophe reinsurance was on a gross\u201d basis through June 30, 2015, and on a net\u201d basis from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. As a result of the 2015 mid-year change from gross\u201d to net\u201d, comparison between periods in 2016 and 2015 are separated between the six month periods ended June 30 and the six month periods ended December 31. Ceded catastrophe premiums from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016 increased by $2,496,000, or 120.1%, to $4,575,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $2,079,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due the change from gross\u201d to net\u201d. Ceded catastrophe premiums from July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 increased by $485,000, or 10.9%, to $4,954,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2016 from $4,469,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in premiums subject to catastrophe reinsurance.\nExcess of loss reinsurance treaty\nIn general, barring reductions in rates charged for reinsurance, an increase in written premiums will also increase the premiums ceded under our excess of loss treaties. This will incrementally reduce our net written premiums. In 2016, our ceded premiums related to excess of loss reinsurance treaties increased by $112,000 over the ceded premiums for 2015.\nNet premiums earned\nNet premiums earned increased $12,796,000, or 26.3%, to $61,408,000 in 2016 from $48,612,000 in 2015. The increase was primarily due to us retaining more earned premiums effective July 1, 2015, as a result of the reduction of the quota share percentage in our personal lines quota share treaty. The decrease in our quota share ceding percentage from the July 1, 2015 Cut-off gave us a $5,866,000 return of premiums previously ceded, which increased our net premiums earned during the twelve month periods after the Cut-off. In addition, as premiums written earn ratably over a twelve month period, net premiums earned in 2016 increased due to the higher net written premiums generated for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 compared to the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015.\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe following table details the quota share provisional ceding commission rates in effect during 2016 and 2015. This table should be referred to in conjunction with the discussion for ceding commission revenue that follows.\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJanuary 1,\nto\nJune 30,\n</td> <td>\nJuly 1,\nto\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\nJanuary 1,\nto\nJune 30,\n</td> <td>\nJuly 1,\nto\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(\"2015/2016 Treaty\")\n</td> <td>\n(\"2016/2017 Treaty\")\n</td> <td>\n(\"2014/2015 Treaty\")\n</td> <td>\n(\"2015/2016 Treaty\")\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQuota share previsional ceding commission rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal lines\n</td> <td> 55%\n</td> <td> 52%\n</td> <td> 40%\n</td> <td> 55%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of ceding commission revenue (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provisional ceding commissions earned\n</td> <td> $12,769\n</td> <td> $11,692\n</td> <td> $1,077\n</td> <td> 9.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingent ceding commissions earned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingent ceding commissions earned excluding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> the effect of catastrophes\n</td> <td> (1,501)\n</td> <td> 1,062\n</td> <td> (2,563)\n</td> <td> (241.3)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of catastrophes on ceding commissions earned\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> (1,281)\n</td> <td> 1,281\n</td> <td> (100.0)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingent ceding commissions earned\n</td> <td> (1,501)\n</td> <td> (219)\n</td> <td> (1,282)\n</td> <td> 585.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total ceding commission revenue\n</td> <td> $11,268\n</td> <td> $11,473\n</td> <td> $(205)\n</td> <td> (1.8) %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCeding commission revenue was $11,268,000 in 2016 compared to $11,473,000 in 2015. The decrease of $205,000, or 1.8%, was due to a decrease in contingent ceding commissions earned, partially offset by an increase in provisional ceding commissions earned.\nProvisional Ceding Commissions Earned\nWe receive a provisional ceding commission based on ceded written premiums. In 2016 our provisional ceding rate was 55% from January 1 through June 30 under the 2015/2016 Treaty and was reduced to 52% effective July 1, 2016 under the 2016/2017 Treaty. In 2015 our provisional ceding rate was 40% from January 1 through June 30 under the 2014/2015 Treaty and was increased to 55% effective July 1, 2015 under the 2015/2016 Treaty. The variations in the ceding commission rate resulted in weighted average rates during 2016 and 2015 of 53.5% and 47.5%, respectively.\nThe $1,077,000 increase in provisional ceding commissions earned is due to: (1) an increase in personal lines direct written premiums subject to the quota share and (2) an increase in the weighted average provisional ceding commission rates as discussed above, partially offset by (1) a decrease in the amount of premiums subject to provisional ceding commissions due to the reduction in quota share rates to 40% beginning July 1, 2015 and (2) a decrease in the percentage of ceded premiums subject to quota share under the net\u201d quota share treaties in effect beginning July 1, 2015 compared to the gross\u201d 2014/2015 Treaty that expired on June 30, 2015.\nContingent Ceding Commissions Earned\nAs a result of the increase in the provisional ceding commission rates to 52% under the 2016/2017 Treaty and 55% under the 2015/2016 Treaty beginning July 1, 2015, from 40% under the 2014/2015 Treaty, we do not have an opportunity to earn as much contingent ceding commissions. Under the net\u201d treaty in effect as of July 1, 2015, catastrophe losses in excess of the $4,000,000 retention will fall outside of the quota share treaty and such losses will not have an impact on contingent ceding commissions, as was the case under previous gross\u201d treaties. The new net\u201d structure eliminates the adverse impact that catastrophe losses can have on contingent ceding commissions.\nWe receive a contingent ceding commission based on a sliding scale in relation to the losses incurred under our quota share treaties. The lower the ceded loss ratio, the more contingent commission we receive. The amount of contingent ceding commissions we are eligible to receive under the personal lines quota share treaties detailed in the table above that were in effect during 2016 are subject to change based on losses incurred from claims with accident dates beginning July 1, 2015. The amount of contingent ceding commissions we are eligible to receive under our prior years' quota share treaties is subject to change based on losses incurred related to claims with accident dates before July 1, 2015 under those treaties.\nIn 2015, in addition to the 2015/2016 Treaty, which was effective as of July 1, 2015, our personal lines reinsurance quota share treaty that expired on June 30, 2015 covered the period from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2015 ( 2013/2015 Treaty\u201d). The computation to arrive at contingent ceding commission revenue under the 2013/2015 Treaty included catastrophe losses and LAE incurred from severe winter weather during 2015 (see discussion of Net Loss and LAE\u201d below). Such losses increased our ceded loss ratio in our 2013/2015 Treaty, which reduced our contingent ceding commission revenue in accordance with the sliding scale discussed above in 2015 by $1,281,000. Catastrophe losses for 2016 have no impact on our contingent ceding commission revenue since the ultimate loss ratio used to determine these commissions was not affected by the 2016 severe winter weather. See Reinsurance\u201d below for changes to our personal lines quota share treaty effective July 1, 2016.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income was $3,116,000 in 2016 compared to $2,564,000 in 2015. The increase of $552,000, or 21.5%, was due to an increase in average invested assets in 2016. The increase in cash and invested assets resulted primarily from increased operating cash flows for the period after June 30, 2015. The increase in operating cash flows is due in part from the reduction in quota share rates on July 1, 2015. The reduction in quota share rates results in a decline in ceded premiums, which leads to more cash flow and more invested funds. The pre-tax equivalent investment yield on estimated annual income, excluding cash, was 4.26% and 4.77% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the pre-tax equivalent investment yield is due to a shift toward shorter duration investments, which inherently have a lower yield. A reduction in interest rates resulted in an increase to unrealized gains on our portfolio, which in turn reduced the pre-tax equivalent investment yield.\nOther Income\nOther income was $1,115,000 in 2016 compared to $1,577,000 in 2015. The decrease of $462,000, or 29.3%, was primarily due to: (1) the $350,000 we received in 2015 as early settlement of the termination agreement that generated placement fees in our premium finance business (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (2) $154,000 we earned in 2015 in connection with the settlement of a liability, partially offset by an increase in installment and finance fees earned in our insurance underwriting business.\nNet Loss and LAE\nNet loss and LAE was $27,789,000 in 2016 compared to $23,180,000 in 2015. The net loss ratio was 45.3% in 2016 compared to 47.7% in 2015, a decrease of 2.4 percentage points.\nThe following graphs summarize the changes in the components of net loss ratio for the periods indicated:\nDuring 2016, the net loss ratio decreased compared to 2015 due to a combination of several factors. First, there was a reduction in the impact of severe winter weather, defined as the losses incurred above those expected in an average winter. In 2016 we recorded 2.3 points of impact from severe winter weather, compared to 4.3 points in 2015, or a decrease of 2.0 points. In addition, the core loss ratio excluding the impact of severe winter weather and prior year development decreased to 43.1% in 2016 from 44.4% in 2015, or a decrease of 1.3 points. Partially offsetting these declines, we recorded 0.1 points of favorable prior year loss development in 2016 compared to 1.0 point of favorable prior year development in 2015, or a decrease in the favorable impact of 0.9 points year-over-year. The decrease in the core net loss ratio is driven by reduced claim frequency in both our personal and commercial lines business. See table below under Additional Financial Information\u201d summarizing net loss ratios by line of business.\nCommercial Auto Line of Business\nEffective October 1, 2014 we decided to no longer accept applications for new commercial auto coverage. The action was taken following a series of underwriting and pricing measures which were intended to improve the profitability of this line of business. The actions taken did not yield the hoped for results. In February 2015, we decided to no longer offer renewals to our existing commercial auto policies beginning with those that expired on or after May 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we had no commercial auto policies in force, compared to 134 policies in force as of December 31, 2015.\nThe decision to exit this line of business has significantly reduced the adverse impact that associated commercial auto liability claims will have on our overall results. The following table displays the impact that this decision has had on our loss and LAE reserves over time:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommercial Auto\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommercial Auto as a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAs of\n</td> <td>\nNumber of Open Claims\n</td> <td>\nLoss and LAE Reserves\n</td> <td>\nTotal Loss and LAE Reserves\n</td> <td>\nPercentage of Total Loss and LAE Reserves\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands except number of open claims)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $9,185\n</td> <td> $34,503\n</td> <td> 26.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $8,126\n</td> <td> $39,613\n</td> <td> 20.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $4,971\n</td> <td> $39,877\n</td> <td> 12.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $2,434\n</td> <td> $41,737\n</td> <td> 5.8%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommercial auto liability loss and LAE reserves account for a rapidly decreasing percentage of our total loss and LAE reserves, and as of December 31, 2016 comprise 5.8% of our total loss and LAE reserves. This line of business was historically subject to a high level of uncertainty and volatility in claim emergence and loss development. The exit from this line therefore significantly decreases the uncertainty surrounding our overall reserve levels and reduces the associated volatility in financial results.\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense was $18,327,000 in 2016 or 18.9 % of direct earned premiums. Commission expense was $15,317,000 in 2015 or 18.6% of direct earned premiums. The increase of $3,010,000 is due to the increase in direct written premiums in 2016 as compared to 2015 and an increase in bonus commissions as a result of the decrease in net loss ratio in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in the percentage of commission expense to direct earned premiums to 18.9% in 2016 from 18.6% in 2015 is due the additional bonus commission described above and a change in the mix of business to lines of business with higher commission rates.\nOther Underwriting Expenses\nOther underwriting expenses were $14,867,000 in 2016 compared to $12,833,000 in 2015. The increase of $2,034,000, or 15.8%, in other underwriting expenses was primarily due to expenses directly and indirectly related to growth in direct written premiums. We are also incurring expenses related to our efforts to expand into the other states in which we recently obtained licensing ( Expansion Expenses\u201d). Expenses directly related to the increase in direct written premiums primarily consist of underwriting expenses, software usage fees and state premium taxes. Expenses indirectly related to the increase in direct written premiums primarily consist of salaries along with related other employment costs. Expansion Expenses include salaries and employment costs, professional fees, IT and data services. Salaries and employment costs were $7,036,000 in 2016 compared to $5,857,000 in 2015. The increase of $1,179,000, or 20.1%, was due to hiring of additional staff to service our current level of business and anticipated growth in volume. In addition, there were annual rate increases in both salaries and the cost of employee benefits. Other underwriting expenses as a percentage of direct written premiums increased to 14.4% in 2016 from 14.1% in 2015. Other underwriting expenses as a percentage of direct earned premiums decreased to 15.3% in 2016 from 15.5% in 2015. Salaries and employment costs, which accounted for 47.3% of other underwriting expenses in 2016, and 45.6% of other underwriting expenses in 2015, were 7.2% of direct earned premiums in 2016 and 7.1% of direct earned premiums in 2015.\nOur net underwriting expense ratio in 2016 was 33.9% compared with 32.3% in 2015. The following table shows the individual components of our net underwriting expense ratio for the periods indicated:\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPoint Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceding commission revenue - provisional\n</td> <td> (20.8)%\n</td> <td> (24.1)%\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceding commission revenue - contingent\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> (1.8)\n</td> <td> (2.0)\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquistion costs and other underwriting expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commission expense\n</td> <td> 29.9\n</td> <td> 31.5\n</td> <td> (1.6)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other underwriting expenses\n</td> <td> 24.2\n</td> <td> 26.4\n</td> <td> (2.2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td> 33.9%\n</td> <td> 32.3%\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase of 1.6 percentage points was due to the individual components of provisional ceding commission revenue, commission expense and other underwriting expenses and their relation to the increase in net premiums earned as a result of the additional retention resulting from the Cut-off to our quota share treaties on July 1, 2015. The increase to the net underwriting expense ratio was impacted more by reductions in the reinsurance ceding commission revenue components than it was to changes in the acquisition costs and other underwriting expense components.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses, related to the expenses of our holding company, were $1,910,000 in 2016 compared to $1,504,000 in 2015. The increase in 2016 of $406,000, or 27.0%, was primarily due to an increase in executive bonus compensation.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $1,125,000 in 2016 compared to $1,032,000 in 2015. The increase of $93,000, or 9.0%, in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to depreciation on newly purchased assets used to upgrade our systems infrastructure and the Kingston, New York home office building from which we operate.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense in 2016 was $4,518,000, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 33.7%. Income tax expense in 2015 was $3,349,000, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 32.5%. Income before taxes was $13,418,000 in 2016 compared to $10,309,000 in 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate by 1.2 percentage points in 2016 is primarily a result of permanent tax true ups from 2015.\nNet Income\nNet income was $8,900,000 in 2016 compared to $6,960,000 in 2015. The increase in net income of $1,940,000, or 27.9%, was due to the circumstances described above that caused the increase in our net premiums earned, net investment income, and a decrease in our net loss ratio, partially offset by a decrease in ceding commission revenue and other income, and by increases in other underwriting expenses related to premium growth and other operating expenses.\nAdditional Financial Information\nWe operate our business as one segment, property and casualty insurance. Within this segment, we offer a wide array of property and casualty policies to our producers. The following table summarizes gross and net premiums written, net premiums earned, and loss and loss adjustment expenses by major product type, which were determined based primarily on similar economic characteristics and risks of loss.\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross written premiums:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal lines\n</td> <td> $79,256,251\n</td> <td> $69,227,233\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial lines\n</td> <td> 12,759,351\n</td> <td> 12,010,892\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial auto(2)\n</td> <td> (5,023)\n</td> <td> 519,920\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Livery physical damage\n</td> <td> 10,955,785\n</td> <td> 9,032,957\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other(3)\n</td> <td> 254,153\n</td> <td> 253,937\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $103,220,517\n</td> <td> $91,044,939\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net written premiums:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Excluding the effect of quota share adjustments on July 1\n</td> <td> $43,485,866\n</td> <td> $33,899,714\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return of premiums previously ceded to prior quota share treaties\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> 5,866,300\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal lines(1)\n</td> <td> 43,485,866\n</td> <td> 39,766,014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial lines\n</td> <td> 11,413,717\n</td> <td> 10,922,649\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial auto(2)\n</td> <td> (110,311)\n</td> <td> 471,135\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Livery physical damage\n</td> <td> 10,955,785\n</td> <td> 9,032,957\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other(3)\n</td> <td> 181,130\n</td> <td> 192,023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $65,926,187\n</td> <td> $60,384,778\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net premiums earned:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal lines(1)\n</td> <td> $40,325,585\n</td> <td> $29,498,110\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial lines\n</td> <td> 11,120,890\n</td> <td> 10,133,600\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial auto(2)\n</td> <td> (10,567)\n</td> <td> 1,722,381\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Livery physical damage\n</td> <td> 9,783,792\n</td> <td> 7,082,843\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other(3)\n</td> <td> 188,206\n</td> <td> 175,148\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $61,407,906\n</td> <td> $48,612,082\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss and loss adjustment expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal lines\n</td> <td> $16,116,325\n</td> <td> $12,513,907\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial lines\n</td> <td> 5,408,168\n</td> <td> 5,931,699\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial auto(2)\n</td> <td> (553,450)\n</td> <td> 653,898\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Livery physical damage\n</td> <td> 4,777,308\n</td> <td> 2,444,555\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other(3)\n</td> <td> 249,046\n</td> <td> 147,789\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td> 1,792,264\n</td> <td> 1,488,152\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $27,789,661\n</td> <td> $23,180,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss ratio:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal lines\n</td> <td> 40.0%\n</td> <td> 42.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial lines\n</td> <td> 48.6%\n</td> <td> 58.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial auto(2)\n</td> <td> na\n</td> <td> 38.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Livery physical damage\n</td> <td> 48.8%\n</td> <td> 34.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other(3)\n</td> <td> 132.3%\n</td> <td> 84.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> 45.3%\n</td> <td> 47.7%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________________\n(1) See discussions above for Net Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned, related to change in quota share ceding rate and change in catastrophe reinsurance from gross\u201d basis to net\u201d basis.\n(2) Effective October 1, 2014 we decided to no longer accept applications for new commercial auto coverage.

disclosed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with respect to Fair Value Measurements,\u201d we define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a transaction involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities between market participants (an exit price\u201d). The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources ( observable inputs\u201d) and a reporting entity's internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external market data is limited or unavailable ( unobservable inputs\u201d). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes fair value measurements into three levels based on the nature of the inputs. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets have the highest priority ( Level 1\u201d), followed by observable inputs other than quoted prices including prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities ( Level 2\u201d), and unobservable inputs, including the reporting entity's estimates of the assumption that market participants would use, having the lowest priority ( Level 3\u201d). As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 65% and 66%, respectively, of the investment portfolio recorded at fair value was priced based upon quoted market prices.\nAs more fully described in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Investments-Impairment Review,\u201d we completed a detailed review of all our securities in a continuous loss position as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016 our held-to-maturity debt securities included an investment in one bond issued by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ( PR\u201d). In July 2016, PR defaulted on its interest payment to bondholders. Due to the credit deterioration of PR, we recorded a credit loss component of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) on this investment as of June 30, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the full amount of the write-down was recognized as a credit component of OTTI in the amount of $69,911 and is included as a reduction to net realized gains in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. We concluded that the other unrealized losses in these asset classes are temporary in nature and the result of a decrease in value due to technical spread widening and broader market sentiment, rather than fundamental collateral deterioration.\nThe table below summarizes the gross unrealized losses of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale and equity securities by length of time the security has continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess

at December 31, 2016 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss, none of which were deemed by us to be other than temporarily impaired. There were 57 securities at December 31, 2015 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss, none of which were deemed by us to be other than temporarily impaired. Significant factors influencing our determination that unrealized losses were temporary included the magnitude of the unrealized losses in relation to each security's cost, the nature of the investment and management's intent not to sell these securities and it being not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these investments before anticipated recovery of fair value to our cost basis.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe primary sources of cash flow are from our insurance underwriting subsidiary, KICO, and include direct premiums written, ceding commissions from our quota share reinsurers, loss recovery payments from our reinsurers, investment income and proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments. Funds are used by KICO for ceded premium payments to reinsurers, which are paid on a net basis after subtracting losses paid on reinsured claims and reinsurance commissions. KICO also uses funds for loss payments and loss adjustment expenses on our net business, commissions to producers, salaries and other underwriting expenses as well as to purchase investments and fixed assets.\nIn April 2016 we sold 595,238 newly issued shares of our common stock to RenaissanceRe Ventures Ltd., a subsidiary of RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:RNR) ( RenaissanceRe\u201d), in a private placement. RenaissanceRe is a global provider of catastrophe and specialty reinsurance and insurance. The new common shares were sold to RenaissanceRe at a price of $8.40 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $4,808,000 from the private placement. In June 2016, we invested $3,000,000 of the proceeds in KICO as additional surplus to support its continued growth. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds of the offering to support the continued growth of KICO, and for general corporate purposes.\nOn January 31, 2017, we closed on an underwritten public offering of 2,500,000 shares of our common stock. On February 14, 2017, we closed on the underwriters' 30-day purchase option for an additional 192,500 shares our common stock. The public offering price for the 2,692,500 shares sold was $12.00 per share. The aggregate net proceeds to us was approximately $30,230,000. On March 1, 2017, we used $23,000,000 of the net proceeds of the offering to contribute capital to KICO, to support its ratings upgrade plan and additional growth. The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.\nThrough December 31, 2016, the primary sources of cash flow for our holding company are dividends received from KICO, subject to statutory restrictions. For year ended December 31, 2016, KICO paid dividends of $1,950,000 to us.\nIf the aforementioned sources of cash flow currently available are insufficient to cover our holding company cash requirements, we will seek to obtain additional financing.\nOur reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operations is generally influenced by the collection of premiums in advance of paid losses, the timing of reinsurance, issuing company settlements and loss payments.\nCash flow and liquidity are categorized into three sources: (1) operating activities; (2) investing activities; and (3) financing activities, which are shown in the following table:\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> $15,201,025\n</td> <td> $20,401,907\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> (19,515,843)\n</td> <td> (14,902,052)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> 2,807,966\n</td> <td> (1,855,361)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> (1,506,852)\n</td> <td> 3,644,494\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n</td> <td> 13,551,372\n</td> <td> 9,906,878\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period\n</td> <td> $12,044,520\n</td> <td> $13,551,372\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15,201,000 in 2016 as compared to $20,402,000 provided in 2015. The $5,201,000 decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2016 was primarily a result of an increase in cash arising from net fluctuations in assets and liabilities relating to operating activities of KICO as affected by the growth in its operations which are described above, and an increase in net income (adjusted for non-cash items) of $1,485,000.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $19,516,000 in 2016 compared to $14,902,000 used in 2015. The $4,614,000 increase in cash used in investing activities is the result of a $21,097,000 increase in acquisitions of invested assets, offset by a $684,000 reduction in the amount of fixed asset acquisitions in 2016 and collection of a $250,000 note receivable included in other assets, and a $15,559,000 increase in sales or maturities of invested assets.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $2,808,000 in 2016 compared to $1,855,000 used in 2015. The $4,663,000 increase in cash provided by financing activities is the result of the $4,808,000 net proceeds we received from the private placement of our common stock in April 2016 and a $164,000 decrease in the purchase of treasury stock, offset partially by a $384,000 increase in dividends paid due an increase in the dividend rate and shares outstanding.\nReinsurance\nThe following table provides summary information with respect to each reinsurer that accounted for more than 10% of our reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRecoverable\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA.M.\n</td> <td>\nas of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\nBest Rating\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maiden Reinsurace Company\n</td> <td> A\n</td> <td> $8,625\n</td> <td> 47.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Swiss Reinsurance America Corporation\n</td> <td> A+\n</td> <td> 4,981\n</td> <td> 27.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,606\n</td> <td> 75.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Others\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,490\n</td> <td> 24.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $18,096\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReinsurance recoverable from Maiden Reinsurance Company and Motors Insurance Corporation (included in Others) are secured pursuant to collateralized trust agreements.

We attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in establishing our reserves, especially as it relates to medical and hospital rates where historical inflation rates have exceeded the general level of inflation. Inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and loss adjustment expenses to be higher than we anticipated, which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings.\nFluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates, which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new investments. Operating expenses, including salaries and benefits, generally are impacted by inflation.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, or liquidity that are material to investors.\nFactors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition\nBased upon the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. These factors, among others, may affect the accuracy of certain forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nAs a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events.\nBecause of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events (such as Superstorm Sandy), our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, severe winter weather, storms and certain types of terrorism. We have catastrophe reinsurance coverage with regard to losses of up to $252,000,000. The initial $5,000,000 of losses in a catastrophe are subject to a 40% quota share reinsurance treaty, such that we retain $3,000,000 of risk per catastrophe occurrence. With respect to any additional catastrophe losses of up to $247,000,000, we are 100% reinsured under our catastrophe reinsurance program. Catastrophe coverage is limited on an annual basis to two times the per occurrence amounts. We may incur catastrophe losses in excess of: (i) those that we project would be incurred, (ii) those that external modeling firms estimate would be incurred, (iii) the average expected level used in pricing or (iv) our current reinsurance coverage limits. Despite our catastrophe management programs, we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which may result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our financial strength ratings. In addition, the reinsurance losses that are incurred in connection with a catastrophe could have an adverse impact on the terms and conditions of future reinsurance treaties.\nIn addition, we are subject to claims arising from non-catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, severe winter weather, rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of claims when severe weather conditions occur.\nUnanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in the severity or frequency of claims may affect our profitability. Changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry, in building materials and home furnishings, and by other economic and environmental factors, including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes. Changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy and by litigation costs. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, prices of auto parts and used car prices. However, changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict, such as a change in the law or an inability to enforce exclusions and limitations contained in our policies. Although we pursue various loss management initiatives to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity, and a significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe inability to obtain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best, or a downgrade in our rating, may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, the marketability of our product offerings, and our liquidity, operating results and financial condition.\nFinancial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company's business. Many insurance buyers, agents, brokers and secured lenders use the ratings assigned by A.M. Best and other agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies with which they do business or from which they are considering purchasing insurance or in determining the financial strength of the company that provides insurance with respect to the collateral they hold. KICO currently has an A.M. Best financial strength rating of B++ (Good). A.M. Best ratings are derived from an in-depth evaluation of an insurance company's balance sheet strengths, operating performances and business profiles. A.M. Best evaluates, among other factors, the company's capitalization, underwriting leverage, financial leverage, asset leverage, capital structure, quality and appropriateness of reinsurance, adequacy of reserves, quality and diversification of assets, liquidity, profitability, spread of risk, revenue composition, market position, management, market risk and event risk. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies such as A.M. Best review the financial performance and condition of insurers and can downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer's ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurer's statutory capital, a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the insurer's control. KICO currently has a Demotech financial stability rating of A (Exceptional), which generally makes its policies acceptable to mortgage lenders that require homeowners to purchase insurance. All ratings are subject to continuous review; therefore, the retention of these ratings cannot be assured. The inability to obtain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best or a downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our competitiveness, the marketability of our product offerings and our ability to grow in the marketplace.\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms.\nThe capital and credit markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. In some cases, markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity. In the event that we need access to additional capital to support our operating expenses, make payments on any future indebtedness, pay for capital expenditures, or increase the amount of insurance that we seek to underwrite or to otherwise grow our business, our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant. Our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to our industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as lenders' perception of our long or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If a combination of these factors occurs, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms.\nWe are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and our net investment income can vary from period to period.\nWe are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, equity prices, market volatility, general economic conditions, the performance of the specific obligors included in our portfolio, and other factors outside our control. Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive instruments, such as fixed income securities, which may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates from governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. A rise in interest rates would increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio, which would be offset by our ability to earn higher rates of return on funds reinvested. Conversely, a decline in interest rates would decrease the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio, which would be offset by lower rates of return on funds reinvested.\nIn addition, market volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent. As such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. If significant, continued volatility, changes in interest rates, changes in defaults, a lack of pricing transparency, market liquidity and declines in equity prices, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, impairments, and changes in unrealized positions.\nReinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business or to obtain and maintain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best.\nOur personal lines catastrophe reinsurance program was designed, utilizing our risk management methodology, to address our exposure to catastrophes. Market conditions beyond our control impact the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be given that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as currently available. For example, our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk may be dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for its cost, and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our current reinsurance program will continue to be available in the future. If we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we will have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk, reduce our insurance writings or seek other alternatives. Our ability to obtain and maintain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best depends, in part, on our ability to purchase additional catastrophe reinsurance.\nWe intend to prudently reduce our reliance on quota share reinsurance, in part to obtain and maintain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best; this would lead to greater exposure to net insurance losses.\nWe have determined it to be in the best interests of our shareholders to prudently reduce our reliance on quota share reinsurance. Our ability to obtain and maintain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best depends, in part, on reducing the amount of premium ceded to reinsurers under our quota share reinsurance treaty. Any such reduction would result in higher earned premiums and a reduction in ceding commission revenue in future years. Such reduction would also lead to increased exposure to net insurance losses.\nReinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including changes in market conditions, whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. Since we are primarily liable to an insured for the full amount of insurance coverage, our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nApplicable insurance laws regarding the change of control of our company may impede potential acquisitions that our shareholders might consider to be desirable.\nWe are subject to statutes and regulations of the state of New York which generally require that any person or entity desiring to acquire direct or indirect control of KICO, our insurance company subsidiary, obtain prior regulatory approval. In addition, a change of control of Kingstone Companies, Inc. would require such approval. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of our company, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions. Some of our shareholders might consider such transactions to be desirable. Similar regulations may apply in other states in which we may operate.\nThe insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation that may affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business, and changes within this regulatory environment may adversely affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations. State insurance regulators are charged with protecting policyholders and have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers over our business practices. These include, among other things, the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business and the power to regulate and approve underwriting practices and rate changes, which may delay the implementation of premium rate changes or prevent us from making changes we believe are necessary to match rate to risk. In addition, many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer's ability to cancel or not renew policies and that prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business written in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by state regulatory authorities. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets.\nBecause the laws and regulations under which we operate are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, including state insurance regulators, state securities administrators and the SEC, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another's interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal and regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding he actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thereby necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and/or to improve the profitability of our business.\nWhile the United States federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry, federal legislation and administrative policies can affect us. Congress and various federal agencies periodically discuss proposals that would provide for a federal charter for insurance companies. We cannot predict whether any such laws will be enacted or the effect that such laws would have on our business. Moreover, there can be no assurance that changes will not be made to current laws, rules and regulations, or that any other laws, rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future, that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to maintain the requisite amount of risk-based capital, which may adversely affect our profitability and our ability to compete in the property and casualty insurance markets.\nThe DFS imposes risk-based capital requirements on insurance companies to ensure that insurance companies maintain appropriate levels of surplus to support their overall business operations and to protect customers against adverse developments, after taking into account default, credit, underwriting, reserve and off-balance sheet risks. If the amount of our capital falls below certain thresholds, we may face restrictions with respect to soliciting new business and/or keeping existing business. Similar regulations will apply in other states in which we may operate.\nChanging climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, profitability or cash flows.\nWe recognize the scientific view that the world is getting warmer. Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency and/or severity of weather events and affect the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance.\nOur operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business.\nThe property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. A downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nBecause substantially all of our revenue is currently derived from sources located in New York, our business may be adversely affected by conditions in such state.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently derived from sources located in the state of New York and, accordingly, is affected by the prevailing regulatory, economic, demographic, competitive and other conditions in the state. Changes in any of these conditions could make it more costly or difficult for us to conduct our business. Adverse regulatory developments in New York, which could include fundamental changes to the design or implementation of the insurance regulatory framework, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are highly dependent on a small number of insurance brokers for a large portion of our revenues.\nWe market our insurance products primarily through insurance brokers. A large percentage of our gross premiums written are sourced through a limited number of brokers. These brokers provided a total of 36.5% of our gross premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2016. The nature of our dependency on these brokers relates to the high volume of business they consistently refer to us. Our relationship with these brokers is based on the quality of the underwriting and claims services we provide to our clients and on our financial strength ratings. Any deterioration in these factors could result in these brokers advising clients to place their risks with other insurers rather than with us. A loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory action taken by the New York State Department of Financial Services following Superstorm Sandy may affect our operations and business.\nIn the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, the DFS has adopted various regulations that affect insurance companies that operate in the state of New York. Included among the regulations are accelerated claims investigation and settlement requirements and mandatory participation in non-binding mediation proceedings funded by the insurer. In settling insurance claims, including those related to Superstorm Sandy, if KICO were to pay for losses not covered by the insurance policy, such as those based on water and sewer back up claims, it could face disclaimers of coverage from its reinsurers with regard to the amounts paid.\nActual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nRecorded claim reserves for our business are based on our best estimates of losses after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances. Internal and external factors are considered. Internal factors include, but are not limited to, actual claims paid, pending levels of unpaid claims, product mix and contractual terms. External factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the law, court decisions, changes in regulatory requirements and economic conditions. Because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves, and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on the results of operations of our subsidiary KICO; there are restrictions on the payment of dividends by KICO.\nWe are a holding company and a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiary, KICO. As a holding company with limited operations of our own, currently the principal sources of our funds are dividends and other payments from KICO. Consequently, we must rely on KICO for our ability to repay debts, pay expenses and pay cash dividends to our shareholders.\nOur ability to receive dividends from KICO is restricted by the state laws and insurance regulations of New York. These restrictions are related to surplus and net investment income. Maximum permissible dividends are restricted to the lesser of 10% of surplus or 100% of net investment income (on a statutory accounting basis) for the trailing 36 months, less dividends paid by KICO during such period. As of December 31, 2016, the maximum permissible distribution that KICO could pay without prior regulatory approval was approximately $4,385,000.\nOur future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive.\nThe insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have well-established national reputations, substantially more capital and significantly greater marketing and management resources. Because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, including competition for customers, agents and brokers, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and to maintain profitable operating results or financial condition.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our ability to implement our business strategies could be delayed or hindered.\nOur future success will depend, in part, upon the efforts of Barry Goldstein, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Benjamin Walden, Executive Vice President and Chief Actuary of KICO. The loss of Mr. Goldstein, Mr. Walden or other key personnel could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategies and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we continue to grow, we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel, but we may not be able to do so. Our ability to recruit and retain such personnel will depend upon a number of factors, such as our results of operations and prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel. Mr. Goldstein is a party to an employment agreement with us that expires on December 31, 2019. Mr. Walden is not a party to an employment agreement with KICO.\nDifficult conditions in the economy generally could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs with most businesses, we believe that difficult conditions in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. General economic conditions also could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior, which may include decreased demand for our products. As consumers become more cost conscious, they may choose lower levels of insurance.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles, which are periodically revised, interpreted and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or those of one or more of our vendors.\nOur business requires that we develop and maintain computer systems to run our operations and to store a significant volume of confidential data. Some of these systems rely on third-party vendors, through either a connection to, or an integration with, those third-parties' systems. In the course of our operations, we acquire the personal confidential information of our customers and employees. We also store our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business and financial information.\nAll of these systems are subject to cyber attacks\u201d by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities, and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees, consultants, agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems. Such attacks or actions may include attempts to:\n\u25cf steal, corrupt, or destroy data, including our intellectual property, financial data or the personal information of our customers or employees\n\u25cf misappropriate funds\n\u25cf disrupt or shut down our systems\n\u25cf deny customers, agents, brokers, or others access to our systems, or\n\u25cf infect our systems with viruses or malware.\nWhile we can take defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun. Our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack. In addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen. In addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations. We have a cyber insurance policy to protect against the monetary impact of some of these risks. However, the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber-attack, if sufficiently severe, could have a material adverse effect on our business results.\nWe rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems, and the failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems. We rely on these systems to support our operations. The failure of these systems could interrupt our operations and result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, increased costs as a result of being an SEC reporting company.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as a variety of related rules implemented by the SEC, have required changes in corporate governance practices and generally increased the disclosure requirements of public companies. As a reporting company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with our public disclosure and other obligations. Based upon SEC regulations currently in effect, we are required to establish, evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. We believe that compliance with the myriad of rules and regulations applicable to reporting companies and related compliance issues will require a significant amount of time and attention from our management.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly and be highly volatile and this may make it difficult for shareholders to resell shares of our common stock at the volume, prices and times they find attractive.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations and be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for shareholders to resell shares of our common stock at the volume, prices and times they find attractive. There are many factors that will impact our stock price and trading volume, including, but not limited to, the factors listed above under Risks Related to Our Business.\u201d\nStock markets, in general, have experienced in recent years, and continue to experience, significant price and volume volatility, and the market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations that may be unrelated to our operating performance and prospects. Increased market volatility and fluctuations could result in a substantial decline in the market price of our common stock.\nThe trading volume in our common stock has been limited. As a result, shareholders may not experience liquidity in their investment in our common stock, thereby potentially limiting their ability to resell their shares at the volume, times and prices they find attractive.\nOur common stock is currently traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market. Our common stock has substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for many other publicly traded insurance and other companies. An active trading market for our common stock may not develop or, if developed, may not be sustained. Such stocks can be more volatile than stocks trading in an active public market. Therefore, shareholders have reduced liquidity and may not be able to sell their shares at the volume, prices and times that they desire.\nThere may be future issuances or resales of our common stock which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSubject to any required state insurance regulatory approvals, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock in the future, including securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock. Our issuance of additional shares of common stock in the future will dilute the ownership interests of our then existing shareholders.\nWe have effective registrations on Form S-3 under the Securities Act registering for resale an aggregate of 1,254,238 shares of our common stock and effective registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act registering an aggregate of 700,000 shares of our common stock issuable under our 2005 Equity Participation Plan and an aggregate of 700,000 shares of our common stock issuable under our 2014 Equity Participation Plan. Options to purchase 267,750 shares of our common stock are outstanding under the 2005 plan. Options to purchase 90,000 shares of our common stock are outstanding under the 2014 plan and 578,500 shares are reserved for issuance thereunder. We have also registered up to $9,290,000 of our securities pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 which we may sell from time to time in one or more offerings. The shares subject to the registration statements on Form S-3 will be freely tradeable in the public market. In addition, the shares issuable pursuant to the registration statements on Form S-8 will be freely tradable in the public market, except for shares held by affiliates.\nThe sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock, whether directly by us or selling shareholders in future offerings or by our existing shareholders in the secondary market, the perception that such issuances or resales could occur or the availability for future issuances or resale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities on attractive terms or at all.\nIn addition, our board of directors is authorized to designate and issue preferred stock without further shareholder approval, and we may issue other equity and equity-related securities that are senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, to support operations and growth, to maintain our capital ratios, and to comply with any future changes in regulatory standards.\nOur executive officers and directors own a substantial number of shares of our common stock. This will enable them to significantly influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders.\nAs of March 16, 2017, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned 1,266,659 shares of our common stock (including options to purchase 217,500 shares of our common stock), representing 11.7% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.\nAccordingly, our executive officers and directors, through their beneficial ownership of our common stock, will be able to significantly influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including the election of directors, amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, mergers or other business combination transactions and certain sales of assets outside the usual and regular course of business. The interests of our executive officers and directors may not coincide with the interests of our other shareholders, and they could take actions that advance their own interests to the detriment of our other shareholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions and the regulations to which we may be subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nWe are a holding company incorporated in Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as regulatory approvals required under state insurance laws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent shareholders from receiving a premium for their shares of common stock. Our certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors may issue up to 2,500,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, without shareholder approval and with such terms, preferences, rights and privileges as the board of directors may deem appropriate. These provisions, the control of our executive officers and directors over the election of our directors, and other factors may hinder or prevent a change in control, even if the change in control would be beneficial to, or sought by, our shareholders.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nWe offer property and casualty insurance products to individuals and small businesses in New York State through our wholly owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company ( KICO\u201d). KICO's insureds are located primarily in downstate New York, consisting of New York City, Long Island and Westchester County. We are also licensed in the States of New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Texas. In October 2016, a homeowners rate, rule, and form filing was approved for use by the State of New Jersey. We anticipate writing business there in the first half of 2017.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from KICO, which includes revenues from earned premiums, ceding commissions from quota share reinsurance, net investment income generated from its portfolio, and net realized gains and losses on investment securities. All of KICO's insurance policies are for a one year period. Earned premiums represent premiums received from insureds, which are recognized as revenue over the period of time that insurance coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the one year life of the policy). A significant period of time normally elapses between the receipt of insurance premiums and the payment of insurance claims. During this time, KICO invests the premiums, earns investment income and generates net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on investments.\nOur expenses include the insurance underwriting expenses of KICO and other operating expenses. Insurance companies incur a significant amount of their total expenses from losses incurred by policyholders, which are commonly referred to as claims. In settling these claims, various loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) are incurred such as insurance adjusters' fees and legal expenses. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition costs. Policy acquisition costs include commissions paid to producers, premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including employees' compensation and benefits.\nOther operating expenses include our corporate expenses as a holding company. These expenses include legal and auditing fees, executive employment costs, and other costs directly associated with being a public company.\nPrincipal Revenue and Expense Items\nNet premiums earned. Net premiums earned is the earned portion of our written premiums, less that portion of premium that is ceded to third party reinsurers under reinsurance agreements. The amount ceded under these reinsurance agreements is based on a contractual formula contained in the individual reinsurance agreement. Insurance premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the policy. At the end of each reporting period, premiums written that are not earned are classified as unearned premiums and are earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. Our insurance policies have a term of one year. Accordingly, for a one-year policy written on July 1, 2016, we would earn half of the premiums in 2016 and the other half in 2017.\nCeding commission revenue. Commissions on reinsurance premiums ceded are earned in a manner consistent with the recognition of the direct acquisition costs of the underlying insurance policies, generally on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured.\nNet investment income and net realized gains (losses) on investments. We invest in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, fixed-maturity and equity securities. Our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets, less investment expenses. Net realized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income. Net realized gains occur when our investment securities are sold for more than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable. Net realized losses occur when our investment securities are sold for less than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable, or are written down as a result of other-than-temporary impairment. We classify equity securities as available-for-sale and our fixed-maturity securities as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Net unrealized gains (losses) on those securities classified as available-for-sale are reported separately within accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet.\nOther income. We recognize installment fee income and fees charged to reinstate a policy after it has been cancelled for non-payment. Through March 31, 2015, we also recognized premium finance fee income on loans financed by a third party finance company.\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses incurred. Loss and LAE incurred represent our largest expense item, and for any given reporting period include estimates of future claim payments, changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating, defending and servicing claims. These expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure. We record loss and LAE related to estimates of future claim payments based on case-by-case valuations, statistical analyses and actuarial procedures. We seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate liability based on our historical claims experience. It is typical for certain claims to take several years to settle and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information on such claims. Our ability to estimate loss and LAE accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor affecting our profitability.\nCommission expenses and other underwriting expenses. Other underwriting expenses include policy acquisition costs and other expenses related to the underwriting of policies. Policy acquisition costs represent the costs of originating new insurance policies that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of insurance policies (principally commissions, premium taxes and certain underwriting salaries). Policy acquisition costs are deferred and recognized as expense as the related premiums are earned. Other underwriting expenses represent general and administrative expenses of our insurance business and are comprised of other costs associated with our insurance activities such as regulatory fees, telecommunication and technology costs, occupancy costs, employment costs, and legal and auditing fees.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses include the corporate expenses of our holding company, Kingstone Companies, Inc. These expenses include executive employment costs, legal and auditing fees, and other costs directly associated with being a public company.\nStock-based compensation. Non-cash equity compensation includes the fair value of stock grants issued to our directors, officers and employees, and amortization of stock options issued to the same.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization includes the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of KICO, depreciation of the real estate used in KICO's operations, as well as depreciation of capital expenditures for information technology projects, office equipment and furniture.\nIncome tax expense. We incur federal income tax expense on our consolidated operations as well as state income tax expense for our non-insurance underwriting subsidiaries.\nProduct Lines\nOur product lines include the following:\nPersonal lines: Our largest line of business is personal lines, consisting of homeowners, dwelling fire, 3-4 family dwelling package, cooperative and condominium, renters, equipment breakdown and service line endorsements, and personal umbrella policies.\nCommercial liability: We offer businessowners policies, which consist primarily of small business retail, service, and office risks without a residential exposure. We also write artisan's liability policies for small independent contractors with seven or fewer employees. In addition, we write special multi-peril policies for larger and more specialized businessowners' risks, including those with limited residential exposures. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we began offering commercial umbrella policies written above our supporting commercial lines policies.\nCommercial automobile: Until recently we provided liability and physical damage coverage for light commercial vehicles. However, due to the poor performance of this line, effective October 1, 2014, we decided to no longer accept new commercial auto policies. In February 2015, we decided to no longer offer renewals to our existing commercial auto policies beginning with those that expired on or after May 1, 2015. As of April 30, 2016 we had no commercial auto policies in force and we have 34 open claims remaining as of December 31, 2016.\nLivery physical damage: We write for-hire vehicle physical damage only policies for livery and car service vehicles and taxicabs. These policies insure only the physical damage portion of insurance for such vehicles, with no liability coverage included.\nOther: We write canine legal liability policies and also have a small participation in mandatory state joint underwriting associations.\nKey Measures\nWe utilize the following key measures in analyzing the results of our insurance underwriting business:\nNet loss ratio: The net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company's business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of net losses and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) incurred to net premiums earned.\nNet underwriting expense ratio: The net underwriting expense ratio is a measure of an insurance company's operational efficiency in administering its business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of the sum of acquisition costs (the most significant being commissions paid to our producers) and other underwriting expenses less ceding commission revenue less other income to net premiums earned.\nNet combined ratio: The net combined ratio is a measure of an insurance company's overall underwriting profit. This is the sum of the net loss and net underwriting expense ratios. If the net combined ratio is at or above 100 percent, an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income, and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\nUnderwriting income: Underwriting income is net pre-tax income attributable to our insurance underwriting business before investment activity. It excludes net investment income, net realized gains from investments, and depreciation and amortization (net premiums earned less expenses included in combined ratio). Underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company's overall operating profitability before items such as investment income, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and income taxes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone Companies, Inc. and all majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, our management has utilized information including our past history, industry standards, and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by our management in formulating estimates inherent in these financial statements might not materialize. However, application of the critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nWe believe that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for loss and LAE, including losses that have occurred but have not been reported prior to the reporting date, amounts recoverable from third party reinsurers, deferred ceding commission revenue, deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred income taxes, the impairment of investment securities, intangible assets and the valuation of stock-based compensation. See Note 2 (Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements following Item 15 of this Annual Report.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the results of our operations for the periods indicated:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct written premiums\n</td> <td> $103,192\n</td> <td> $91,004\n</td> <td> $12,188\n</td> <td> 13.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Assumed written premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12)\n</td> <td> (29.3) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 103,221\n</td> <td> 91,045\n</td> <td> 12,176\n</td> <td> 13.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceded written premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceded to quota share treaties in force during the period\n</td> <td> 26,377\n</td> <td> 28,701\n</td> <td> (2,324)\n</td> <td> (8.1) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return of premiums previously ceded to prior quota share treaties (1)\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> (5,866)\n</td> <td> 5,866\n</td> <td> (100.0) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceded to quota share treaties\n</td> <td> 26,377\n</td> <td> 22,835\n</td> <td> 3,542\n</td> <td> 15.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceded to excess of loss treaties\n</td> <td> 1,389\n</td> <td> 1,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceded to catastrophe treaties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 1 - June 30 (Net basis in 2016, Gross basis in 2015) (2)\n</td> <td> 4,575\n</td> <td> 2,079\n</td> <td> 2,496\n</td> <td> 120.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> July 1 - December 31 (Net basis in 2016 and 2015) (2)\n</td> <td> 4,954\n</td> <td> 4,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total ceded to catastrophe treaties\n</td> <td> 9,529\n</td> <td> 6,548\n</td> <td> 2,981\n</td> <td> 45.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total ceded written premiums\n</td> <td> 37,295\n</td> <td> 30,660\n</td> <td> 6,635\n</td> <td> 21.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net written premiums\n</td> <td> 65,926\n</td> <td> 60,385\n</td> <td> 5,541\n</td> <td> 9.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in unearned premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct and assumed\n</td> <td> (6,104)\n</td> <td> (8,433)\n</td> <td> 2,329\n</td> <td> (27.6) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceded to quota share treaties (1)\n</td> <td> 1,586\n</td> <td> (3,340)\n</td> <td> 4,926\n</td> <td> (147.5) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in net unearned premiums\n</td> <td> (4,518)\n</td> <td> (11,773)\n</td> <td> 7,255\n</td> <td> (61.6) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Premiums earned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct and assumed\n</td> <td> 97,116\n</td> <td> 82,613\n</td> <td> 14,503\n</td> <td> 17.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceded to quota share treaties (1)\n</td> <td> (35,708)\n</td> <td> (34,001)\n</td> <td> (1,707)\n</td> <td> 5.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net premiums earned\n</td> <td> 61,408\n</td> <td> 48,612\n</td> <td> 12,796\n</td> <td> 26.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceding commission revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Excluding the effect of catastrophes\n</td> <td> 11,268\n</td> <td> 12,754\n</td> <td> (1,486)\n</td> <td> (11.7) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of catastrophes (3)\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> (1,281)\n</td> <td> 1,281\n</td> <td> (100.0) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total ceding commission revenue\n</td> <td> 11,268\n</td> <td> 11,473\n</td> <td> (205)\n</td> <td> (1.8) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td> 3,116\n</td> <td> 2,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized gain (loss) on investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,158.0) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> 1,115\n</td> <td> 1,577\n</td> <td> (462)\n</td> <td> (29.3) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td> 77,436\n</td> <td> 64,176\n</td> <td> 13,260\n</td> <td> 20.7%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Effective July 1, 2015, we decreased the quota share ceding rate in our personal lines quota share treaty from 55% to 40% (the Cut-off\u201d). The Cut-off on July 1, 2015 resulted in a $5,866,000 return of unearned premiums from our reinsurers that were previously ceded under the personal lines quota share treaty that expired on June 30, 2015. The $5,866,000 return of premiums previously ceded reduced earned premiums under our quota share, which, in turn, increased our net premiums earned during the twelve month period after the Cut-off.\n(2) Under a gross\u201d basis catastrophe reinsurance treaty, catastrophe reinsurance coverage is purchased by us only on the net written premiums after the quota share. Under a gross\u201d basis, catastrophe losses affect the ceded loss ratio and contingent ceding commissions from quota share reinsurance. Under a net\u201d basis catastrophe reinsurance treaty, all catastrophe reinsurance coverage is purchased by us directly, eliminating the impact of a catastrophe on quota share results. The net\u201d basis increases our ceded premium for catastrophe reinsurance. See discussion below for Net Written Premiums, Net Premiums Earned and Contingent Ceding Commissions Earned.\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal revenues\n</td> <td> 77,436\n</td> <td> 64,176\n</td> <td> 13,260\n</td> <td> 20.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct and assumed:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes\n</td> <td> 37,249\n</td> <td> 32,962\n</td> <td> 4,287\n</td> <td> 13.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses from catastrophes (3)\n</td> <td> 2,337\n</td> <td> 4,646\n</td> <td> (2,309)\n</td> <td> (49.7) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total direct and assumed loss and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td> 39,586\n</td> <td> 37,608\n</td> <td> 1,978\n</td> <td> 5.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes\n</td> <td> 10,862\n</td> <td> 11,873\n</td> <td> (1,011)\n</td> <td> (8.5) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses from catastrophes (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,555\n</td> <td> (1,620)\n</td> <td> (63.4) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td> 11,797\n</td> <td> 14,428\n</td> <td> (2,631)\n</td> <td> (18.2) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss and loss adjustment expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss and loss adjustment expenses excluding the effect of catastrophes\n</td> <td> 26,387\n</td> <td> 21,089\n</td> <td> 5,298\n</td> <td> 25.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses from catastrophes (3)\n</td> <td> 1,402\n</td> <td> 2,091\n</td> <td> (689)\n</td> <td> (33.0) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss and loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td> 27,789\n</td> <td> 23,180\n</td> <td> 4,609\n</td> <td> 19.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commission expense\n</td> <td> 18,327\n</td> <td> 15,317\n</td> <td> 3,010\n</td> <td> 19.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other underwriting expenses\n</td> <td> 14,867\n</td> <td> 12,833\n</td> <td> 2,034\n</td> <td> 15.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td> 1,910\n</td> <td> 1,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> 1,125\n</td> <td> 1,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td> 64,018\n</td> <td> 53,867\n</td> <td> 10,152\n</td> <td> 18.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from operations before taxes\n</td> <td> 13,418\n</td> <td> 10,309\n</td> <td> 3,109\n</td> <td> 30.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income tax\n</td> <td> 4,518\n</td> <td> 3,349\n</td> <td> 1,169\n</td> <td> 34.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td> $8,900\n</td> <td> $6,960\n</td> <td> $1,940\n</td> <td> 27.9%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(3) For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, includes the effects of severe winter weather (which we define as a catastrophe).

Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds, excessive rain, winter storms, severe winter weather, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, and hurricanes.\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage Point Change\n</td> <td>\nPercent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nKey ratios:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss ratio\n</td> <td> 45.3%\n</td> <td> 47.7%\n</td> <td> (2.4)\n</td> <td> (5.0) %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td> 33.9%\n</td> <td> 32.3%\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td> 5.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net combined ratio\n</td> <td> 79.2%\n</td> <td> 80.0%\n</td> <td> (0.8)\n</td> <td> (1.0) %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDirect Written Premiums\nDirect written premiums during the year ended December 31, 2016 ( 2016\u201d) were $103,192,000 compared to $91,004,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 ( 2015\u201d). The increase of $12,188,000, or 13.4%, was primarily due to an increase in policies in-force during 2016 as compared to 2015. We wrote more new policies as a result of continued demand for our products in the markets that we serve. Policies in-force increased by 11.7% as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nOur growth rate in direct written premiums was dampened somewhat due to the: (1) slowing of growth in our livery physical damage line of business, and (2) suspension, effective October 1, 2014, of the writing of new policies in our commercial auto line of business due to a history of poor underwriting results. In February 2015, we made the decision to no longer offer renewals on our existing commercial auto policies beginning with those that expired on or after May 1, 2015. Our direct written premiums in our continuing lines of business grew by 14.0% in 2016 compared to 2015. Policies-in-force in our continuing lines of business increased by 12.0% as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nNet Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned\nThe following table details the quota share reinsurance ceding rates in effect during 2016 and 2015. For purposes of the discussion herein, the change in quota share ceding rates on July 1 of each year will be referred to as the Cut-off\u201d. This table should be referred to in conjunction with the discussions for net written premiums, net premiums earned, ceding commission revenue and net loss and loss adjustment expenses that follow.\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJanuary 1,\n</td> <td>\nJuly 1,\n</td> <td>\nJanuary 1,\n</td> <td>\nJuly 1,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nto\n</td> <td>\nto\n</td> <td>\nto\n</td> <td>\nto\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJune 30,\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\nJune 30,\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(\"2015/2016 Treaty\")\n</td> <td>\n(\"2016/2017 Treaty\")\n</td> <td>\n(\"2014/2015 Treaty\")\n</td> <td>\n(\"2015/2016 Treaty\")\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQuota share reinsurance rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal lines\n</td> <td> 40%\n</td> <td> 40%\n</td> <td> 55%\n</td> <td> 40%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Reinsurance\u201d below for changes to our personal lines quota share treaty effective July 1, 2016.\nNet written premiums increased $5,541,000, or 9.2%, to $65,926,000 in 2016 from $60,385,000 in 2015. Net written premiums include direct and assumed premiums, less the amount of written premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties (quota share, excess of loss, and catastrophe). Our personal lines business is currently subject to a quota share treaty. A reduction to the quota share percentage or elimination of a quota share treaty will reduce our ceded written premiums, which will result in a corresponding increase to our net written premiums.\nChange in quota share ceding rate\nEffective July 1, 2015, we decreased the quota share ceding rate in our personal lines quota share treaty from 55% to 40%. The Cut-off of this treaty on July 1, 2015 resulted in a $5,866,000 return of unearned premiums from our reinsurers that were previously ceded under the expiring personal lines quota share treaty. We did not change our quota share ceding rates on July 1, 2016, and accordingly, there was no return of unearned premiums from our reinsurers (in contrast with what occurred on July 1, 2015), thus diminishing the increase in net written premiums in 2016. The table below shows the effect of the $5,866,000 return of ceded premiums on net written premiums for 2015:\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net written premiums\n</td> <td> $65,926\n</td> <td> $60,385\n</td> <td> $5,541\n</td> <td> 9.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return of premiums previously ceded to prior quota share treaties\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> 5,866\n</td> <td> (5,866)\n</td> <td>\nna\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net written premiums without the effect of the July 1, 2015 Cut-off\n</td> <td> $65,926\n</td> <td> $54,519\n</td> <td> $11,407\n</td> <td> 20.9%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWithout the $5,866,000 effect of the Cut-off in 2015, net written premiums increased by $11,407,000, or 20.9%, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nThe 2016/2017 Treaty and 2015/2016 Treaty are on a net\u201d of catastrophe reinsurance basis, as opposed to the gross\u201d arrangement that existed in periods before July 1, 2015.\nChange in catastrophe reinsurance from gross\u201d basis to net\u201d basis\nMost of the premiums written under our personal lines are also subject to our catastrophe treaty. An increase in our personal lines business gives rise to more property exposure, which increases our exposure to catastrophe risk; therefore, our premiums for catastrophe insurance will increase. This results in an increase in premiums ceded under our catastrophe treaty, which reduces net written premiums. With the inception of our personal lines quota share treaty being on a net\u201d basis effective July 1, 2015, our catastrophe premiums are paid based on all of our direct written premiums subject to the quota share, compared to catastrophe premiums being paid only on the amount of written premiums that we retained under the gross\u201d basis that expired on June 30, 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, catastrophe reinsurance was on a net\u201d basis. For the year ended December 31, 2015, catastrophe reinsurance was on a gross\u201d basis through June 30, 2015, and on a net\u201d basis from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. As a result of the 2015 mid-year change from gross\u201d to net\u201d, comparison between periods in 2016 and 2015 are separated between the six month periods ended June 30 and the six month periods ended December 31. Ceded catastrophe premiums from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016 increased by $2,496,000, or 120.1%, to $4,575,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $2,079,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due the change from gross\u201d to net\u201d. Ceded catastrophe premiums from July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 increased by $485,000, or 10.9%, to $4,954,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2016 from $4,469,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in premiums subject to catastrophe reinsurance.\nExcess of loss reinsurance treaty\nIn general, barring reductions in rates charged for reinsurance, an increase in written premiums will also increase the premiums ceded under our excess of loss treaties. This will incrementally reduce our net written premiums. In 2016, our ceded premiums related to excess of loss reinsurance treaties increased by $112,000 over the ceded premiums for 2015.\nNet premiums earned\nNet premiums earned increased $12,796,000, or 26.3%, to $61,408,000 in 2016 from $48,612,000 in 2015. The increase was primarily due to us retaining more earned premiums effective July 1, 2015, as a result of the reduction of the quota share percentage in our personal lines quota share treaty. The decrease in our quota share ceding percentage from the July 1, 2015 Cut-off gave us a $5,866,000 return of premiums previously ceded, which increased our net premiums earned during the twelve month periods after the Cut-off. In addition, as premiums written earn ratably over a twelve month period, net premiums earned in 2016 increased due to the higher net written premiums generated for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 compared to the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015.\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe following table details the quota share provisional ceding commission rates in effect during 2016 and 2015. This table should be referred to in conjunction with the discussion for ceding commission revenue that follows.\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJanuary 1,\nto\nJune 30,\n</td> <td>\nJuly 1,\nto\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\nJanuary 1,\nto\nJune 30,\n</td> <td>\nJuly 1,\nto\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(\"2015/2016 Treaty\")\n</td> <td>\n(\"2016/2017 Treaty\")\n</td> <td>\n(\"2014/2015 Treaty\")\n</td> <td>\n(\"2015/2016 Treaty\")\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nQuota share previsional ceding commission rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal lines\n</td> <td> 55%\n</td> <td> 52%\n</td> <td> 40%\n</td> <td> 55%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of ceding commission revenue (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> <td>\nPercent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provisional ceding commissions earned\n</td> <td> $12,769\n</td> <td> $11,692\n</td> <td> $1,077\n</td> <td> 9.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingent ceding commissions earned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingent ceding commissions earned excluding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> the effect of catastrophes\n</td> <td> (1,501)\n</td> <td> 1,062\n</td> <td> (2,563)\n</td> <td> (241.3)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of catastrophes on ceding commissions earned\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> (1,281)\n</td> <td> 1,281\n</td> <td> (100.0)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingent ceding commissions earned\n</td> <td> (1,501)\n</td> <td> (219)\n</td> <td> (1,282)\n</td> <td> 585.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total ceding commission revenue\n</td> <td> $11,268\n</td> <td> $11,473\n</td> <td> $(205)\n</td> <td> (1.8) %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCeding commission revenue was $11,268,000 in 2016 compared to $11,473,000 in 2015. The decrease of $205,000, or 1.8%, was due to a decrease in contingent ceding commissions earned, partially offset by an increase in provisional ceding commissions earned.\nProvisional Ceding Commissions Earned\nWe receive a provisional ceding commission based on ceded written premiums. In 2016 our provisional ceding rate was 55% from January 1 through June 30 under the 2015/2016 Treaty and was reduced to 52% effective July 1, 2016 under the 2016/2017 Treaty. In 2015 our provisional ceding rate was 40% from January 1 through June 30 under the 2014/2015 Treaty and was increased to 55% effective July 1, 2015 under the 2015/2016 Treaty. The variations in the ceding commission rate resulted in weighted average rates during 2016 and 2015 of 53.5% and 47.5%, respectively.\nThe $1,077,000 increase in provisional ceding commissions earned is due to: (1) an increase in personal lines direct written premiums subject to the quota share and (2) an increase in the weighted average provisional ceding commission rates as discussed above, partially offset by (1) a decrease in the amount of premiums subject to provisional ceding commissions due to the reduction in quota share rates to 40% beginning July 1, 2015 and (2) a decrease in the percentage of ceded premiums subject to quota share under the net\u201d quota share treaties in effect beginning July 1, 2015 compared to the gross\u201d 2014/2015 Treaty that expired on June 30, 2015.\nContingent Ceding Commissions Earned\nAs a result of the increase in the provisional ceding commission rates to 52% under the 2016/2017 Treaty and 55% under the 2015/2016 Treaty beginning July 1, 2015, from 40% under the 2014/2015 Treaty, we do not have an opportunity to earn as much contingent ceding commissions. Under the net\u201d treaty in effect as of July 1, 2015, catastrophe losses in excess of the $4,000,000 retention will fall outside of the quota share treaty and such losses will not have an impact on contingent ceding commissions, as was the case under previous gross\u201d treaties. The new net\u201d structure eliminates the adverse impact that catastrophe losses can have on contingent ceding commissions.\nWe receive a contingent ceding commission based on a sliding scale in relation to the losses incurred under our quota share treaties. The lower the ceded loss ratio, the more contingent commission we receive. The amount of contingent ceding commissions we are eligible to receive under the personal lines quota share treaties detailed in the table above that were in effect during 2016 are subject to change based on losses incurred from claims with accident dates beginning July 1, 2015. The amount of contingent ceding commissions we are eligible to receive under our prior years' quota share treaties is subject to change based on losses incurred related to claims with accident dates before July 1, 2015 under those treaties.\nIn 2015, in addition to the 2015/2016 Treaty, which was effective as of July 1, 2015, our personal lines reinsurance quota share treaty that expired on June 30, 2015 covered the period from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2015 ( 2013/2015 Treaty\u201d). The computation to arrive at contingent ceding commission revenue under the 2013/2015 Treaty included catastrophe losses and LAE incurred from severe winter weather during 2015 (see discussion of Net Loss and LAE\u201d below). Such losses increased our ceded loss ratio in our 2013/2015 Treaty, which reduced our contingent ceding commission revenue in accordance with the sliding scale discussed above in 2015 by $1,281,000. Catastrophe losses for 2016 have no impact on our contingent ceding commission revenue since the ultimate loss ratio used to determine these commissions was not affected by the 2016 severe winter weather. See Reinsurance\u201d below for changes to our personal lines quota share treaty effective July 1, 2016.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income was $3,116,000 in 2016 compared to $2,564,000 in 2015. The increase of $552,000, or 21.5%, was due to an increase in average invested assets in 2016. The increase in cash and invested assets resulted primarily from increased operating cash flows for the period after June 30, 2015. The increase in operating cash flows is due in part from the reduction in quota share rates on July 1, 2015. The reduction in quota share rates results in a decline in ceded premiums, which leads to more cash flow and more invested funds. The pre-tax equivalent investment yield on estimated annual income, excluding cash, was 4.26% and 4.77% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the pre-tax equivalent investment yield is due to a shift toward shorter duration investments, which inherently have a lower yield. A reduction in interest rates resulted in an increase to unrealized gains on our portfolio, which in turn reduced the pre-tax equivalent investment yield.\nOther Income\nOther income was $1,115,000 in 2016 compared to $1,577,000 in 2015. The decrease of $462,000, or 29.3%, was primarily due to: (1) the $350,000 we received in 2015 as early settlement of the termination agreement that generated placement fees in our premium finance business (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (2) $154,000 we earned in 2015 in connection with the settlement of a liability, partially offset by an increase in installment and finance fees earned in our insurance underwriting business.\nNet Loss and LAE\nNet loss and LAE was $27,789,000 in 2016 compared to $23,180,000 in 2015. The net loss ratio was 45.3% in 2016 compared to 47.7% in 2015, a decrease of 2.4 percentage points.\nThe following graphs summarize the changes in the components of net loss ratio for the periods indicated:\nDuring 2016, the net loss ratio decreased compared to 2015 due to a combination of several factors. First, there was a reduction in the impact of severe winter weather, defined as the losses incurred above those expected in an average winter. In 2016 we recorded 2.3 points of impact from severe winter weather, compared to 4.3 points in 2015, or a decrease of 2.0 points. In addition, the core loss ratio excluding the impact of severe winter weather and prior year development decreased to 43.1% in 2016 from 44.4% in 2015, or a decrease of 1.3 points. Partially offsetting these declines, we recorded 0.1 points of favorable prior year loss development in 2016 compared to 1.0 point of favorable prior year development in 2015, or a decrease in the favorable impact of 0.9 points year-over-year. The decrease in the core net loss ratio is driven by reduced claim frequency in both our personal and commercial lines business. See table below under Additional Financial Information\u201d summarizing net loss ratios by line of business.\nCommercial Auto Line of Business\nEffective October 1, 2014 we decided to no longer accept applications for new commercial auto coverage. The action was taken following a series of underwriting and pricing measures which were intended to improve the profitability of this line of business. The actions taken did not yield the hoped for results. In February 2015, we decided to no longer offer renewals to our existing commercial auto policies beginning with those that expired on or after May 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we had no commercial auto policies in force, compared to 134 policies in force as of December 31, 2015.\nThe decision to exit this line of business has significantly reduced the adverse impact that associated commercial auto liability claims will have on our overall results. The following table displays the impact that this decision has had on our loss and LAE reserves over time:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommercial Auto\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommercial Auto as a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAs of\n</td> <td>\nNumber of Open Claims\n</td> <td>\nLoss and LAE Reserves\n</td> <td>\nTotal Loss and LAE Reserves\n</td> <td>\nPercentage of Total Loss and LAE Reserves\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands except number of open claims)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $9,185\n</td> <td> $34,503\n</td> <td> 26.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $8,126\n</td> <td> $39,613\n</td> <td> 20.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $4,971\n</td> <td> $39,877\n</td> <td> 12.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $2,434\n</td> <td> $41,737\n</td> <td> 5.8%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommercial auto liability loss and LAE reserves account for a rapidly decreasing percentage of our total loss and LAE reserves, and as of December 31, 2016 comprise 5.8% of our total loss and LAE reserves. This line of business was historically subject to a high level of uncertainty and volatility in claim emergence and loss development. The exit from this line therefore significantly decreases the uncertainty surrounding our overall reserve levels and reduces the associated volatility in financial results.\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense was $18,327,000 in 2016 or 18.9 % of direct earned premiums. Commission expense was $15,317,000 in 2015 or 18.6% of direct earned premiums. The increase of $3,010,000 is due to the increase in direct written premiums in 2016 as compared to 2015 and an increase in bonus commissions as a result of the decrease in net loss ratio in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in the percentage of commission expense to direct earned premiums to 18.9% in 2016 from 18.6% in 2015 is due the additional bonus commission described above and a change in the mix of business to lines of business with higher commission rates.\nOther Underwriting Expenses\nOther underwriting expenses were $14,867,000 in 2016 compared to $12,833,000 in 2015. The increase of $2,034,000, or 15.8%, in other underwriting expenses was primarily due to expenses directly and indirectly related to growth in direct written premiums. We are also incurring expenses related to our efforts to expand into the other states in which we recently obtained licensing ( Expansion Expenses\u201d). Expenses directly related to the increase in direct written premiums primarily consist of underwriting expenses, software usage fees and state premium taxes. Expenses indirectly related to the increase in direct written premiums primarily consist of salaries along with related other employment costs. Expansion Expenses include salaries and employment costs, professional fees, IT and data services. Salaries and employment costs were $7,036,000 in 2016 compared to $5,857,000 in 2015. The increase of $1,179,000, or 20.1%, was due to hiring of additional staff to service our current level of business and anticipated growth in volume. In addition, there were annual rate increases in both salaries and the cost of employee benefits. Other underwriting expenses as a percentage of direct written premiums increased to 14.4% in 2016 from 14.1% in 2015. Other underwriting expenses as a percentage of direct earned premiums decreased to 15.3% in 2016 from 15.5% in 2015. Salaries and employment costs, which accounted for 47.3% of other underwriting expenses in 2016, and 45.6% of other underwriting expenses in 2015, were 7.2% of direct earned premiums in 2016 and 7.1% of direct earned premiums in 2015.\nOur net underwriting expense ratio in 2016 was 33.9% compared with 32.3% in 2015. The following table shows the individual components of our net underwriting expense ratio for the periods indicated:\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPoint Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceding commission revenue - provisional\n</td> <td> (20.8)%\n</td> <td> (24.1)%\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ceding commission revenue - contingent\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> (1.8)\n</td> <td> (2.0)\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquistion costs and other underwriting expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commission expense\n</td> <td> 29.9\n</td> <td> 31.5\n</td> <td> (1.6)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other underwriting expenses\n</td> <td> 24.2\n</td> <td> 26.4\n</td> <td> (2.2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net underwriting expense ratio\n</td> <td> 33.9%\n</td> <td> 32.3%\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase of 1.6 percentage points was due to the individual components of provisional ceding commission revenue, commission expense and other underwriting expenses and their relation to the increase in net premiums earned as a result of the additional retention resulting from the Cut-off to our quota share treaties on July 1, 2015. The increase to the net underwriting expense ratio was impacted more by reductions in the reinsurance ceding commission revenue components than it was to changes in the acquisition costs and other underwriting expense components.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses, related to the expenses of our holding company, were $1,910,000 in 2016 compared to $1,504,000 in 2015. The increase in 2016 of $406,000, or 27.0%, was primarily due to an increase in executive bonus compensation.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $1,125,000 in 2016 compared to $1,032,000 in 2015. The increase of $93,000, or 9.0%, in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to depreciation on newly purchased assets used to upgrade our systems infrastructure and the Kingston, New York home office building from which we operate.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense in 2016 was $4,518,000, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 33.7%. Income tax expense in 2015 was $3,349,000, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 32.5%. Income before taxes was $13,418,000 in 2016 compared to $10,309,000 in 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate by 1.2 percentage points in 2016 is primarily a result of permanent tax true ups from 2015.\nNet Income\nNet income was $8,900,000 in 2016 compared to $6,960,000 in 2015. The increase in net income of $1,940,000, or 27.9%, was due to the circumstances described above that caused the increase in our net premiums earned, net investment income, and a decrease in our net loss ratio, partially offset by a decrease in ceding commission revenue and other income, and by increases in other underwriting expenses related to premium growth and other operating expenses.\nAdditional Financial Information\nWe operate our business as one segment, property and casualty insurance. Within this segment, we offer a wide array of property and casualty policies to our producers. The following table summarizes gross and net premiums written, net premiums earned, and loss and loss adjustment expenses by major product type, which were determined based primarily on similar economic characteristics and risks of loss.\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross written premiums:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal lines\n</td> <td> $79,256,251\n</td> <td> $69,227,233\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial lines\n</td> <td> 12,759,351\n</td> <td> 12,010,892\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial auto(2)\n</td> <td> (5,023)\n</td> <td> 519,920\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Livery physical damage\n</td> <td> 10,955,785\n</td> <td> 9,032,957\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other(3)\n</td> <td> 254,153\n</td> <td> 253,937\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $103,220,517\n</td> <td> $91,044,939\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net written premiums:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Excluding the effect of quota share adjustments on July 1\n</td> <td> $43,485,866\n</td> <td> $33,899,714\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return of premiums previously ceded to prior quota share treaties\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> 5,866,300\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal lines(1)\n</td> <td> 43,485,866\n</td> <td> 39,766,014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial lines\n</td> <td> 11,413,717\n</td> <td> 10,922,649\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial auto(2)\n</td> <td> (110,311)\n</td> <td> 471,135\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Livery physical damage\n</td> <td> 10,955,785\n</td> <td> 9,032,957\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other(3)\n</td> <td> 181,130\n</td> <td> 192,023\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $65,926,187\n</td> <td> $60,384,778\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net premiums earned:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal lines(1)\n</td> <td> $40,325,585\n</td> <td> $29,498,110\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial lines\n</td> <td> 11,120,890\n</td> <td> 10,133,600\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial auto(2)\n</td> <td> (10,567)\n</td> <td> 1,722,381\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Livery physical damage\n</td> <td> 9,783,792\n</td> <td> 7,082,843\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other(3)\n</td> <td> 188,206\n</td> <td> 175,148\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $61,407,906\n</td> <td> $48,612,082\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss and loss adjustment expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal lines\n</td> <td> $16,116,325\n</td> <td> $12,513,907\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial lines\n</td> <td> 5,408,168\n</td> <td> 5,931,699\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial auto(2)\n</td> <td> (553,450)\n</td> <td> 653,898\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Livery physical damage\n</td> <td> 4,777,308\n</td> <td> 2,444,555\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other(3)\n</td> <td> 249,046\n</td> <td> 147,789\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated loss adjustment expenses\n</td> <td> 1,792,264\n</td> <td> 1,488,152\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $27,789,661\n</td> <td> $23,180,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss ratio:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal lines\n</td> <td> 40.0%\n</td> <td> 42.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial lines\n</td> <td> 48.6%\n</td> <td> 58.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial auto(2)\n</td> <td> na\n</td> <td> 38.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Livery physical damage\n</td> <td> 48.8%\n</td> <td> 34.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other(3)\n</td> <td> 132.3%\n</td> <td> 84.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> 45.3%\n</td> <td> 47.7%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________________\n(1) See discussions above for Net Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned, related to change in quota share ceding rate and change in catastrophe reinsurance from gross\u201d basis to net\u201d basis.\n(2) Effective October 1, 2014 we decided to no longer accept applications for new commercial auto coverage.

disclosed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with respect to Fair Value Measurements,\u201d we define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a transaction involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities between market participants (an exit price\u201d). The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources ( observable inputs\u201d) and a reporting entity's internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external market data is limited or unavailable ( unobservable inputs\u201d). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes fair value measurements into three levels based on the nature of the inputs. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets have the highest priority ( Level 1\u201d), followed by observable inputs other than quoted prices including prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities ( Level 2\u201d), and unobservable inputs, including the reporting entity's estimates of the assumption that market participants would use, having the lowest priority ( Level 3\u201d). As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 65% and 66%, respectively, of the investment portfolio recorded at fair value was priced based upon quoted market prices.\nAs more fully described in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Investments-Impairment Review,\u201d we completed a detailed review of all our securities in a continuous loss position as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016 our held-to-maturity debt securities included an investment in one bond issued by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ( PR\u201d). In July 2016, PR defaulted on its interest payment to bondholders. Due to the credit deterioration of PR, we recorded a credit loss component of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) on this investment as of June 30, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the full amount of the write-down was recognized as a credit component of OTTI in the amount of $69,911 and is included as a reduction to net realized gains in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. We concluded that the other unrealized losses in these asset classes are temporary in nature and the result of a decrease in value due to technical spread widening and broader market sentiment, rather than fundamental collateral deterioration.\nThe table below summarizes the gross unrealized losses of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale and equity securities by length of time the security has continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 37: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess

at December 31, 2016 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss, none of which were deemed by us to be other than temporarily impaired. There were 57 securities at December 31, 2015 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss, none of which were deemed by us to be other than temporarily impaired. Significant factors influencing our determination that unrealized losses were temporary included the magnitude of the unrealized losses in relation to each security's cost, the nature of the investment and management's intent not to sell these securities and it being not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these investments before anticipated recovery of fair value to our cost basis.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe primary sources of cash flow are from our insurance underwriting subsidiary, KICO, and include direct premiums written, ceding commissions from our quota share reinsurers, loss recovery payments from our reinsurers, investment income and proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments. Funds are used by KICO for ceded premium payments to reinsurers, which are paid on a net basis after subtracting losses paid on reinsured claims and reinsurance commissions. KICO also uses funds for loss payments and loss adjustment expenses on our net business, commissions to producers, salaries and other underwriting expenses as well as to purchase investments and fixed assets.\nIn April 2016 we sold 595,238 newly issued shares of our common stock to RenaissanceRe Ventures Ltd., a subsidiary of RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:RNR) ( RenaissanceRe\u201d), in a private placement. RenaissanceRe is a global provider of catastrophe and specialty reinsurance and insurance. The new common shares were sold to RenaissanceRe at a price of $8.40 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $4,808,000 from the private placement. In June 2016, we invested $3,000,000 of the proceeds in KICO as additional surplus to support its continued growth. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds of the offering to support the continued growth of KICO, and for general corporate purposes.\nOn January 31, 2017, we closed on an underwritten public offering of 2,500,000 shares of our common stock. On February 14, 2017, we closed on the underwriters' 30-day purchase option for an additional 192,500 shares our common stock. The public offering price for the 2,692,500 shares sold was $12.00 per share. The aggregate net proceeds to us was approximately $30,230,000. On March 1, 2017, we used $23,000,000 of the net proceeds of the offering to contribute capital to KICO, to support its ratings upgrade plan and additional growth. The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.\nThrough December 31, 2016, the primary sources of cash flow for our holding company are dividends received from KICO, subject to statutory restrictions. For year ended December 31, 2016, KICO paid dividends of $1,950,000 to us.\nIf the aforementioned sources of cash flow currently available are insufficient to cover our holding company cash requirements, we will seek to obtain additional financing.\nOur reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operations is generally influenced by the collection of premiums in advance of paid losses, the timing of reinsurance, issuing company settlements and loss payments.\nCash flow and liquidity are categorized into three sources: (1) operating activities; (2) investing activities; and (3) financing activities, which are shown in the following table:\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td>\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> $15,201,025\n</td> <td> $20,401,907\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> (19,515,843)\n</td> <td> (14,902,052)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> 2,807,966\n</td> <td> (1,855,361)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> (1,506,852)\n</td> <td> 3,644,494\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n</td> <td> 13,551,372\n</td> <td> 9,906,878\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period\n</td> <td> $12,044,520\n</td> <td> $13,551,372\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15,201,000 in 2016 as compared to $20,402,000 provided in 2015. The $5,201,000 decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2016 was primarily a result of an increase in cash arising from net fluctuations in assets and liabilities relating to operating activities of KICO as affected by the growth in its operations which are described above, and an increase in net income (adjusted for non-cash items) of $1,485,000.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $19,516,000 in 2016 compared to $14,902,000 used in 2015. The $4,614,000 increase in cash used in investing activities is the result of a $21,097,000 increase in acquisitions of invested assets, offset by a $684,000 reduction in the amount of fixed asset acquisitions in 2016 and collection of a $250,000 note receivable included in other assets, and a $15,559,000 increase in sales or maturities of invested assets.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $2,808,000 in 2016 compared to $1,855,000 used in 2015. The $4,663,000 increase in cash provided by financing activities is the result of the $4,808,000 net proceeds we received from the private placement of our common stock in April 2016 and a $164,000 decrease in the purchase of treasury stock, offset partially by a $384,000 increase in dividends paid due an increase in the dividend rate and shares outstanding.\nReinsurance\nThe following table provides summary information with respect to each reinsurer that accounted for more than 10% of our reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRecoverable\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nA.M.\n</td> <td>\nas of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\nBest Rating\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maiden Reinsurace Company\n</td> <td> A\n</td> <td> $8,625\n</td> <td> 47.7%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Swiss Reinsurance America Corporation\n</td> <td> A+\n</td> <td> 4,981\n</td> <td> 27.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,606\n</td> <td> 75.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Others\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,490\n</td> <td> 24.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $18,096\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReinsurance recoverable from Maiden Reinsurance Company and Motors Insurance Corporation (included in Others) are secured pursuant to collateralized trust agreements.

We attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in establishing our reserves, especially as it relates to medical and hospital rates where historical inflation rates have exceeded the general level of inflation. Inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and loss adjustment expenses to be higher than we anticipated, which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings.\nFluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates, which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new investments. Operating expenses, including salaries and benefits, generally are impacted by inflation.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, or liquidity that are material to investors.\nFactors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition\nBased upon the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. These factors, among others, may affect the accuracy of certain forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nAs a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events.\nBecause of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events (such as Superstorm Sandy), our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, severe winter weather, storms and certain types of terrorism. We have catastrophe reinsurance coverage with regard to losses of up to $252,000,000. The initial $5,000,000 of losses in a catastrophe are subject to a 40% quota share reinsurance treaty, such that we retain $3,000,000 of risk per catastrophe occurrence. With respect to any additional catastrophe losses of up to $247,000,000, we are 100% reinsured under our catastrophe reinsurance program. Catastrophe coverage is limited on an annual basis to two times the per occurrence amounts. We may incur catastrophe losses in excess of: (i) those that we project would be incurred, (ii) those that external modeling firms estimate would be incurred, (iii) the average expected level used in pricing or (iv) our current reinsurance coverage limits. Despite our catastrophe management programs, we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which may result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our financial strength ratings. In addition, the reinsurance losses that are incurred in connection with a catastrophe could have an adverse impact on the terms and conditions of future reinsurance treaties.\nIn addition, we are subject to claims arising from non-catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, severe winter weather, rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of claims when severe weather conditions occur.\nUnanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in the severity or frequency of claims may affect our profitability. Changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry, in building materials and home furnishings, and by other economic and environmental factors, including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes. Changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy and by litigation costs. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, prices of auto parts and used car prices. However, changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict, such as a change in the law or an inability to enforce exclusions and limitations contained in our policies. Although we pursue various loss management initiatives to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity, and a significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe inability to obtain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best, or a downgrade in our rating, may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, the marketability of our product offerings, and our liquidity, operating results and financial condition.\nFinancial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company's business. Many insurance buyers, agents, brokers and secured lenders use the ratings assigned by A.M. Best and other agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies with which they do business or from which they are considering purchasing insurance or in determining the financial strength of the company that provides insurance with respect to the collateral they hold. KICO currently has an A.M. Best financial strength rating of B++ (Good). A.M. Best ratings are derived from an in-depth evaluation of an insurance company's balance sheet strengths, operating performances and business profiles. A.M. Best evaluates, among other factors, the company's capitalization, underwriting leverage, financial leverage, asset leverage, capital structure, quality and appropriateness of reinsurance, adequacy of reserves, quality and diversification of assets, liquidity, profitability, spread of risk, revenue composition, market position, management, market risk and event risk. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies such as A.M. Best review the financial performance and condition of insurers and can downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer's ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurer's statutory capital, a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the insurer's control. KICO currently has a Demotech financial stability rating of A (Exceptional), which generally makes its policies acceptable to mortgage lenders that require homeowners to purchase insurance. All ratings are subject to continuous review; therefore, the retention of these ratings cannot be assured. The inability to obtain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best or a downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our competitiveness, the marketability of our product offerings and our ability to grow in the marketplace.\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms.\nThe capital and credit markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. In some cases, markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity. In the event that we need access to additional capital to support our operating expenses, make payments on any future indebtedness, pay for capital expenditures, or increase the amount of insurance that we seek to underwrite or to otherwise grow our business, our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant. Our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to our industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as lenders' perception of our long or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If a combination of these factors occurs, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms.\nWe are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and our net investment income can vary from period to period.\nWe are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, equity prices, market volatility, general economic conditions, the performance of the specific obligors included in our portfolio, and other factors outside our control. Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive instruments, such as fixed income securities, which may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates from governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. A rise in interest rates would increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio, which would be offset by our ability to earn higher rates of return on funds reinvested. Conversely, a decline in interest rates would decrease the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio, which would be offset by lower rates of return on funds reinvested.\nIn addition, market volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent. As such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. If significant, continued volatility, changes in interest rates, changes in defaults, a lack of pricing transparency, market liquidity and declines in equity prices, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, impairments, and changes in unrealized positions.\nReinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business or to obtain and maintain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best.\nOur personal lines catastrophe reinsurance program was designed, utilizing our risk management methodology, to address our exposure to catastrophes. Market conditions beyond our control impact the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be given that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as currently available. For example, our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk may be dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for its cost, and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our current reinsurance program will continue to be available in the future. If we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we will have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk, reduce our insurance writings or seek other alternatives. Our ability to obtain and maintain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best depends, in part, on our ability to purchase additional catastrophe reinsurance.\nWe intend to prudently reduce our reliance on quota share reinsurance, in part to obtain and maintain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best; this would lead to greater exposure to net insurance losses.\nWe have determined it to be in the best interests of our shareholders to prudently reduce our reliance on quota share reinsurance. Our ability to obtain and maintain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best depends, in part, on reducing the amount of premium ceded to reinsurers under our quota share reinsurance treaty. Any such reduction would result in higher earned premiums and a reduction in ceding commission revenue in future years. Such reduction would also lead to increased exposure to net insurance losses.\nReinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including changes in market conditions, whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. Since we are primarily liable to an insured for the full amount of insurance coverage, our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nApplicable insurance laws regarding the change of control of our company may impede potential acquisitions that our shareholders might consider to be desirable.\nWe are subject to statutes and regulations of the state of New York which generally require that any person or entity desiring to acquire direct or indirect control of KICO, our insurance company subsidiary, obtain prior regulatory approval. In addition, a change of control of Kingstone Companies, Inc. would require such approval. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of our company, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions. Some of our shareholders might consider such transactions to be desirable. Similar regulations may apply in other states in which we may operate.\nThe insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation that may affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business, and changes within this regulatory environment may adversely affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations. State insurance regulators are charged with protecting policyholders and have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers over our business practices. These include, among other things, the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business and the power to regulate and approve underwriting practices and rate changes, which may delay the implementation of premium rate changes or prevent us from making changes we believe are necessary to match rate to risk. In addition, many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer's ability to cancel or not renew policies and that prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business written in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by state regulatory authorities. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets.\nBecause the laws and regulations under which we operate are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, including state insurance regulators, state securities administrators and the SEC, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another's interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal and regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding he actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thereby necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and/or to improve the profitability of our business.\nWhile the United States federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry, federal legislation and administrative policies can affect us. Congress and various federal agencies periodically discuss proposals that would provide for a federal charter for insurance companies. We cannot predict whether any such laws will be enacted or the effect that such laws would have on our business. Moreover, there can be no assurance that changes will not be made to current laws, rules and regulations, or that any other laws, rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future, that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to maintain the requisite amount of risk-based capital, which may adversely affect our profitability and our ability to compete in the property and casualty insurance markets.\nThe DFS imposes risk-based capital requirements on insurance companies to ensure that insurance companies maintain appropriate levels of surplus to support their overall business operations and to protect customers against adverse developments, after taking into account default, credit, underwriting, reserve and off-balance sheet risks. If the amount of our capital falls below certain thresholds, we may face restrictions with respect to soliciting new business and/or keeping existing business. Similar regulations will apply in other states in which we may operate.\nChanging climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, profitability or cash flows.\nWe recognize the scientific view that the world is getting warmer. Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency and/or severity of weather events and affect the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance.\nOur operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business.\nThe property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. A downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nBecause substantially all of our revenue is currently derived from sources located in New York, our business may be adversely affected by conditions in such state.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently derived from sources located in the state of New York and, accordingly, is affected by the prevailing regulatory, economic, demographic, competitive and other conditions in the state. Changes in any of these conditions could make it more costly or difficult for us to conduct our business. Adverse regulatory developments in New York, which could include fundamental changes to the design or implementation of the insurance regulatory framework, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are highly dependent on a small number of insurance brokers for a large portion of our revenues.\nWe market our insurance products primarily through insurance brokers. A large percentage of our gross premiums written are sourced through a limited number of brokers. These brokers provided a total of 36.5% of our gross premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2016. The nature of our dependency on these brokers relates to the high volume of business they consistently refer to us. Our relationship with these brokers is based on the quality of the underwriting and claims services we provide to our clients and on our financial strength ratings. Any deterioration in these factors could result in these brokers advising clients to place their risks with other insurers rather than with us. A loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory action taken by the New York State Department of Financial Services following Superstorm Sandy may affect our operations and business.\nIn the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, the DFS has adopted various regulations that affect insurance companies that operate in the state of New York. Included among the regulations are accelerated claims investigation and settlement requirements and mandatory participation in non-binding mediation proceedings funded by the insurer. In settling insurance claims, including those related to Superstorm Sandy, if KICO were to pay for losses not covered by the insurance policy, such as those based on water and sewer back up claims, it could face disclaimers of coverage from its reinsurers with regard to the amounts paid.\nActual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nRecorded claim reserves for our business are based on our best estimates of losses after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances. Internal and external factors are considered. Internal factors include, but are not limited to, actual claims paid, pending levels of unpaid claims, product mix and contractual terms. External factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the law, court decisions, changes in regulatory requirements and economic conditions. Because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves, and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on the results of operations of our subsidiary KICO; there are restrictions on the payment of dividends by KICO.\nWe are a holding company and a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiary, KICO. As a holding company with limited operations of our own, currently the principal sources of our funds are dividends and other payments from KICO. Consequently, we must rely on KICO for our ability to repay debts, pay expenses and pay cash dividends to our shareholders.\nOur ability to receive dividends from KICO is restricted by the state laws and insurance regulations of New York. These restrictions are related to surplus and net investment income. Maximum permissible dividends are restricted to the lesser of 10% of surplus or 100% of net investment income (on a statutory accounting basis) for the trailing 36 months, less dividends paid by KICO during such period. As of December 31, 2016, the maximum permissible distribution that KICO could pay without prior regulatory approval was approximately $4,385,000.\nOur future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive.\nThe insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have well-established national reputations, substantially more capital and significantly greater marketing and management resources. Because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, including competition for customers, agents and brokers, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and to maintain profitable operating results or financial condition.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our ability to implement our business strategies could be delayed or hindered.\nOur future success will depend, in part, upon the efforts of Barry Goldstein, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Benjamin Walden, Executive Vice President and Chief Actuary of KICO. The loss of Mr. Goldstein, Mr. Walden or other key personnel could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategies and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we continue to grow, we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel, but we may not be able to do so. Our ability to recruit and retain such personnel will depend upon a number of factors, such as our results of operations and prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel. Mr. Goldstein is a party to an employment agreement with us that expires on December 31, 2019. Mr. Walden is not a party to an employment agreement with KICO.\nDifficult conditions in the economy generally could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs with most businesses, we believe that difficult conditions in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. General economic conditions also could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior, which may include decreased demand for our products. As consumers become more cost conscious, they may choose lower levels of insurance.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles, which are periodically revised, interpreted and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or those of one or more of our vendors.\nOur business requires that we develop and maintain computer systems to run our operations and to store a significant volume of confidential data. Some of these systems rely on third-party vendors, through either a connection to, or an integration with, those third-parties' systems. In the course of our operations, we acquire the personal confidential information of our customers and employees. We also store our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business and financial information.\nAll of these systems are subject to cyber attacks\u201d by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities, and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees, consultants, agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems. Such attacks or actions may include attempts to:\n\u25cf steal, corrupt, or destroy data, including our intellectual property, financial data or the personal information of our customers or employees\n\u25cf misappropriate funds\n\u25cf disrupt or shut down our systems\n\u25cf deny customers, agents, brokers, or others access to our systems, or\n\u25cf infect our systems with viruses or malware.\nWhile we can take defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun. Our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack. In addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen. In addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations. We have a cyber insurance policy to protect against the monetary impact of some of these risks. However, the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber-attack, if sufficiently severe, could have a material adverse effect on our business results.\nWe rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems, and the failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems. We rely on these systems to support our operations. The failure of these systems could interrupt our operations and result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, increased costs as a result of being an SEC reporting company.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as a variety of related rules implemented by the SEC, have required changes in corporate governance practices and generally increased the disclosure requirements of public companies. As a reporting company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with our public disclosure and other obligations. Based upon SEC regulations currently in effect, we are required to establish, evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. We believe that compliance with the myriad of rules and regulations applicable to reporting companies and related compliance issues will require a significant amount of time and attention from our management.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly and be highly volatile and this may make it difficult for shareholders to resell shares of our common stock at the volume, prices and times they find attractive.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations and be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for shareholders to resell shares of our common stock at the volume, prices and times they find attractive. There are many factors that will impact our stock price and trading volume, including, but not limited to, the factors listed above under Risks Related to Our Business.\u201d\nStock markets, in general, have experienced in recent years, and continue to experience, significant price and volume volatility, and the market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations that may be unrelated to our operating performance and prospects. Increased market volatility and fluctuations could result in a substantial decline in the market price of our common stock.\nThe trading volume in our common stock has been limited. As a result, shareholders may not experience liquidity in their investment in our common stock, thereby potentially limiting their ability to resell their shares at the volume, times and prices they find attractive.\nOur common stock is currently traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market. Our common stock has substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for many other publicly traded insurance and other companies. An active trading market for our common stock may not develop or, if developed, may not be sustained. Such stocks can be more volatile than stocks trading in an active public market. Therefore, shareholders have reduced liquidity and may not be able to sell their shares at the volume, prices and times that they desire.\nThere may be future issuances or resales of our common stock which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSubject to any required state insurance regulatory approvals, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock in the future, including securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock. Our issuance of additional shares of common stock in the future will dilute the ownership interests of our then existing shareholders.\nWe have effective registrations on Form S-3 under the Securities Act registering for resale an aggregate of 1,254,238 shares of our common stock and effective registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act registering an aggregate of 700,000 shares of our common stock issuable under our 2005 Equity Participation Plan and an aggregate of 700,000 shares of our common stock issuable under our 2014 Equity Participation Plan. Options to purchase 267,750 shares of our common stock are outstanding under the 2005 plan. Options to purchase 90,000 shares of our common stock are outstanding under the 2014 plan and 578,500 shares are reserved for issuance thereunder. We have also registered up to $9,290,000 of our securities pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 which we may sell from time to time in one or more offerings. The shares subject to the registration statements on Form S-3 will be freely tradeable in the public market. In addition, the shares issuable pursuant to the registration statements on Form S-8 will be freely tradable in the public market, except for shares held by affiliates.\nThe sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock, whether directly by us or selling shareholders in future offerings or by our existing shareholders in the secondary market, the perception that such issuances or resales could occur or the availability for future issuances or resale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities on attractive terms or at all.\nIn addition, our board of directors is authorized to designate and issue preferred stock without further shareholder approval, and we may issue other equity and equity-related securities that are senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, to support operations and growth, to maintain our capital ratios, and to comply with any future changes in regulatory standards.\nOur executive officers and directors own a substantial number of shares of our common stock. This will enable them to significantly influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders.\nAs of March 16, 2017, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned 1,266,659 shares of our common stock (including options to purchase 217,500 shares of our common stock), representing 11.7% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.\nAccordingly, our executive officers and directors, through their beneficial ownership of our common stock, will be able to significantly influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including the election of directors, amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, mergers or other business combination transactions and certain sales of assets outside the usual and regular course of business. The interests of our executive officers and directors may not coincide with the interests of our other shareholders, and they could take actions that advance their own interests to the detriment of our other shareholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions and the regulations to which we may be subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nWe are a holding company incorporated in Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as regulatory approvals required under state insurance laws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent shareholders from receiving a premium for their shares of common stock. Our certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors may issue up to 2,500,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, without shareholder approval and with such terms, preferences, rights and privileges as the board of directors may deem appropriate. These provisions, the control of our executive officers and directors over the election of our directors, and other factors may hinder or prevent a change in control, even if the change in control would be beneficial to, or sought by, our shareholders.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nWe offer property and casualty insurance products to individuals and small businesses in New York State through our wholly owned subsidiary, Kingstone Insurance Company ( KICO\u201d). KICO's insureds are located primarily in downstate New York, consisting of New York City, Long Island and Westchester County. We are also licensed in the States of New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Texas. In October 2016, a homeowners rate, rule, and form filing was approved for use by the State of New Jersey. We anticipate writing business there in the first half of 2017.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from KICO, which includes revenues from earned premiums, ceding commissions from quota share reinsurance, net investment income generated from its portfolio, and net realized gains and losses on investment securities. All of KICO's insurance policies are for a one year period. Earned premiums represent premiums received from insureds, which are recognized as revenue over the period of time that insurance coverage is provided (i.e., ratably over the one year life of the policy). A significant period of time normally elapses between the receipt of insurance premiums and the payment of insurance claims. During this time, KICO invests the premiums, earns investment income and generates net realized and unrealized investment gains and losses on investments.\nOur expenses include the insurance underwriting expenses of KICO and other operating expenses. Insurance companies incur a significant amount of their total expenses from losses incurred by policyholders, which are commonly referred to as claims. In settling these claims, various loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) are incurred such as insurance adjusters' fees and legal expenses. In addition, insurance companies incur policy acquisition costs. Policy acquisition costs include commissions paid to producers, premium taxes, and other expenses related to the underwriting process, including employees' compensation and benefits.\nOther operating expenses include our corporate expenses as a holding company. These expenses include legal and auditing fees, executive employment costs, and other costs directly associated with being a public company.\nPrincipal Revenue and Expense Items\nNet premiums earned. Net premiums earned is the earned portion of our written premiums, less that portion of premium that is ceded to third party reinsurers under reinsurance agreements. The amount ceded under these reinsurance agreements is based on a contractual formula contained in the individual reinsurance agreement. Insurance premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the policy. At the end of each reporting period, premiums written that are not earned are classified as unearned premiums and are earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. Our insurance policies have a term of one year. Accordingly, for a one-year policy written on July 1, 2016, we would earn half of the premiums in 2016 and the other half in 2017.\nCeding commission revenue. Commissions on reinsurance premiums ceded are earned in a manner consistent with the recognition of the direct acquisition costs of the underlying insurance policies, generally on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured.\nNet investment income and net realized gains (losses) on investments. We invest in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, fixed-maturity and equity securities. Our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets, less investment expenses. Net realized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income. Net realized gains occur when our investment securities are sold for more than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable. Net realized losses occur when our investment securities are sold for less than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable, or are written down as a result of other-than-temporary impairment. We classify equity securities as available-for-sale and our fixed-maturity securities as either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Net unrealized gains (losses) on those securities classified as available-for-sale are reported separately within accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet.\nOther income. We recognize installment fee income and fees charged to reinstate a policy after it has been cancelled for non-payment. Through March 31, 2015, we also recognized premium finance fee income on loans financed by a third party finance company.\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses incurred. Loss and LAE incurred represent our largest expense item, and for any given reporting period include estimates of future claim payments, changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating, defending and servicing claims. These expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure. We record loss and LAE related to estimates of future claim payments based on case-by-case valuations, statistical analyses and actuarial procedures. We seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate liability based on our historical claims experience. It is typical for certain claims to take several years to settle and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information on such claims. Our ability to estimate loss and LAE accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor affecting our profitability.\nCommission expenses and other underwriting expenses. Other underwriting expenses include policy acquisition costs and other expenses related to the underwriting of policies. Policy acquisition costs represent the costs of originating new insurance policies that vary with, and are primarily related to, the production of insurance policies (principally commissions, premium taxes and certain underwriting salaries). Policy acquisition costs are deferred and recognized as expense as the related premiums are earned. Other underwriting expenses represent general and administrative expenses of our insurance business and are comprised of other costs associated with our insurance activities such as regulatory fees, telecommunication and technology costs, occupancy costs, employment costs, and legal and auditing fees.\nOther operating expenses. Other operating expenses include the corporate expenses of our holding company, Kingstone Companies, Inc. These expenses include executive employment costs, legal and auditing fees, and other costs directly associated with being a public company.\nStock-based compensation. Non-cash equity compensation includes the fair value of stock grants issued to our directors, officers and employees, and amortization of stock options issued to the same.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization includes the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of KICO, depreciation of the real estate used in KICO's operations, as well as depreciation of capital expenditures for information technology projects, office equipment and furniture.\nIncome tax expense. We incur federal income tax expense on our consolidated operations as well as state income tax expense for our non-insurance underwriting subsidiaries.\nProduct Lines\nOur product lines include the following:\nPersonal lines: Our largest line of business is personal lines, consisting of homeowners, dwelling fire, 3-4 family dwelling package, cooperative and condominium, renters, equipment breakdown and service line endorsements, and personal umbrella policies.\nCommercial liability: We offer businessowners policies, which consist primarily of small business retail, service, and office risks without a residential exposure. We also write artisan's liability policies for small independent contractors with seven or fewer employees. In addition, we write special multi-peril policies for larger and more specialized businessowners' risks, including those with limited residential exposures. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we began offering commercial umbrella policies written above our supporting commercial lines policies.\nCommercial automobile: Until recently we provided liability and physical damage coverage for light commercial vehicles. However, due to the poor performance of this line, effective October 1, 2014, we decided to no longer accept new commercial auto policies. In February 2015, we decided to no longer offer renewals to our existing commercial auto policies beginning with those that expired on or after May 1, 2015. As of April 30, 2016 we had no commercial auto policies in force and we have 34 open claims remaining as of December 31, 2016.\nLivery physical damage: We write for-hire vehicle physical damage only policies for livery and car service vehicles and taxicabs. These policies insure only the physical damage portion of insurance for such vehicles, with no liability coverage included.\nOther: We write canine legal liability policies and also have a small participation in mandatory state joint underwriting associations.\nKey Measures\nWe utilize the following key measures in analyzing the results of our insurance underwriting business:\nNet loss ratio: The net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company's business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of net losses and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) incurred to net premiums earned.\nNet underwriting expense ratio: The net underwriting expense ratio is a measure of an insurance company's operational efficiency in administering its business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of the sum of acquisition costs (the most significant being commissions paid to our producers) and other underwriting expenses less ceding commission revenue less other income to net premiums earned.\nNet combined ratio: The net combined ratio is a measure of an insurance company's overall underwriting profit. This is the sum of the net loss and net underwriting expense ratios. If the net combined ratio is at or above 100 percent, an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income, and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\nUnderwriting income: Underwriting income is net pre-tax income attributable to our insurance underwriting business before investment activity. It excludes net investment income, net realized gains from investments, and depreciation and amortization (net premiums earned less expenses included in combined ratio). Underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company's overall operating profitability before items such as investment income, depreciation and amortization, interest expense and income taxes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kingstone Companies, Inc. and all majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires our management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, our management has utilized information including our past history, industry standards, and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. It is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by our management in formulating estimates inherent in these financial statements might not materialize. However, application of the critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nWe believe that the most critical accounting policies relate to the reporting of reserves for loss and LAE, including losses that have occurred but have not been reported prior to the reporting date, amounts recoverable from third party reinsurers, deferred ceding commission revenue, deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred income taxes, the impairment of investment securities, intangible assets and the valuation of stock-based compensation. See Note 2 (Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements following Item 15 of this Annual Report.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the results of our operations for the periods indicated:\n\n(1) Effective July 1, 2015, we decreased the quota share ceding rate in our personal lines quota share treaty from 55% to 40% (the Cut-off\u201d). The Cut-off on July 1, 2015 resulted in a $5,866,000 return of unearned premiums from our reinsurers that were previously ceded under the personal lines quota share treaty that expired on June 30, 2015. The $5,866,000 return of premiums previously ceded reduced earned premiums under our quota share, which, in turn, increased our net premiums earned during the twelve month period after the Cut-off.\n(2) Under a gross\u201d basis catastrophe reinsurance treaty, catastrophe reinsurance coverage is purchased by us only on the net written premiums after the quota share. Under a gross\u201d basis, catastrophe losses affect the ceded loss ratio and contingent ceding commissions from quota share reinsurance. Under a net\u201d basis catastrophe reinsurance treaty, all catastrophe reinsurance coverage is purchased by us directly, eliminating the impact of a catastrophe on quota share results. The net\u201d basis increases our ceded premium for catastrophe reinsurance. See discussion below for Net Written Premiums, Net Premiums Earned and Contingent Ceding Commissions Earned.\n\n(3) For the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, includes the effects of severe winter weather (which we define as a catastrophe). We define a catastrophe\u201d as an event or series of related events that involve multiple first party policyholders, or an event or series of events that produce a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time constituting the event or series of events. Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds, excessive rain, winter storms, severe winter weather, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, and hurricanes.\n\nDirect Written Premiums\nDirect written premiums during the year ended December 31, 2016 ( 2016\u201d) were $103,192,000 compared to $91,004,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 ( 2015\u201d). The increase of $12,188,000, or 13.4%, was primarily due to an increase in policies in-force during 2016 as compared to 2015. We wrote more new policies as a result of continued demand for our products in the markets that we serve. Policies in-force increased by 11.7% as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nOur growth rate in direct written premiums was dampened somewhat due to the: (1) slowing of growth in our livery physical damage line of business, and (2) suspension, effective October 1, 2014, of the writing of new policies in our commercial auto line of business due to a history of poor underwriting results. In February 2015, we made the decision to no longer offer renewals on our existing commercial auto policies beginning with those that expired on or after May 1, 2015. Our direct written premiums in our continuing lines of business grew by 14.0% in 2016 compared to 2015. Policies-in-force in our continuing lines of business increased by 12.0% as of December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nNet Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned\nThe following table details the quota share reinsurance ceding rates in effect during 2016 and 2015. For purposes of the discussion herein, the change in quota share ceding rates on July 1 of each year will be referred to as the Cut-off\u201d. This table should be referred to in conjunction with the discussions for net written premiums, net premiums earned, ceding commission revenue and net loss and loss adjustment expenses that follow.\n\nSee Reinsurance\u201d below for changes to our personal lines quota share treaty effective July 1, 2016.\nNet written premiums increased $5,541,000, or 9.2%, to $65,926,000 in 2016 from $60,385,000 in 2015. Net written premiums include direct and assumed premiums, less the amount of written premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties (quota share, excess of loss, and catastrophe). Our personal lines business is currently subject to a quota share treaty. A reduction to the quota share percentage or elimination of a quota share treaty will reduce our ceded written premiums, which will result in a corresponding increase to our net written premiums.\nChange in quota share ceding rate\nEffective July 1, 2015, we decreased the quota share ceding rate in our personal lines quota share treaty from 55% to 40%. The Cut-off of this treaty on July 1, 2015 resulted in a $5,866,000 return of unearned premiums from our reinsurers that were previously ceded under the expiring personal lines quota share treaty. We did not change our quota share ceding rates on July 1, 2016, and accordingly, there was no return of unearned premiums from our reinsurers (in contrast with what occurred on July 1, 2015), thus diminishing the increase in net written premiums in 2016. The table below shows the effect of the $5,866,000 return of ceded premiums on net written premiums for 2015:\n\nWithout the $5,866,000 effect of the Cut-off in 2015, net written premiums increased by $11,407,000, or 20.9%, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nThe 2016/2017 Treaty and 2015/2016 Treaty are on a net\u201d of catastrophe reinsurance basis, as opposed to the gross\u201d arrangement that existed in periods before July 1, 2015.\nChange in catastrophe reinsurance from gross\u201d basis to net\u201d basis\nMost of the premiums written under our personal lines are also subject to our catastrophe treaty. An increase in our personal lines business gives rise to more property exposure, which increases our exposure to catastrophe risk; therefore, our premiums for catastrophe insurance will increase. This results in an increase in premiums ceded under our catastrophe treaty, which reduces net written premiums. With the inception of our personal lines quota share treaty being on a net\u201d basis effective July 1, 2015, our catastrophe premiums are paid based on all of our direct written premiums subject to the quota share, compared to catastrophe premiums being paid only on the amount of written premiums that we retained under the gross\u201d basis that expired on June 30, 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, catastrophe reinsurance was on a net\u201d basis. For the year ended December 31, 2015, catastrophe reinsurance was on a gross\u201d basis through June 30, 2015, and on a net\u201d basis from July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. As a result of the 2015 mid-year change from gross\u201d to net\u201d, comparison between periods in 2016 and 2015 are separated between the six month periods ended June 30 and the six month periods ended December 31. Ceded catastrophe premiums from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016 increased by $2,496,000, or 120.1%, to $4,575,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $2,079,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due the change from gross\u201d to net\u201d. Ceded catastrophe premiums from July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 increased by $485,000, or 10.9%, to $4,954,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2016 from $4,469,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in premiums subject to catastrophe reinsurance.\nExcess of loss reinsurance treaty\nIn general, barring reductions in rates charged for reinsurance, an increase in written premiums will also increase the premiums ceded under our excess of loss treaties. This will incrementally reduce our net written premiums. In 2016, our ceded premiums related to excess of loss reinsurance treaties increased by $112,000 over the ceded premiums for 2015.\nNet premiums earned\nNet premiums earned increased $12,796,000, or 26.3%, to $61,408,000 in 2016 from $48,612,000 in 2015. The increase was primarily due to us retaining more earned premiums effective July 1, 2015, as a result of the reduction of the quota share percentage in our personal lines quota share treaty. The decrease in our quota share ceding percentage from the July 1, 2015 Cut-off gave us a $5,866,000 return of premiums previously ceded, which increased our net premiums earned during the twelve month periods after the Cut-off. In addition, as premiums written earn ratably over a twelve month period, net premiums earned in 2016 increased due to the higher net written premiums generated for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 compared to the twelve month period ended December 31, 2015.\nCeding Commission Revenue\nThe following table details the quota share provisional ceding commission rates in effect during 2016 and 2015. This table should be referred to in conjunction with the discussion for ceding commission revenue that follows.\n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of ceding commission revenue (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\n\nCeding commission revenue was $11,268,000 in 2016 compared to $11,473,000 in 2015. The decrease of $205,000, or 1.8%, was due to a decrease in contingent ceding commissions earned, partially offset by an increase in provisional ceding commissions earned.\nProvisional Ceding Commissions Earned\nWe receive a provisional ceding commission based on ceded written premiums. In 2016 our provisional ceding rate was 55% from January 1 through June 30 under the 2015/2016 Treaty and was reduced to 52% effective July 1, 2016 under the 2016/2017 Treaty. In 2015 our provisional ceding rate was 40% from January 1 through June 30 under the 2014/2015 Treaty and was increased to 55% effective July 1, 2015 under the 2015/2016 Treaty. The variations in the ceding commission rate resulted in weighted average rates during 2016 and 2015 of 53.5% and 47.5%, respectively.\nThe $1,077,000 increase in provisional ceding commissions earned is due to: (1) an increase in personal lines direct written premiums subject to the quota share and (2) an increase in the weighted average provisional ceding commission rates as discussed above, partially offset by (1) a decrease in the amount of premiums subject to provisional ceding commissions due to the reduction in quota share rates to 40% beginning July 1, 2015 and (2) a decrease in the percentage of ceded premiums subject to quota share under the net\u201d quota share treaties in effect beginning July 1, 2015 compared to the gross\u201d 2014/2015 Treaty that expired on June 30, 2015.\nContingent Ceding Commissions Earned\nAs a result of the increase in the provisional ceding commission rates to 52% under the 2016/2017 Treaty and 55% under the 2015/2016 Treaty beginning July 1, 2015, from 40% under the 2014/2015 Treaty, we do not have an opportunity to earn as much contingent ceding commissions. Under the net\u201d treaty in effect as of July 1, 2015, catastrophe losses in excess of the $4,000,000 retention will fall outside of the quota share treaty and such losses will not have an impact on contingent ceding commissions, as was the case under previous gross\u201d treaties. The new net\u201d structure eliminates the adverse impact that catastrophe losses can have on contingent ceding commissions.\nWe receive a contingent ceding commission based on a sliding scale in relation to the losses incurred under our quota share treaties. The lower the ceded loss ratio, the more contingent commission we receive. The amount of contingent ceding commissions we are eligible to receive under the personal lines quota share treaties detailed in the table above that were in effect during 2016 are subject to change based on losses incurred from claims with accident dates beginning July 1, 2015. The amount of contingent ceding commissions we are eligible to receive under our prior years' quota share treaties is subject to change based on losses incurred related to claims with accident dates before July 1, 2015 under those treaties.\nIn 2015, in addition to the 2015/2016 Treaty, which was effective as of July 1, 2015, our personal lines reinsurance quota share treaty that expired on June 30, 2015 covered the period from July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2015 ( 2013/2015 Treaty\u201d). The computation to arrive at contingent ceding commission revenue under the 2013/2015 Treaty included catastrophe losses and LAE incurred from severe winter weather during 2015 (see discussion of Net Loss and LAE\u201d below). Such losses increased our ceded loss ratio in our 2013/2015 Treaty, which reduced our contingent ceding commission revenue in accordance with the sliding scale discussed above in 2015 by $1,281,000. Catastrophe losses for 2016 have no impact on our contingent ceding commission revenue since the ultimate loss ratio used to determine these commissions was not affected by the 2016 severe winter weather. See Reinsurance\u201d below for changes to our personal lines quota share treaty effective July 1, 2016.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income was $3,116,000 in 2016 compared to $2,564,000 in 2015. The increase of $552,000, or 21.5%, was due to an increase in average invested assets in 2016. The increase in cash and invested assets resulted primarily from increased operating cash flows for the period after June 30, 2015. The increase in operating cash flows is due in part from the reduction in quota share rates on July 1, 2015. The reduction in quota share rates results in a decline in ceded premiums, which leads to more cash flow and more invested funds. The pre-tax equivalent investment yield on estimated annual income, excluding cash, was 4.26% and 4.77% as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the pre-tax equivalent investment yield is due to a shift toward shorter duration investments, which inherently have a lower yield. A reduction in interest rates resulted in an increase to unrealized gains on our portfolio, which in turn reduced the pre-tax equivalent investment yield.\nOther Income\nOther income was $1,115,000 in 2016 compared to $1,577,000 in 2015. The decrease of $462,000, or 29.3%, was primarily due to: (1) the $350,000 we received in 2015 as early settlement of the termination agreement that generated placement fees in our premium finance business (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and (2) $154,000 we earned in 2015 in connection with the settlement of a liability, partially offset by an increase in installment and finance fees earned in our insurance underwriting business.\nNet Loss and LAE\nNet loss and LAE was $27,789,000 in 2016 compared to $23,180,000 in 2015. The net loss ratio was 45.3% in 2016 compared to 47.7% in 2015, a decrease of 2.4 percentage points.\nThe following graphs summarize the changes in the components of net loss ratio for the periods indicated:\nDuring 2016, the net loss ratio decreased compared to 2015 due to a combination of several factors. First, there was a reduction in the impact of severe winter weather, defined as the losses incurred above those expected in an average winter. In 2016 we recorded 2.3 points of impact from severe winter weather, compared to 4.3 points in 2015, or a decrease of 2.0 points. In addition, the core loss ratio excluding the impact of severe winter weather and prior year development decreased to 43.1% in 2016 from 44.4% in 2015, or a decrease of 1.3 points. Partially offsetting these declines, we recorded 0.1 points of favorable prior year loss development in 2016 compared to 1.0 point of favorable prior year development in 2015, or a decrease in the favorable impact of 0.9 points year-over-year. The decrease in the core net loss ratio is driven by reduced claim frequency in both our personal and commercial lines business. See table below under Additional Financial Information\u201d summarizing net loss ratios by line of business.\nCommercial Auto Line of Business\nEffective October 1, 2014 we decided to no longer accept applications for new commercial auto coverage. The action was taken following a series of underwriting and pricing measures which were intended to improve the profitability of this line of business. The actions taken did not yield the hoped for results. In February 2015, we decided to no longer offer renewals to our existing commercial auto policies beginning with those that expired on or after May 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we had no commercial auto policies in force, compared to 134 policies in force as of December 31, 2015.\nThe decision to exit this line of business has significantly reduced the adverse impact that associated commercial auto liability claims will have on our overall results. The following table displays the impact that this decision has had on our loss and LAE reserves over time:\n\nCommercial auto liability loss and LAE reserves account for a rapidly decreasing percentage of our total loss and LAE reserves, and as of December 31, 2016 comprise 5.8% of our total loss and LAE reserves. This line of business was historically subject to a high level of uncertainty and volatility in claim emergence and loss development. The exit from this line therefore significantly decreases the uncertainty surrounding our overall reserve levels and reduces the associated volatility in financial results.\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense was $18,327,000 in 2016 or 18.9 % of direct earned premiums. Commission expense was $15,317,000 in 2015 or 18.6% of direct earned premiums. The increase of $3,010,000 is due to the increase in direct written premiums in 2016 as compared to 2015 and an increase in bonus commissions as a result of the decrease in net loss ratio in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in the percentage of commission expense to direct earned premiums to 18.9% in 2016 from 18.6% in 2015 is due the additional bonus commission described above and a change in the mix of business to lines of business with higher commission rates.\nOther Underwriting Expenses\nOther underwriting expenses were $14,867,000 in 2016 compared to $12,833,000 in 2015. The increase of $2,034,000, or 15.8%, in other underwriting expenses was primarily due to expenses directly and indirectly related to growth in direct written premiums. We are also incurring expenses related to our efforts to expand into the other states in which we recently obtained licensing ( Expansion Expenses\u201d). Expenses directly related to the increase in direct written premiums primarily consist of underwriting expenses, software usage fees and state premium taxes. Expenses indirectly related to the increase in direct written premiums primarily consist of salaries along with related other employment costs. Expansion Expenses include salaries and employment costs, professional fees, IT and data services. Salaries and employment costs were $7,036,000 in 2016 compared to $5,857,000 in 2015. The increase of $1,179,000, or 20.1%, was due to hiring of additional staff to service our current level of business and anticipated growth in volume. In addition, there were annual rate increases in both salaries and the cost of employee benefits. Other underwriting expenses as a percentage of direct written premiums increased to 14.4% in 2016 from 14.1% in 2015. Other underwriting expenses as a percentage of direct earned premiums decreased to 15.3% in 2016 from 15.5% in 2015. Salaries and employment costs, which accounted for 47.3% of other underwriting expenses in 2016, and 45.6% of other underwriting expenses in 2015, were 7.2% of direct earned premiums in 2016 and 7.1% of direct earned premiums in 2015.\nOur net underwriting expense ratio in 2016 was 33.9% compared with 32.3% in 2015. The following table shows the individual components of our net underwriting expense ratio for the periods indicated:\n\nThe increase of 1.6 percentage points was due to the individual components of provisional ceding commission revenue, commission expense and other underwriting expenses and their relation to the increase in net premiums earned as a result of the additional retention resulting from the Cut-off to our quota share treaties on July 1, 2015. The increase to the net underwriting expense ratio was impacted more by reductions in the reinsurance ceding commission revenue components than it was to changes in the acquisition costs and other underwriting expense components.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses, related to the expenses of our holding company, were $1,910,000 in 2016 compared to $1,504,000 in 2015. The increase in 2016 of $406,000, or 27.0%, was primarily due to an increase in executive bonus compensation.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization was $1,125,000 in 2016 compared to $1,032,000 in 2015. The increase of $93,000, or 9.0%, in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to depreciation on newly purchased assets used to upgrade our systems infrastructure and the Kingston, New York home office building from which we operate.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense in 2016 was $4,518,000, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 33.7%. Income tax expense in 2015 was $3,349,000, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 32.5%. Income before taxes was $13,418,000 in 2016 compared to $10,309,000 in 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate by 1.2 percentage points in 2016 is primarily a result of permanent tax true ups from 2015.\nNet Income\nNet income was $8,900,000 in 2016 compared to $6,960,000 in 2015. The increase in net income of $1,940,000, or 27.9%, was due to the circumstances described above that caused the increase in our net premiums earned, net investment income, and a decrease in our net loss ratio, partially offset by a decrease in ceding commission revenue and other income, and by increases in other underwriting expenses related to premium growth and other operating expenses.\nAdditional Financial Information\nWe operate our business as one segment, property and casualty insurance. Within this segment, we offer a wide array of property and casualty policies to our producers. The following table summarizes gross and net premiums written, net premiums earned, and loss and loss adjustment expenses by major product type, which were determined based primarily on similar economic characteristics and risks of loss.\n\n__________________________________\n(1) See discussions above for Net Written Premiums and Net Premiums Earned, related to change in quota share ceding rate and change in catastrophe reinsurance from gross\u201d basis to net\u201d basis.\n(2) Effective October 1, 2014 we decided to no longer accept applications for new commercial auto coverage. In February 2015, we decided to no longer offer renewals to our existing commercial auto policies beginning with those that expired on or after May 1, 2015.\n(3) Other\u201d includes, among other things, premiums and loss and loss adjustment expenses from our participation in a mandatory state joint underwriting association.\nInsurance Underwriting Business on a Standalone Basis\nOur insurance underwriting business reported on a standalone basis for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 follows:\n\nAn analysis of our direct, assumed and ceded earned premiums, loss and loss adjustment expenses, and loss ratios is shown below:\n\nThe key measures for our insurance underwriting business for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:\n\n_________________________________________________\n(1) For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the effect of severe winter weather, defined as a catastrophe, reduced contingent ceding commission revenue by $-0- and $1,280,521, respectively.\n(2) For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, includes the sum of net catastrophe losses and loss adjustment expenses of $1,402,477 and $2,090,593, respectively, resulting from severe winter weather.\n(3) For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the effect of catastrophe loss from severe winter weather on our net combined ratio only includes the direct effects of loss and loss adjustment expenses and ceding commission revenue and does not include the indirect effects of a $84,149 and $324,906, respectively, decrease in other underwriting expenses.\nInvestments\nPortfolio Summary\nThe following table presents a breakdown of the amortized cost, aggregate fair value and unrealized gains and losses by investment type as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities\n\n\nHeld-to-Maturity Securities\n\n\nU.S. Treasury securities included in held-to-maturity securities are held in trust pursuant to the New York State Department of Financial Services' minimum funds requirement.\nA summary of the amortized cost and fair value of the Company's investments in held-to-maturity securities by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 is shown below:\n\nCredit Rating of Fixed-Maturity Securities\nThe table below summarizes the credit quality of our available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 as rated by Standard and Poor's (or, if unavailable from Standard and Poor's, then Moody's or Fitch):\n\nThe table below details the average yield by type of fixed-maturity security as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nThe table below lists the weighted average maturity and effective duration in years on our fixed-maturity securities as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nFair Value Consideration\nAs disclosed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with respect to Fair Value Measurements,\u201d we define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a transaction involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities between market participants (an exit price\u201d). The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between inputs based on market data from independent sources ( observable inputs\u201d) and a reporting entity's internal assumptions based upon the best information available when external market data is limited or unavailable ( unobservable inputs\u201d). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes fair value measurements into three levels based on the nature of the inputs. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets have the highest priority ( Level 1\u201d), followed by observable inputs other than quoted prices including prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities ( Level 2\u201d), and unobservable inputs, including the reporting entity's estimates of the assumption that market participants would use, having the lowest priority ( Level 3\u201d). As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 65% and 66%, respectively, of the investment portfolio recorded at fair value was priced based upon quoted market prices.\nAs more fully described in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Investments-Impairment Review,\u201d we completed a detailed review of all our securities in a continuous loss position as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016 our held-to-maturity debt securities included an investment in one bond issued by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ( PR\u201d). In July 2016, PR defaulted on its interest payment to bondholders. Due to the credit deterioration of PR, we recorded a credit loss component of other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) on this investment as of June 30, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the full amount of the write-down was recognized as a credit component of OTTI in the amount of $69,911 and is included as a reduction to net realized gains in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. We concluded that the other unrealized losses in these asset classes are temporary in nature and the result of a decrease in value due to technical spread widening and broader market sentiment, rather than fundamental collateral deterioration.\nThe table below summarizes the gross unrealized losses of our fixed-maturity securities available-for-sale and equity securities by length of time the security has continuously been in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\n\nThere were 85 securities at December 31, 2016 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss, none of which were deemed by us to be other than temporarily impaired. There were 57 securities at December 31, 2015 that accounted for the gross unrealized loss, none of which were deemed by us to be other than temporarily impaired. Significant factors influencing our determination that unrealized losses were temporary included the magnitude of the unrealized losses in relation to each security's cost, the nature of the investment and management's intent not to sell these securities and it being not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these investments before anticipated recovery of fair value to our cost basis.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe primary sources of cash flow are from our insurance underwriting subsidiary, KICO, and include direct premiums written, ceding commissions from our quota share reinsurers, loss recovery payments from our reinsurers, investment income and proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments. Funds are used by KICO for ceded premium payments to reinsurers, which are paid on a net basis after subtracting losses paid on reinsured claims and reinsurance commissions. KICO also uses funds for loss payments and loss adjustment expenses on our net business, commissions to producers, salaries and other underwriting expenses as well as to purchase investments and fixed assets.\nIn April 2016 we sold 595,238 newly issued shares of our common stock to RenaissanceRe Ventures Ltd., a subsidiary of RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:RNR) ( RenaissanceRe\u201d), in a private placement. RenaissanceRe is a global provider of catastrophe and specialty reinsurance and insurance. The new common shares were sold to RenaissanceRe at a price of $8.40 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $4,808,000 from the private placement. In June 2016, we invested $3,000,000 of the proceeds in KICO as additional surplus to support its continued growth. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds of the offering to support the continued growth of KICO, and for general corporate purposes.\nOn January 31, 2017, we closed on an underwritten public offering of 2,500,000 shares of our common stock. On February 14, 2017, we closed on the underwriters' 30-day purchase option for an additional 192,500 shares our common stock. The public offering price for the 2,692,500 shares sold was $12.00 per share. The aggregate net proceeds to us was approximately $30,230,000. On March 1, 2017, we used $23,000,000 of the net proceeds of the offering to contribute capital to KICO, to support its ratings upgrade plan and additional growth. The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.\nThrough December 31, 2016, the primary sources of cash flow for our holding company are dividends received from KICO, subject to statutory restrictions. For year ended December 31, 2016, KICO paid dividends of $1,950,000 to us.\nIf the aforementioned sources of cash flow currently available are insufficient to cover our holding company cash requirements, we will seek to obtain additional financing.\nOur reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operations is generally influenced by the collection of premiums in advance of paid losses, the timing of reinsurance, issuing company settlements and loss payments.\nCash flow and liquidity are categorized into three sources: (1) operating activities; (2) investing activities; and (3) financing activities, which are shown in the following table:\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15,201,000 in 2016 as compared to $20,402,000 provided in 2015. The $5,201,000 decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2016 was primarily a result of an increase in cash arising from net fluctuations in assets and liabilities relating to operating activities of KICO as affected by the growth in its operations which are described above, and an increase in net income (adjusted for non-cash items) of $1,485,000.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $19,516,000 in 2016 compared to $14,902,000 used in 2015. The $4,614,000 increase in cash used in investing activities is the result of a $21,097,000 increase in acquisitions of invested assets, offset by a $684,000 reduction in the amount of fixed asset acquisitions in 2016 and collection of a $250,000 note receivable included in other assets, and a $15,559,000 increase in sales or maturities of invested assets.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $2,808,000 in 2016 compared to $1,855,000 used in 2015. The $4,663,000 increase in cash provided by financing activities is the result of the $4,808,000 net proceeds we received from the private placement of our common stock in April 2016 and a $164,000 decrease in the purchase of treasury stock, offset partially by a $384,000 increase in dividends paid due an increase in the dividend rate and shares outstanding.\nReinsurance\nThe following table provides summary information with respect to each reinsurer that accounted for more than 10% of our reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2016:\n\nReinsurance recoverable from Maiden Reinsurance Company and Motors Insurance Corporation (included in Others) are secured pursuant to collateralized trust agreements. Assets held in the two trusts are not included in our invested assets and investment income earned on these assets is credited to the two reinsurers respectively.\nOur quota share reinsurance treaties are on a July 1 through June 30 fiscal year basis; therefore, for year to date fiscal periods after June 30, two separate treaties will be included in such periods.\nOur quota share reinsurance treaties in effect for the year ended December 31, 2016 for our personal lines business, which primarily consists of homeowners' policies, were covered under the 2015/2016 Treaty and the 2016/2017 Treaty. Our quota share reinsurance treaties in effect for the year ended December 31, 2015 for our personal lines business, which primarily consists of homeowners' policies, were covered under the 2014/2015 Treaty and the 2015/2016 Treaty.\nOur personal lines quota share treaty that covered the July 1, 2013/June 30, 2014 treaty year was a two year treaty that expired on June 30, 2015. Effective July 1, 2014, we exercised our contractual option to reduce the ceding percentage in the personal lines quota share treaty from 75% to 55%.\nOur 2014/2015 Treaty, 2015/2016 Treaty and 2016/2017 Treaty provide for the following material terms:\n\n1.\nPlus losses in excess of catastrophe coverage.\n2.\nCatastrophe coverage is limited on an annual basis to two times the per occurrence amounts. Effective July 1, 2016, the duration of a catastrophe occurrence from windstorm, hail, tornado, hurricane and cyclone was extended to 168 consecutive hours from 120 consecutive hours.\n3.\nFrom July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2016, catastrophe treaty also covered losses caused by severe winter weather during any consecutive 28 day period.\n4.\nEffective July 1, 2015, reinstatement premium protection for $16,000,000 of catastrophe coverage in excess of $4,000,000. Effective July 1, 2016, reinstatement premium protection for $20,000,000 of catastrophe coverage in excess of $5,000,000.\nThe single maximum risks per occurrence to which we are subject under the new treaties effective July 1, 2016 are as follows:\n\n_________\n(1) Covered by excess of loss treaties.\n(2) Catastrophe coverage is limited on an annual basis to two times the per occurrence amounts.\nThe single maximum risks per occurrence to which we are subject under the treaties that expired on June 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:\n\n_______________\n(1) Covered by excess of loss treaties.\n(2) Catastrophe coverage is limited on an annual basis to two times the per occurrence amounts.\nInflation\nPremiums are established before we know the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses or the extent to which inflation may affect such amounts. We attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in establishing our reserves, especially as it relates to medical and hospital rates where historical inflation rates have exceeded the general level of inflation. Inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and loss adjustment expenses to be higher than we anticipated, which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings.\nFluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates, which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new investments. Operating expenses, including salaries and benefits, generally are impacted by inflation.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, or liquidity that are material to investors.\nFactors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition\nBased upon the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. These factors, among others, may affect the accuracy of certain forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nAs a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events.\nBecause of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events (such as Superstorm Sandy), our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, severe winter weather, storms and certain types of terrorism. We have catastrophe reinsurance coverage with regard to losses of up to $252,000,000. The initial $5,000,000 of losses in a catastrophe are subject to a 40% quota share reinsurance treaty, such that we retain $3,000,000 of risk per catastrophe occurrence. With respect to any additional catastrophe losses of up to $247,000,000, we are 100% reinsured under our catastrophe reinsurance program. Catastrophe coverage is limited on an annual basis to two times the per occurrence amounts. We may incur catastrophe losses in excess of: (i) those that we project would be incurred, (ii) those that external modeling firms estimate would be incurred, (iii) the average expected level used in pricing or (iv) our current reinsurance coverage limits. Despite our catastrophe management programs, we are exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which may result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our financial strength ratings. In addition, the reinsurance losses that are incurred in connection with a catastrophe could have an adverse impact on the terms and conditions of future reinsurance treaties.\nIn addition, we are subject to claims arising from non-catastrophic weather events such as hurricanes, tropical storms, severe winter weather, rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of claims when severe weather conditions occur.\nUnanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in the severity or frequency of claims may affect our profitability. Changes in homeowners claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry, in building materials and home furnishings, and by other economic and environmental factors, including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes. Changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy and by litigation costs. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, prices of auto parts and used car prices. However, changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict, such as a change in the law or an inability to enforce exclusions and limitations contained in our policies. Although we pursue various loss management initiatives to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity, and a significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe inability to obtain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best, or a downgrade in our rating, may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, the marketability of our product offerings, and our liquidity, operating results and financial condition.\nFinancial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company's business. Many insurance buyers, agents, brokers and secured lenders use the ratings assigned by A.M. Best and other agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies with which they do business or from which they are considering purchasing insurance or in determining the financial strength of the company that provides insurance with respect to the collateral they hold. KICO currently has an A.M. Best financial strength rating of B++ (Good). A.M. Best ratings are derived from an in-depth evaluation of an insurance company's balance sheet strengths, operating performances and business profiles. A.M. Best evaluates, among other factors, the company's capitalization, underwriting leverage, financial leverage, asset leverage, capital structure, quality and appropriateness of reinsurance, adequacy of reserves, quality and diversification of assets, liquidity, profitability, spread of risk, revenue composition, market position, management, market risk and event risk. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies such as A.M. Best review the financial performance and condition of insurers and can downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer's ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurer's statutory capital, a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the insurer's control. KICO currently has a Demotech financial stability rating of A (Exceptional), which generally makes its policies acceptable to mortgage lenders that require homeowners to purchase insurance. All ratings are subject to continuous review; therefore, the retention of these ratings cannot be assured. The inability to obtain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best or a downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our competitiveness, the marketability of our product offerings and our ability to grow in the marketplace.\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms.\nThe capital and credit markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. In some cases, markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity. In the event that we need access to additional capital to support our operating expenses, make payments on any future indebtedness, pay for capital expenditures, or increase the amount of insurance that we seek to underwrite or to otherwise grow our business, our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant. Our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to our industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity as well as lenders' perception of our long or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If a combination of these factors occurs, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient and, in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms.\nWe are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and our net investment income can vary from period to period.\nWe are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, equity prices, market volatility, general economic conditions, the performance of the specific obligors included in our portfolio, and other factors outside our control. Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. Our investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive instruments, such as fixed income securities, which may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates from governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. A rise in interest rates would increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio, which would be offset by our ability to earn higher rates of return on funds reinvested. Conversely, a decline in interest rates would decrease the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio, which would be offset by lower rates of return on funds reinvested.\nIn addition, market volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent. As such, valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. If significant, continued volatility, changes in interest rates, changes in defaults, a lack of pricing transparency, market liquidity and declines in equity prices, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, impairments, and changes in unrealized positions.\nReinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business or to obtain and maintain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best.\nOur personal lines catastrophe reinsurance program was designed, utilizing our risk management methodology, to address our exposure to catastrophes. Market conditions beyond our control impact the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be given that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as currently available. For example, our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk may be dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for its cost, and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our current reinsurance program will continue to be available in the future. If we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we will have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk, reduce our insurance writings or seek other alternatives. Our ability to obtain and maintain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best depends, in part, on our ability to purchase additional catastrophe reinsurance.\nWe intend to prudently reduce our reliance on quota share reinsurance, in part to obtain and maintain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best; this would lead to greater exposure to net insurance losses.\nWe have determined it to be in the best interests of our shareholders to prudently reduce our reliance on quota share reinsurance. Our ability to obtain and maintain an upgrade to our financial strength rating from A.M. Best depends, in part, on reducing the amount of premium ceded to reinsurers under our quota share reinsurance treaty. Any such reduction would result in higher earned premiums and a reduction in ceding commission revenue in future years. Such reduction would also lead to increased exposure to net insurance losses.\nReinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including changes in market conditions, whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. Since we are primarily liable to an insured for the full amount of insurance coverage, our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nApplicable insurance laws regarding the change of control of our company may impede potential acquisitions that our shareholders might consider to be desirable.\nWe are subject to statutes and regulations of the state of New York which generally require that any person or entity desiring to acquire direct or indirect control of KICO, our insurance company subsidiary, obtain prior regulatory approval. In addition, a change of control of Kingstone Companies, Inc. would require such approval. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of our company, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions. Some of our shareholders might consider such transactions to be desirable. Similar regulations may apply in other states in which we may operate.\nThe insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation that may affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business, and changes within this regulatory environment may adversely affect our operating costs and limit the growth of our business.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations. State insurance regulators are charged with protecting policyholders and have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers over our business practices. These include, among other things, the power to grant and revoke licenses to transact business and the power to regulate and approve underwriting practices and rate changes, which may delay the implementation of premium rate changes or prevent us from making changes we believe are necessary to match rate to risk. In addition, many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer's ability to cancel or not renew policies and that prohibit an insurer from withdrawing from one or more lines of business written in the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by state regulatory authorities. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets.\nBecause the laws and regulations under which we operate are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, including state insurance regulators, state securities administrators and the SEC, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another's interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal and regulatory environment may, even absent any particular regulator's or enforcement authority's interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding he actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thereby necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and/or to improve the profitability of our business.\nWhile the United States federal government does not directly regulate the insurance industry, federal legislation and administrative policies can affect us. Congress and various federal agencies periodically discuss proposals that would provide for a federal charter for insurance companies. We cannot predict whether any such laws will be enacted or the effect that such laws would have on our business. Moreover, there can be no assurance that changes will not be made to current laws, rules and regulations, or that any other laws, rules or regulations will not be adopted in the future, that could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to maintain the requisite amount of risk-based capital, which may adversely affect our profitability and our ability to compete in the property and casualty insurance markets.\nThe DFS imposes risk-based capital requirements on insurance companies to ensure that insurance companies maintain appropriate levels of surplus to support their overall business operations and to protect customers against adverse developments, after taking into account default, credit, underwriting, reserve and off-balance sheet risks. If the amount of our capital falls below certain thresholds, we may face restrictions with respect to soliciting new business and/or keeping existing business. Similar regulations will apply in other states in which we may operate.\nChanging climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, profitability or cash flows.\nWe recognize the scientific view that the world is getting warmer. Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency and/or severity of weather events and affect the affordability and availability of homeowners insurance.\nOur operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business.\nThe property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. A downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nBecause substantially all of our revenue is currently derived from sources located in New York, our business may be adversely affected by conditions in such state.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is currently derived from sources located in the state of New York and, accordingly, is affected by the prevailing regulatory, economic, demographic, competitive and other conditions in the state. Changes in any of these conditions could make it more costly or difficult for us to conduct our business. Adverse regulatory developments in New York, which could include fundamental changes to the design or implementation of the insurance regulatory framework, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are highly dependent on a small number of insurance brokers for a large portion of our revenues.\nWe market our insurance products primarily through insurance brokers. A large percentage of our gross premiums written are sourced through a limited number of brokers. These brokers provided a total of 36.5% of our gross premiums written for the year ended December 31, 2016. The nature of our dependency on these brokers relates to the high volume of business they consistently refer to us. Our relationship with these brokers is based on the quality of the underwriting and claims services we provide to our clients and on our financial strength ratings. Any deterioration in these factors could result in these brokers advising clients to place their risks with other insurers rather than with us. A loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory action taken by the New York State Department of Financial Services following Superstorm Sandy may affect our operations and business.\nIn the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, the DFS has adopted various regulations that affect insurance companies that operate in the state of New York. Included among the regulations are accelerated claims investigation and settlement requirements and mandatory participation in non-binding mediation proceedings funded by the insurer. In settling insurance claims, including those related to Superstorm Sandy, if KICO were to pay for losses not covered by the insurance policy, such as those based on water and sewer back up claims, it could face disclaimers of coverage from its reinsurers with regard to the amounts paid.\nActual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nRecorded claim reserves for our business are based on our best estimates of losses after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances. Internal and external factors are considered. Internal factors include, but are not limited to, actual claims paid, pending levels of unpaid claims, product mix and contractual terms. External factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the law, court decisions, changes in regulatory requirements and economic conditions. Because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves, and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on the results of operations of our subsidiary KICO; there are restrictions on the payment of dividends by KICO.\nWe are a holding company and a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiary, KICO. As a holding company with limited operations of our own, currently the principal sources of our funds are dividends and other payments from KICO. Consequently, we must rely on KICO for our ability to repay debts, pay expenses and pay cash dividends to our shareholders.\nOur ability to receive dividends from KICO is restricted by the state laws and insurance regulations of New York. These restrictions are related to surplus and net investment income. Maximum permissible dividends are restricted to the lesser of 10% of surplus or 100% of net investment income (on a statutory accounting basis) for the trailing 36 months, less dividends paid by KICO during such period. As of December 31, 2016, the maximum permissible distribution that KICO could pay without prior regulatory approval was approximately $4,385,000.\nOur future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive.\nThe insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have well-established national reputations, substantially more capital and significantly greater marketing and management resources. Because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, including competition for customers, agents and brokers, there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and to maintain profitable operating results or financial condition.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our ability to implement our business strategies could be delayed or hindered.\nOur future success will depend, in part, upon the efforts of Barry Goldstein, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Benjamin Walden, Executive Vice President and Chief Actuary of KICO. The loss of Mr. Goldstein, Mr. Walden or other key personnel could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategies and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we continue to grow, we will need to recruit and retain additional qualified management personnel, but we may not be able to do so. Our ability to recruit and retain such personnel will depend upon a number of factors, such as our results of operations and prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel. Mr. Goldstein is a party to an employment agreement with us that expires on December 31, 2019. Mr. Walden is not a party to an employment agreement with KICO.\nDifficult conditions in the economy generally could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs with most businesses, we believe that difficult conditions in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. General economic conditions also could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior, which may include decreased demand for our products. As consumers become more cost conscious, they may choose lower levels of insurance.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles, which are periodically revised, interpreted and/or expanded. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new guidance or interpretations, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition that is either unexpected or has a greater impact than expected.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or those of one or more of our vendors.\nOur business requires that we develop and maintain computer systems to run our operations and to store a significant volume of confidential data. Some of these systems rely on third-party vendors, through either a connection to, or an integration with, those third-parties' systems. In the course of our operations, we acquire the personal confidential information of our customers and employees. We also store our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business and financial information.\nAll of these systems are subject to cyber attacks\u201d by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities, and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees, consultants, agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems. Such attacks or actions may include attempts to:\n\u25cf steal, corrupt, or destroy data, including our intellectual property, financial data or the personal information of our customers or employees\n\u25cf misappropriate funds\n\u25cf disrupt or shut down our systems\n\u25cf deny customers, agents, brokers, or others access to our systems, or\n\u25cf infect our systems with viruses or malware.\nWhile we can take defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun. Our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack. In addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen. In addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations. We have a cyber insurance policy to protect against the monetary impact of some of these risks. However, the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber-attack, if sufficiently severe, could have a material adverse effect on our business results.\nWe rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems, and the failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems. We rely on these systems to support our operations. The failure of these systems could interrupt our operations and result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, increased costs as a result of being an SEC reporting company.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as a variety of related rules implemented by the SEC, have required changes in corporate governance practices and generally increased the disclosure requirements of public companies. As a reporting company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with our public disclosure and other obligations. Based upon SEC regulations currently in effect, we are required to establish, evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. We believe that compliance with the myriad of rules and regulations applicable to reporting companies and related compliance issues will require a significant amount of time and attention from our management.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly and be highly volatile and this may make it difficult for shareholders to resell shares of our common stock at the volume, prices and times they find attractive.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations and be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for shareholders to resell shares of our common stock at the volume, prices and times they find attractive. There are many factors that will impact our stock price and trading volume, including, but not limited to, the factors listed above under Risks Related to Our Business.\u201d\nStock markets, in general, have experienced in recent years, and continue to experience, significant price and volume volatility, and the market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations that may be unrelated to our operating performance and prospects. Increased market volatility and fluctuations could result in a substantial decline in the market price of our common stock.\nThe trading volume in our common stock has been limited. As a result, shareholders may not experience liquidity in their investment in our common stock, thereby potentially limiting their ability to resell their shares at the volume, times and prices they find attractive.\nOur common stock is currently traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market. Our common stock has substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for many other publicly traded insurance and other companies. An active trading market for our common stock may not develop or, if developed, may not be sustained. Such stocks can be more volatile than stocks trading in an active public market. Therefore, shareholders have reduced liquidity and may not be able to sell their shares at the volume, prices and times that they desire.\nThere may be future issuances or resales of our common stock which may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSubject to any required state insurance regulatory approvals, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock in the future, including securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock. Our issuance of additional shares of common stock in the future will dilute the ownership interests of our then existing shareholders.\nWe have effective registrations on Form S-3 under the Securities Act registering for resale an aggregate of 1,254,238 shares of our common stock and effective registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act registering an aggregate of 700,000 shares of our common stock issuable under our 2005 Equity Participation Plan and an aggregate of 700,000 shares of our common stock issuable under our 2014 Equity Participation Plan. Options to purchase 267,750 shares of our common stock are outstanding under the 2005 plan. Options to purchase 90,000 shares of our common stock are outstanding under the 2014 plan and 578,500 shares are reserved for issuance thereunder. We have also registered up to $9,290,000 of our securities pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 which we may sell from time to time in one or more offerings. The shares subject to the registration statements on Form S-3 will be freely tradeable in the public market. In addition, the shares issuable pursuant to the registration statements on Form S-8 will be freely tradable in the public market, except for shares held by affiliates.\nThe sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock, whether directly by us or selling shareholders in future offerings or by our existing shareholders in the secondary market, the perception that such issuances or resales could occur or the availability for future issuances or resale of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of our common stock could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities on attractive terms or at all.\nIn addition, our board of directors is authorized to designate and issue preferred stock without further shareholder approval, and we may issue other equity and equity-related securities that are senior to our common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, to support operations and growth, to maintain our capital ratios, and to comply with any future changes in regulatory standards.\nOur executive officers and directors own a substantial number of shares of our common stock. This will enable them to significantly influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders.\nAs of March 16, 2017, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned 1,266,659 shares of our common stock (including options to purchase 217,500 shares of our common stock), representing 11.7% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.\nAccordingly, our executive officers and directors, through their beneficial ownership of our common stock, will be able to significantly influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including the election of directors, amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, mergers or other business combination transactions and certain sales of assets outside the usual and regular course of business. The interests of our executive officers and directors may not coincide with the interests of our other shareholders, and they could take actions that advance their own interests to the detriment of our other shareholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions and the regulations to which we may be subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nWe are a holding company incorporated in Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as regulatory approvals required under state insurance laws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent shareholders from receiving a premium for their shares of common stock. Our certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors may issue up to 2,500,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, without shareholder approval and with such terms, preferences, rights and privileges as the board of directors may deem appropriate. These provisions, the control of our executive officers and directors over the election of our directors, and other factors may hinder or prevent a change in control, even if the change in control would be beneficial to, or sought by, our shareholders.", "item_7_tables": "Table 16: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ($ in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td>
