Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(All figures in this item are in thousands except share, per share and other data.)\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from any results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere herein.\nOverview\nThe terms Prospect,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d mean Prospect Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.\nProspect is a financial services company that primarily lends to and invests in middle-market privately-held companies. We are a closed-end investment company incorporated in Maryland. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act\u201d). As a BDC, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d), under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code\u201d). We were organized on April 13, 2004 and were funded in an initial public offering completed on July 27, 2004.\nOn May 15, 2007, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary Prospect Capital Funding LLC ( PCF\u201d), a Delaware limited liability company and a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which holds certain of our portfolio loan investments that are used as collateral for the revolving credit facility at PCF. Our wholly owned subsidiary Prospect Small Business Lending, LLC ( PSBL\u201d) was formed on January 27, 2014, and purchased small business whole loans from online small business loan originators, including On Deck Capital, Inc. ( OnDeck\u201d). On September 30, 2014, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary Prospect Yield Corporation, LLC ( PYC\u201d) and effective October 23, 2014, PYC holds a portion of our collateralized loan obligations ( CLOs\u201d), which we also refer to as subordinated structured notes ( SSNs\u201d). Each of these subsidiaries have been consolidated since operations commenced.\nWe consolidate certain of our wholly owned and substantially wholly owned holding companies formed by us in order to facilitate our investment strategy. The following companies are included in our consolidated financial statements and are collectively referred to as the Consolidated Holding Companies\u201d: CP Holdings of Delaware LLC ( CP Holdings\u201d); Credit Central Holdings of Delaware, LLC ( Credit Central Delaware\u201d); Energy Solutions Holdings Inc.; First Tower Holdings of Delaware LLC ( First Tower Delaware\u201d); MITY Holdings of Delaware Inc. ( MITY Delaware\u201d); Nationwide Acceptance Holdings LLC; NMMB Holdings, Inc. ( NMMB Holdings\u201d); NPH Property Holdings, LLC ( NPH\u201d); Prospect Opportunity Holdings I, Inc. ( POHI\u201d); SB Forging Company, Inc. ( SB Forging\u201d); STI Holding, Inc.; UTP Holdings Group Inc. ( UTP Holdings\u201d); Valley Electric Holdings I, Inc.( Valley Holdings I\u201d); and Valley Electric Holdings II, Inc. ( Valley Holdings II\u201d).\nWe are externally managed by our investment adviser, Prospect Capital Management L.P. ( Prospect Capital Management\u201d or the Investment Adviser\u201d). Prospect Administration LLC ( Prospect Administration\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Investment Adviser, provides administrative services and facilities necessary for us to operate.\nOur investment objective is to generate both current income and long-term capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in senior and subordinated secured debt and equity of private companies in need of capital for acquisitions, divestitures, growth, development, recapitalizations and other purposes. We work with the management teams or financial sponsors to seek investments with historical cash flows, asset collateral or contracted pro-forma cash flows.\nWe currently have four primary strategies that guide our origination of investment opportunities: (1) lending to companies, including companies controlled by private equity sponsors and not controlled by private equity sponsors, and including both directly-originated loans and syndicated loans, (2) lending to companies and purchasing controlling equity positions in such companies, including both operating companies and financial services companies, (3) purchasing controlling equity positions and lending to real estate companies, and (4) investing in structured credit. We may also invest in other strategies and opportunities from time to time that we view as attractive. We continue to evaluate other origination strategies in the ordinary course of business with no specific top-down allocation to any single origination strategy.\nLending to Companies - We make directly-originated agented loans to companies, including companies which are controlled by private equity sponsors and companies that are not controlled by private equity sponsors (such as companies that are controlled by the management team, the founder, a family or public shareholders). This debt can take the form of first lien, second lien, unitranche or unsecured loans. These loans typically have equity subordinate to our loan position. We may also purchase selected equity co-investments in such companies. In addition to directly-originated, agented loans, we also invest in senior and secured loans, syndicated loans and high yield bonds that have been sold to a club or syndicate of buyers, both in the primary and secondary markets. These investments are often purchased with a long term, buy-and-hold outlook, and we often look to provide significant input to the transaction by providing anchoring orders. Historically, this strategy has compromised approximately 40%-60% of our portfolio.\nLending to Companies and Purchasing Controlling Equity Positions in Such Companies - This strategy involves purchasing senior and secured yield-producing debt and controlling equity positions in operating companies across various industries. We believe this strategy provides enhanced certainty of closure to sellers and the opportunity for management to continue on in their current roles. These investments are often structured in tax-efficient partnerships, enhancing returns. Historically, this strategy has comprised approximately 15%-25% of our portfolio.\nPurchasing Controlling Equity Positions and Lending to Real Estate Companies - We purchase debt and controlling equity positions in tax-efficient real estate investment trusts ( REIT\u201d or REITs\u201d). The real estate investments of National Property REIT Corp. ( NPRC\u201d) are in various classes of developed and occupied real estate properties that generate current yields, including multi-family properties, and student housing. NPRC seeks to identify properties that have historically significant occupancy rates and recurring cash flow generation. NPRC generally co-invests with established and experienced property management teams that manage such properties after acquisition. Additionally, NPRC makes investments in rated secured structured notes (primarily debt of structured credit). NPRC also purchases loans originated by certain consumer loan facilitators. It purchases each loan in its entirety (i.e., a whole loan\u201d). The borrowers are consumers, and the loans are typically serviced by the facilitators of the loans. Historically, this overall investment strategy has comprised approximately 10%-20% of our business.\nInvesting in Structured Credit - We make investments in structured credit, often taking a significant position in subordinated structured notes (equity) and rated secured structured notes (debt). The underlying portfolio of each structured credit investment is diversified across approximately 100 to 200 broadly syndicated loans and does not have direct exposure to real estate, mortgages, or consumer-based credit assets. The structured credit portfolios in which we invest are managed by established collateral management teams with many years of experience in the industry. Historically, this overall strategy has comprised approximately 10%-20% of our portfolio.\nWe invest primarily in first and second lien secured loans and unsecured debt, which in some cases includes an equity component. First and second lien secured loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of unsecured debt of a given portfolio company. These loans also have the benefit of security interests on the assets of the portfolio company, which may rank ahead of or be junior to other security interests. Our investments in structured credit are subordinated to senior loans and are generally unsecured. We invest in debt and equity positions of structured credit which are a form of securitization in which the cash flows of a portfolio of loans are pooled and passed on to different classes of owners in various tranches. Our structured credit investments are derived from portfolios of corporate debt securities which are generally risk rated from BB to B.\nWe hold many of our control investments in a two-tier structure consisting of a holding company and one or more related operating companies for tax purposes. These holding companies serve various business purposes including concentration of management teams, optimization of third party borrowing costs, improvement of supplier, customer, and insurance terms, and enhancement of co-investments by the management teams. In these cases, our investment, which is generally equity in the holding company, the holding company's equity investment in the operating company and any debt from us directly to the operating company structure represents our total exposure for the investment. As of June 30, 2021, as shown in our Consolidated Schedule of Investments, the cost basis and fair value of our investments in controlled companies was $2,482,431 and $2,919,717, respectively. This structure gives rise to several of the risks described in our public documents and highlighted elsewhere in this Annual Report. We consolidate all wholly-owned and substantially wholly-owned holding companies formed by us for the purpose of holding our controlled investments in operating companies. There is no significant effect of consolidating these holding companies as they hold minimal assets other than their investments in the controlled operating companies. Investment company accounting prohibits the consolidation of any operating companies.\nOn June 11, 2021, at a special meeting of stockholders, our stockholders authorized us to sell shares of our common stock (during the next 12 months) at a price or prices below our net asset value per share at the time of sale in one or more offerings subject to certain conditions as set forth in the proxy statement relating to the special meeting (including that the number of shares sold on any given date does not exceed 25% of its outstanding common stock immediately prior to such sale).\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nInvestment Transactions\nWe seek to be a long-term investor with our portfolio companies. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, we acquired $163,168 of new investments, completed follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies totaling approximately $126,420, funded $316 of revolver advances, and recorded PIK interest of $16,771, resulting in gross investment originations of $306,675. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, we received full repayments on investments totaling $105,537, received $50,727 in partial prepayments, and revolver paydowns of $8, resulting in net repayments of $156,272.\nDebt Issuances and Redemptions\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2021, we repaid $1,817 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae at par in accordance with the Survivor's Option, as defined in the InterNotes\u00ae Offering prospectus. In order to replace short maturity debt with longer-term debt, we redeemed $241,580 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae at par with a weighted average interest rate of 4.87%. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a loss in the amount of the unamortized debt issuance costs. The net loss on the extinguishment of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae in the three months ended June 30, 2021 was $2,997.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2021, we issued $78,828 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae with a weighted average stated interest rate of 3.50%, to extend our borrowing base. The newly issued notes mature between April 15, 2026 and July 15, 2033 and generated net proceeds of $77,359.\nOn March 16, 2021, we commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash up to $30,000 aggregate principal outstanding amount of the 2022 Notes at the purchase price of $102.00, plus accrued and unpaid interest ( 2022 Notes March 2021 Tender Offer\u201d). On April 13, 2021, $50 aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes, representing 0.05% of the previously outstanding 2022 Notes, were validly tendered and accepted. The 2022 Notes March 2021 Tender Offer resulted in our recognizing a loss of $1.\nOn April 28, 2021, we amended the 2019 Facility and closed an expanded five year revolving credit facility (the 2021 Facility\u201d and collectively with the 2014 Facility, the 2018 Facility and the 2019 Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The lenders had extended commitments of $1,107,500 as of June 30, 2021. The Revolving Credit Facility includes an accordion feature which allows commitments to be increased up to $1,500,000 in the aggregate. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on April 27, 2026. It includes a revolving period that extends through April 27, 2025, followed by an additional one-year amortization period, with distributions allowed to Prospect after the completion of the revolving period. During such one-year amortization period, all principal payments on the pledged assets will be applied to reduce the balance. At the end of the one-year amortization period, the remaining balance will become due, if required by the lenders.\nOn April 7, 2021, we commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash up to $30,000 aggregate principal amount of the 6.375% 2024 Notes at the purchase price of $107.50, plus accrued and unpaid interest ( 6.375% 2024 Notes April 2021 Tender Offer\u201d). On May 4, 2021, $226 aggregate principal amount of the 6.375% 2024 notes, representing 0.28% of the previously outstanding 6.375% 2024 Notes, were validly tendered and accepted. The 6.375% 2024 Notes April 2021 Tender Offer resulted in our recognizing a loss of $18 during the three months ended June 30, 2021.\nOn April 7, 2021, we commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash up to $30,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes at the purchase price of $104.15, plus accrued and unpaid interest ( 2023 Notes April 2021 Tender Offer\u201d). On May 4, 2021, $836 aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes were tendered, representing 0.29% of the previously outstanding 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes April 2021 Tender Offer resulted in our recognizing a loss of $43 during the three months ended June 30, 2021.\nOn May 27, 2021, we issued $300,000 aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on November 15, 2026 (the 3.364% 2026 Notes\u201d). The 3.364% 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.364% per year, payable semi-annually on November 15, and May 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2021. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 3.364% 2026 Notes, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, were $293,283. As of June 30, 2021, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 3.364% 2026 Notes is $300,000.\nOn June 15, 2021, we redeemed $70,761 of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes. The transaction resulted in our recognizing a loss of $1,934 during the three months ended June 30, 2021. Following the redemption, none of the 2028 Notes remained outstanding.\nEquity Issuances\nOn April 22, 2021, May 20, 2021, and June 17, 2021, we issued 357,521, 344,487, and 317,011 shares of our common stock in connection with the dividend reinvestment plan, respectively.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2021, we issued 2,508,672 shares of our Series A1 Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $57,182, 187,000 shares of our Series A2 Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $4,208, and 108,897 shares of our Series M1 Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $2,662, each excluding offering costs and preferred stock dividend reinvestments.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2021, we issued 1,000 shares of our Series A1 Preferred Stock and 9 shares of our Series M1 Preferred Stock in connection with the preferred stock dividend reinvestment plan.\nInvestment Holdings\nAt June 30, 2021, we have $6,201,778, or 157.2%, of our net assets invested in 124 long-term portfolio investments and CLOs.\nOur annualized current yield was 11.7% and 11.4% as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively, across all performing interest bearing investments, excluding equity investments and non-accrual loans. Our annualized current yield was 9.2% and 9.7% as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively, across all investments. Monetization of equity positions that we hold and loans on non-accrual status are not included in this yield calculation. In many of our portfolio companies we hold equity positions, ranging from minority interests to majority stakes, which we expect over time to contribute to our investment returns. Some of these equity positions include features such as contractual minimum internal rates of returns, preferred distributions, flip structures and other features expected to generate additional investment returns, as well as contractual protections and preferences over junior equity, in addition to the yield and security offered by our cash flow and collateral debt protections.\nWe are a non-diversified company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. As required by the 1940 Act, we classify our investments by level of control. As defined in the 1940 Act, Control Investments\u201d are those where there is the ability or power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company. Control is generally deemed to exist when a company or individual possesses or has the right to acquire within 60 days or less, a beneficial ownership of 25% or more of the voting securities of an investee company. Under the 1940 Act, Affiliate Investments\u201d are defined by a lesser degree of influence and are deemed to exist through the possession outright or via the right to acquire within 60 days or less, beneficial ownership of 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of another person. Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments\u201d are those that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we own controlling interests in the following portfolio companies: CP Energy Services Inc. ( CP Energy\u201d); Credit Central Loan Company, LLC ( Credit Central\u201d); Echelon Transportation, LLC ( Echelon\u201d); First Tower Finance Company LLC ( First Tower Finance\u201d); Freedom Marine Solutions, LLC ( Freedom Marine\u201d); InterDent, Inc. ( InterDent\u201d); Kickapoo Ranch Pet Resort ( Kickapoo\u201d); MITY, Inc. ( MITY\u201d); NPRC; Nationwide Loan Company LLC ( Nationwide\u201d); NMMB, Inc. ( NMMB\u201d); Pacific World Corporation ( Pacific World\u201d); R-V Industries, Inc. ( R-V\u201d); Universal Turbine Parts, LLC ( UTP\u201d); USES Corp. ( United States Environmental Services\u201d or USES\u201d); and Valley Electric Company, Inc. ( Valley Electric\u201d). In June 2019, CP Energy purchased controlling interest of the common equity of Spartan Energy Holdings, Inc. ( Spartan Holdings\u201d), which owns 100% of Spartan Energy Services, LLC ( Spartan\u201d), a portfolio company of Prospect with $15,656 in senior secured term loans (the Spartan Term Loan A\u201d) due to us as of June 30, 2021. As a result of CP Energy's purchase, and given Prospect's controlling interest in CP Energy, we report our investments in Spartan as control investment. Spartan remains the direct borrow and guarantor to Prospect for the Spartan Term Loan A.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we also own affiliated interests in Nixon, Inc. ( Nixon\u201d), PGX Holdings, Inc. ( PGX\u201d), RGIS Services, LLC ( RGIS\u201d), and Targus Cayman HoldCo Limited ( Targus\u201d).\nThe following shows the composition of our investment portfolio by level of control as of June 30,

In addition, Revolving Line of Credit and Delayed Draw Term Loans are excluded from the calculation.\nInvestment Valuation\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, management and the independent valuation firm look at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. In determining the range of values for debt instruments where market quotations are not available, except CLOs and debt investments in controlling portfolio companies, management and the independent valuation firm estimated corporate and security credit ratings and identified corresponding yields to maturity for each loan from relevant market data. A discounted cash flow technique was then applied using the appropriate yield to maturity as the discount rate, to determine a range of values. In determining the range of values for debt investments of controlled companies and equity investments, the enterprise value was determined by applying a market approach such as using earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) multiples, net income and/or book value multiples for similar guideline public companies and/or similar recent investment transactions and/or an income approach, such as the discounted cash flow technique. The enterprise value technique may also be used to value debt investments which are credit impaired. For stressed debt and equity investments, asset recovery analysis was used.\nIn determining the range of values for our investments in CLOs, the independent valuation firm uses a discounted multi-path cash flow model. The valuations were accomplished through the analysis of the CLO deal structures to identify the risk exposures from the modeling point of view as well as to determine an appropriate call date (i.e., expected maturity). These risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations, which are simulations used to model the probability of different outcomes, to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows for the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market and certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment. In addition, we generate a single-path cash flow utilizing our best estimate of expected cash receipts, and assess the reasonableness of the implied discount rate that would be effective for the value derived from the corresponding multi-path cash flow model.\nWith respect to our online consumer and SME lending initiative, we invest primarily in marketplace loans through marketplace lending platforms. We do not conduct loan origination activities ourselves. Therefore, our ability to purchase consumer and SME loans, and our ability to grow our portfolio of consumer and SME loans, are directly influenced by the business performance and competitiveness of the marketplace loan origination business of the marketplace lending platforms from which we purchase consumer and SME loans. In addition, our ability to analyze the risk-return profile of consumer and SME loans is significantly dependent on the marketplace platforms' ability to effectively evaluate a borrower's credit profile and likelihood of default. If we are unable to effectively evaluate borrowers' credit profiles or the credit decisioning and scoring models implemented by each platform, we may incur unanticipated losses which could adversely impact our operating results.\nThe Board of Directors looked at several factors in determining where within the range to value the asset including: recent operating and financial trends for the asset, independent ratings obtained from third parties, comparable multiples for recent sales of companies within the industry and discounted cash flow models for our investments in CLOs. The composite of all these various valuation techniques, applied to each investment, was a total valuation of $6,201,778.\nOur portfolio companies are generally lower middle-market companies, outside of the financial sector, with less than $100,000 of annual EBITDA. We believe our investment portfolio has experienced less volatility than others because we believe there are more buy and hold investors who own these less liquid investments.\nImpact of the novel coronavirus (the COVID-19\u201d) pandemic\nAs of June 30, 2021, there remains to be global uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused severe disruptions in the global economy and has negatively impacted the fair value and performance of certain investments since the pandemic began. For the year ended June 30, 2021, the aggregate increases in fair value and net unrealized appreciation on investments were driven by the expansion of comparable company trading multiples and/or tightened credit spreads as the level of market volatility generated by the COVID-19 pandemic declined over the twelve month period. However, for certain investments in our portfolio, the valuations continue to reflect factors such as specific industry concerns, uncertainty about the duration of business shutdowns and near-term liquidity needs. For additional information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Risk Factors - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the global economy, which has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our portfolio companies and our business and operations.\u201d\nControl Company Investments\nControl investments offer increased risk and reward over straight debt investments. Operating results and changes in market multiples can result in dramatic changes in values from quarter to quarter. Significant downturns in operations can further result in our looking to recoveries on sales of assets rather than the enterprise value of the investment. Equity positions in our portfolio are susceptible to potentially significant changes in value, both increases as well as decreases, due to changes in operating results and market multiples. Our controlled companies discussed below experienced such changes and we recorded corresponding fluctuations in valuations during the year ended June 30, 2021.\nEchelon Transportation, LLC\nProspect owns 100% of the equity of Echelon, a consolidated holding company. Echelon owns 60.7% of the equity of AerLift. Echelon is an aircraft leasing company.\nThe fair value of our investment in Echelon decreased to $84,240 as of June 30, 2021, which is a discount of $13,904 from its amortized cost, compared to a fair value of $85,627 as of June 30, 2020, representing a discount of $2,581 to its amortized cost basis. The increase in discount to amortized cost resulted from lower aircraft residual values, as well as an increase in Echelon's cost basis.\nFirst Tower Finance Company LLC\nProspect owns 100% of the equity of First Tower Delaware, a consolidated holding company. First Tower Delaware owns 80.1% of First Tower Finance. First Tower Finance owns 100% of First Tower, LLC ( First Tower\u201d), a multiline specialty finance company.\nThe fair value of our investment in First Tower increased to $592,356 as of June 30, 2021, representing a premium of $236,502 to its amortized cost basis compared to a fair value of $508,465 as of June 30, 2020, a premium of $150,250 to its amortized cost. The increase in premium to amortized cost was driven by strong financial performance.\nInterDent, Inc.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2018, Prospect exercised its rights and remedies under its loan documents to exercise the shareholder voting rights in respect of the stock of InterDent and to appoint a new Board of Directors of InterDent, all the members of which are our Investment Adviser's professionals. As a result, Prospect's investment in InterDent is classified as a control investment.\nThe fair value of our investment in InterDent increased to $412,339 as of June 30, 2021, a premium of $129,650 to its amortized cost basis compared to a fair value of $230,757 as of June 30, 2020, a discount of $36,296 to its amortized cost. The increase in premium to amortized cost was driven by strong financial performance and expansion of comparable company trading multiples.\nMITY, Inc.\nProspect owns 100% of the equity of MITY Delaware, a consolidated holding company. MITY Delaware previously held 95.58% of the equity of MITY. Effective March 13, 2019, MITY Delaware's equity ownership of MITY increased to 100%. MITY owns 100% of each of MITY-Lite, Inc. ( Mity-Lite\u201d); Broda Enterprises USA, Inc.; and Broda Enterprises ULC ( Broda Canada\u201d).\nThe fair value of our investment in Mity decreased to $49,680 as of June 30, 2021, a discount of $30,834 to its amortized cost basis compared to a fair value of $51,905 as of June 30, 2020, a discount of $20,552 to its amortized cost. The increase in discount to amortized cost resulted from a decline in financial performance, primarily associated with the demand imbalance stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNational Property REIT Corp.\nNPRC is a Maryland corporation and a qualified REIT for federal income tax purposes.

fair value of $878,733 as of June 30, 2020, representing a premium of $267,315.

Nationwide Holdings owns 94.48% of the equity of Nationwide Loan Company LLC ( Nationwide\u201d), with members of Nationwide management owning the remaining 5.52% of the equity.

The increase to the premium was driven by strong financial performance and expansion of comparable company trading multiples.\nR-V Industries, Inc.\nProspect owns 88.27% of the fully-diluted equity of R-V Industries, Inc. ( R-V\u201d), with R-V management owning the remaining 11.73% of the equity. On December 15, 2020 we restructured our $28,622 Senior Subordinated Note with R-V into a $28,622 Senior Secured Note. No realized gain or loss was recorded as a result of the transaction. R-V is a provider of engineering and manufacturing services to chemical, paper, pharmaceutical, and power industries.\nThe fair value of our investment in R-V increased to $49,693 as of June 30, 2021, representing a premium of $14,205 to its amortized cost basis, compared to a fair value of $38,565 as of June 30, 2020, representing a premium of $3,076 to its amortized cost basis. The increase to the premium was driven by strong financial performance and expansion of comparable company trading multiples.\nUSES Corp.\nProspect owns 99.96% of the equity of USES Corp. as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020. USES provides industrial, environmental, and maritime services in the Gulf States region.\nThe fair value of our investment in USES increased to $33,815 as of June 30, 2021, a discount of $34,404 from its amortized cost basis, compared to a fair value of $17,325 as of June 30, 2020, representing a discount of $48,894 to it amortized cost. The decrease in discount to amortized cost resulted from improved financial performance and expansion of comparable company trading multiples.\nValley Electric Company, Inc.\nProspect owns 100% of the common stock of Valley Holdings I, a Consolidated Holding Company.

The increase in premium to amortized cost was driven by an expansion of comparable company trading multiples.\nOur controlled investments, including those discussed above, are valued at $437,286 above their amortized cost as of June 30, 2021.\nAffiliate and Non-Control Company Investments\nWe hold three affiliate investments at June 30, 2021 with a total fair value of $356,734, a premium of $153,791 from their combined amortized cost compared to a fair value of $187,537 as of June 30, 2020, representing a $24,053 premium to its amortized cost. The increase in premium is primarily driven by our investment in PGX Holdings, Inc. ( Progrexion\u201d), which is valued at a premium of $126,933 at June 30, 2021 compared to a premium of $180 as of June 30, 2020. The increase in Progrexion's premium to amortized cost was driven by strong financial performance.\nWith the non-control/non-affiliate investments, generally, there is less volatility related to our total investments because our equity positions tend to be smaller than with our control/affiliate investments, and debt investments are generally not as susceptible to large swings in value as equity investments. For debt investments, the fair value is generally limited on the high side to each loan's par value, plus any prepayment premium that could be imposed. However, as of June 30, 2021, Engine Group, Inc. ( Engine\u201d) and USC, two of our non-control/non-affiliate investments are valued at discounts to amortized cost of $27,258 and $96,794, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, our CLO investment portfolio is valued at a $334,066 discount to amortized cost. Excluding Engine, USC, and the CLO investment portfolio, the fair value of our non-control/non-affiliate investments at June 30, 2021 increased and are valued at $10,695 above their amortized cost, compared to a discount of $35,674 recorded at June 30, 2020. This increase is driven largely by tightening credit spreads as market participants expected a lower yield on similar investments as the level of volatility generated by the COVID-19 pandemic declined over the twelve month period.\nCapitalization\nOur investment activities are capital intensive and the availability and cost of capital is a critical component of our business. We capitalize our business with a combination of debt and equity. Our debt as of June 30, 2021 consists of: a Revolving Credit Facility availing us of the ability to borrow debt subject to borrowing base determinations; Convertible Notes which we issued in April 2017 (with a follow-on issuance in May 2018) and March 2019; Public Notes which we issued in March 2013, October 2018, December 2018 (and from time to time through our 2029 Notes Follow-on Program), January 2021, and May 2021; and Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae which we issue from time to time.

The amounts involved may be material. In addition, we may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue additional debt securities, including secured debt, unsecured debt and/or debt securities convertible into common stock. Any such purchases or exchanges of outstanding debt would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors.\nHistorically, we have funded a portion of our cash needs through borrowings from banks, issuances of senior securities, including secured, unsecured and convertible debt securities, or issuances of common equity. For flexibility, we maintain a universal shelf registration statement that allows for the public offering and sale of our debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, subscription rights, and warrants and units to purchase such securities up to an indeterminate amount. We may from time to time issue securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement or otherwise pursuant to private offerings. The issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors and there can be no assurance that any such issuance will occur or be successful.\nEach of our Convertible Notes, Public Notes and Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae (collectively, our Unsecured Notes\u201d) are our general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured indebtedness and will be senior in right of payment to any of our subordinated indebtedness that may be issued in the future. The Unsecured Notes are effectively subordinated to our existing secured indebtedness, such as our credit facility, and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to any existing and future liabilities and other indebtedness of any of our subsidiaries.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn August 29, 2014, we renegotiated our previous credit facility and closed an expanded five and a half year revolving credit facility (the 2014 Facility\u201d). The lenders had extended commitments of $885,000 under the 2014 Facility as of June 30, 2018. The 2014 Facility included an accordion feature which allowed commitments to be increased up to $1,500,000 in the aggregate. Interest on borrowings under the 2014 Facility was one-month LIBOR plus 225 basis points. Additionally, the lenders charged a fee on the unused portion of the 2014 Facility equal to either 50 basis points if at least 35% of the credit facility was drawn or 100 basis points otherwise.\nOn August 1, 2018, we renegotiated the 2014 Facility and closed an expanded five and a half year revolving credit facility (the 2018 Facility\u201d). The lenders have extended commitments of $1,132,500 as of June 30, 2019. The 2018 Facility included an accordion feature which allowed commitments to be increased up to $1,500,000 in the aggregate.\nOn September 9, 2019, we amended the 2018 Facility and closed an expanded revolving credit facility (the 2019 Facility\u201d).

The 2019 Facility included an accordion feature which allowed commitments to be increased up to $1,500,000 in the aggregate.\nOn April 28, 2021, we amended the 2019 Facility and closed an expanded five year revolving credit facility (the 2021 Facility\u201d and collectively with the 2014 Facility, the 2018 Facility and the 2019 Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The lenders had extended commitments of $1,107,500 as of June 30, 2021. The Revolving Credit Facility includes an accordion feature which allows commitments to be increased up to $1,500,000 in the aggregate. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on April 27, 2026. It includes a revolving period that extends through April 27, 2025, followed by an additional one-year amortization period, with distributions allowed to Prospect after the completion of the revolving period. During such one-year amortization period, all principal payments on the pledged assets will be applied to reduce the balance. At the end of the one-year amortization period, the remaining balance will become due, if required by the lenders.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains restrictions pertaining to the geographic and industry concentrations of funded loans, maximum size of funded loans, interest rate payment frequency of funded loans, maturity dates of funded loans and minimum equity requirements. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain requirements relating to portfolio performance, including required minimum portfolio yield and limitations on delinquencies and charge-offs, violation of which could result in the early termination of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility also requires the maintenance of a minimum liquidity requirement. As of June 30, 2021, we were in compliance with the applicable covenants.\nInterest on borrowings under the 2021 Facility is one-month LIBOR plus 205 basis points. Additionally, the lenders charge a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility equal to either 40 basis points if more than 60% of the credit facility is drawn, or 70 basis points if more than 35% and an amount less than or equal to 60% of the credit facility is drawn, or 150 basis points if an amount less than or equal to 35% of the credit facility is drawn. The 2021 Facility requires us to pledge assets as collateral in order to borrow under the credit facility.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2021, June 30, 2020, and June 30, 2019, the average stated interest rate (i.e., rate in effect plus the spread) and average outstanding borrowings for the Revolving Credit Facility were as follows:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended June 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average stated interest rate </td> <td>2.31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.55 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average outstanding balance </td> <td>$386,848 </td> <td> </td> <td>$222,758 </td> <td> </td> <td>$225,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, we had $640,853 and $545,496, respectively, available to us for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of $356,937 and $237,536 outstanding borrowings as of the respective balance sheet dates. As of June 30, 2021, the investments, including cash and cash equivalents, used as collateral for the Revolving Credit Facility had an aggregate fair value of $1,807,442, which represents 28.8% of our total investments, including cash and cash equivalents. These assets are held and owned by PCF, a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, and, as such, these investments are not available to our general creditors. As additional eligible investments are transferred to PCF and pledged under the Revolving Credit Facility, PCF will generate additional availability up to the current commitment amount of $1,107,500. The release of any assets from PCF requires the approval of the facility agent.\nIn connection with the origination and amendments of the Revolving Credit Facility, we incurred $15,299 of fees and $7,509 were carried over from the previous facilities, all of which are being amortized over the term of the facility in accordance with ASC 470-50. As of June 30, 2021, $11,141 remains to be amortized and is reflected as deferred financing costs on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nDuring the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded $18,208, $21,850 and $23,097, respectively, of interest costs, unused fees and amortization of financing costs on the Revolving Credit Facility as interest expense.\nConvertible Notes\nOn April 11, 2014, we issued $400,000 aggregate principal amount of convertible notes that mature on April 15, 2020 (the 2020 Notes\u201d), unless previously converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms.

After reducing our net asset value by the stated value of our cumulative preferred stock issuances, our net asset value available to common stockholders increased by $752,616, or $1.63 per common share. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net realized and net change in unrealized gains of $678,070, or $1.77 per basic weighted average common share. During the year ended June 30, 2021, net investment income of $285,737, or $0.75 per basic weighted average common share, also exceeded distributions to common and preferred stockholders of $277,856 (including distributions classified as return of capital distributions to common stockholders), or $0.72 per basic weighted average common share, resulting in a net increase of $0.03 per basic weighted average common share. The increase was primarily offset by $0.11 of dilution per common share related to common stock issuances through our common stock dividend reinvestment program and by $0.04 of dilution per common share related to preferred stock issuances for the year ended June 30, 2021.

These companies typically do not issue securities rated investment grade, and have limited resources, limited operating history, and concentrated product lines or customers. These are generally private companies with limited operating information available and are likely to depend on a small core of management talents. Changes in any of these factors can have a significant impact on the value of the portfolio company. These changes, along with those discussed in Investment Valuation above, can cause significant fluctuations in our net change in unrealized gains (losses) from investments, and therefore our net increase (decrease) in nets assets resulting from operations attributable to common stockholders, quarter over quarter.\nInvestment Income\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities that we own, dividend income on any common or preferred stock that we own, and fees generated from the structuring of new deals. Our investments, if in the form of debt securities, will typically have a term of one to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. To the extent achievable, we will seek to collateralize our investments by obtaining security interests in our portfolio companies' assets. We also may acquire minority or majority equity interests in our portfolio companies, which may pay cash or in-kind dividends on a recurring or otherwise negotiated basis. In addition, we may generate revenue in other forms including prepayment penalties and possibly consulting fees. Any such fees generated in connection with our investments are recognized as earned.\nInvestment income consists of interest income, including accretion of loan origination fees and prepayment penalty fees, dividend income and other income, including settlement of net profits interests, overriding royalty interests and structuring fees.\nThe following table describes the various components of investment income and the related levels of debt investments:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended June 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>554,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>554,376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend income </td> <td>5,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income </td> <td>72,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>631,967 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>623,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt principal of performing interest bearing investments(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,460,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,254,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate earned on performing interest bearing investments(1)\n</td> <td>10.15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.55 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt principal of all interest bearing investments(2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,799,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,879,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate earned on all interest bearing investments(2)\n</td> <td>9.56 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.43 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Excludes equity investments and non-accrual loans.\n(2) Excludes equity investments.\nThe average interest earned on interest bearing performing assets decreased from 10.55% for the year ended June 30, 2020 to 10.15% for the year ended June 30, 2021. The decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in interest income due to a decline in LIBOR, as well as originations at lower rates than our average existing portfolio yield, offset by early repayments causing an increase in accelerated income. The average interest earned on all interest bearing assets increased from 9.43% for the year ended June 30, 2020 to 9.56% for the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase is primarily due to decreases in non-accrual loans.\nInvestment income is also generated from dividends and other income which is less predictable than interest income.

These expenses include our allocable portion of overhead under the Administration Agreement with Prospect Administration under which Prospect Administration provides administrative services and facilities for us. Our investment advisory fees compensate the Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions.\nThe following table describes the various components of our operating expenses:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years ended June 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base management fee </td> <td>$ </td> <td>114,622 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income incentive fee </td> <td>71,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,057 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and credit facility expenses </td> <td>130,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allocation of overhead from Prospect Administration </td> <td>14,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Audit, compliance and tax related fees </td> <td>3,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Directors' fees </td> <td>450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other general and administrative expenses </td> <td>11,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,773 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Operating Expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>346,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>357,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal gross and net base management fee was $114,622 and $108,910 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in total gross base management fee is directly related to an increase in average total assets.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we incurred $71,227 and $68,057 of income incentive fees, respectively. This increase was driven by a corresponding increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income, to $356,964 from $333,751 for the years ended June 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively. No capital gains incentive fee has yet been incurred pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. Income incentive fee for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 includes a $264 and $1,306 adjustment for fees earned in prior periods that were neither expensed nor paid to the Investment Adviser.\nDuring the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we incurred $130,618 and $148,368, respectively, of interest and credit facility expenses related to our Revolving Credit Facility, Convertible Notes, Public Notes and Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae (collectively, our Notes\u201d). These expenses are related directly to the leveraging capacity put into place for each of those periods and the levels of indebtedness actually undertaken in those periods.\nThe table below describes the various expenses of our Notes and the related indicators of leveraging capacity and indebtedness during these years.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended June 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on borrowings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,501 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred financing costs </td> <td>7,251 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accretion of discount on unsecured debt </td> <td>1,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility commitment fees </td> <td>6,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest and credit facility expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average principal debt outstanding </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,336,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,314,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized weighted average stated interest rate on borrowings(1)\n</td> <td>4.94 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.47 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized weighted average interest rate on borrowings(2)\n</td> <td>5.59 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes only the stated interest expense.\n(2)Includes the stated interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, accretion of discount on Public Notes and commitment fees on the undrawn portion of our Revolving Credit Facility.\nInterest expense decreased from $148,368 year ended June 30, 2020 to $130,618 for the year ended June 30, 2021. The weighted average stated interest rate on borrowings (excluding amortization, accretion and undrawn facility fees) decreased from 5.47% for the year ended June 30, 2020 to 4.94% for the year ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to repurchases and early retirements of our Convertible Notes and the issuance of the 2026 Notes and 3.364% 2026 Notes at lower rates.\nThe allocation of net overhead expense from Prospect Administration was $14,262 and $18,247 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Prospect Administration received estimated payments of $1,572 and $1,530 directly from our portfolio companies and certain funds managed by the Investment Adviser for legal services during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, we were given a credit in the amount of $3,522 for legal expenses incurred on behalf of our portfolio companies that were remitted to Prospect Administration during the year ended June 30, 2021. We were given a credit for these payments as a reduction of the administrative services cost payable by us to Prospect Administration. Had Prospect Administration not received these payments, Prospect Administration's charges for its administrative services would have increased by this amount.\nTotal operating expenses, excluding investment advisory fees, interest and credit facility expenses, and allocation of overhead from Prospect Administration ( Other Operating Expenses\u201d), net of any expense reimbursements, were $15,501 and $14,254 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of $1,247 during the year ended June 30, 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses offset by a decrease in legal fees due to a reimbursement from litigation proceeds of previously expensed legal fees.\nNet Realized Gains (Losses)\nThe following table details net realized gains (losses) from investments for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020:\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended June 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portfolio Company </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Edmentum Ultimate Holdings, LLC </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spartan Energy Services, LLC - Term Loan B </td> <td>2,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCPI, Inc. </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,366 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rated Secured Structured Note Portfolio </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,885 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New Century Transportation, Inc. </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>449 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Voya CLO 2012-2, Ltd. </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(450) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PeopleConnect Holdings, LLC </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(522) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Madison Park Funding XI, Ltd. </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,949) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Easy Gardener </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,719) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net </td> <td>236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>366 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains (losses) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,574) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Realized Losses from Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, we recorded a net realized loss from the extinguishment of debt of $23,511 and $2,702, respectively.

Furthermore, in the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board ( ARRC\u201d) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. On August 24, 2017, the Federal Reserve Board requested public comment on a proposal by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in cooperation with the Office of Financial Research, to produce three new reference rates intended to serve as alternatives to LIBOR. These alternative rates are based on overnight repurchase agreement transactions secured by U.S. Treasury Securities. On December 12, 2017, following consideration of public comments, the Federal Reserve Board concluded that the public would benefit if the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published the three proposed reference rates as alternatives to LIBOR (the Federal Reserve Board Notice\u201d). In April 2018, the Federal Reserve System, in conjunction with the ARRC, announced the replacement of LIBOR with a new index, calculated by short term repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ( SOFR\u201d). On June 12, 2019, the Staff from the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance, Division of Investment Management, Division of Trading and Markets, and Office of the Chief Accountant issued a statement about the potentially significant effects on financial markets and market participants when LIBOR is discontinued in 2021 and no longer available as a reference benchmark rate. The Staff encouraged all market participants to identify contracts that reference LIBOR and begin transitions to alternative rates. Although SOFR appears to be the preferred replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR, at this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United States, United Kingdom or elsewhere or, whether the COVID-19 will have further effect on LIBOR transition plans. The elimination of LIBOR or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations.\nAt this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of the FCA Announcement or other regulatory changes or announcements, any establishment of any alternative reference rates, including SOFR and its market acceptance, or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our net investment income cannot yet be determined. The CLOs in which the Company is invested generally contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by requiring the CLO administrator to calculate a replacement rate primarily through dealer polling on the applicable measurement date. However, there is uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of the dealer polling processes, including the willingness of banks to provide such quotations, which could adversely impact our net investment income. Recently, the CLOs we are invested in have included, or have been amended to include, language permitting the CLO investment manager to implement a market replacement rate (like SOFR) upon the occurrence of certain material disruption events. However, we cannot ensure that all CLOs in which we are invested will have such provisions, nor can we ensure the CLO investment managers will undertake the suggested amendments when able. In addition, the effect of a phase out of LIBOR on U.S. senior secured loans, the underlying assets of the CLOs in which we invest, is currently unclear. To the extent that any replacement rate utilized for senior secured loans differs from that utilized for a CLO that holds those loans, the CLO would experience an interest rate mismatch between its assets and liabilities which could have an adverse impact on the Company's net investment income and portfolio returns.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, our operating activities provided $31,019 and $429,438 of cash, respectively. There were no investing activities for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Financing activities used $11,970 and $491,975 of cash during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which included dividend payments of $195,574 and $239,954, respectively.\nOur primary uses of funds have been to continue to invest in portfolio companies, through both debt and equity investments, repay outstanding borrowings and to make cash distributions to our stockholders.\nOur primary sources of funds have historically been issuances of debt and equity. More recently, we have and may continue to fund a portion of our cash needs through repayments and opportunistic sales of our existing investment portfolio. We may also securitize a portion of our investments in unsecured or senior secured loans or other assets. Our objective is to put in place such borrowings in order to enable us to expand our portfolio. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we borrowed $1,092,861 and we made repayments totaling $973,460 under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2021, our outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility was $356,937. As of June 30, 2021, we had, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, $263,100 outstanding on the Convertible Notes, $1,114,717 outstanding on the Public Notes, and $498,215 outstanding on the Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae (See Capitalization\u201d above).\nUndrawn committed revolvers and delayed draw term loans to our portfolio companies incur commitment and unused fees ranging from 0.00% to 5.00%. As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, we had $67,385 and $41,487, respectively, of undrawn revolver and delayed draw term loan commitments to our portfolio companies. The fair value of our undrawn committed revolvers and delayed draw term loans was zero as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020.\nWe have guaranteed $2,737 in standby letters of credit issued through a financial intermediary and $2,775 of equipment lease obligations on behalf of InterDent, Inc. ( InterDent\u201d) as of June 30, 2021. Under these arrangements, we would be required to make payments to the financial intermediary or equipment lease provider, respectively, if InterDent was to default on their related payment obligations. As of June 30, 2021, we have not recorded a liability on the statement of assets and liabilities for these guarantees as the likelihood of default on the standby letters of credit or equipment lease is deemed to be remote.\nOn February 13, 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-236415) that was effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act as permitted under the Small Business Credit Availability Act. The registration statement permits us to issue, through one or more transactions, an indeterminate amount of securities, consisting of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, subscription rights to purchase our securities, warrants representing rights to purchase our securities or separately tradeable units combining two or more of our securities.\nPreferred Stock\nOn August 3, 2020, we entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement with Preferred Capital Securities, LLC ( PCS\u201d), pursuant to which PCS has agreed to serve as the Company's agent, principal distributor and dealer manager for the Company's offering of up to 40,000,000 shares, par value $0.001 per share, of preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. Such preferred stock will initially be issued in multiple series, including the Series A1 Preferred Stock, the Series M1 Preferred Stock, and the Series M2 Preferred Stock. In connection with such offering, on August 3, 2020, we filed Articles Supplementary with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, reclassifying and designating 120,000,000 shares of the Company's authorized and unissued shares of common stock into shares of preferred stock as Convertible Preferred Stock.\u201d On October 30, 2020, we entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement with InspereX LLC, pursuant to which InspereX LLC has agreed to serve as the Company's agent and dealer manager for the Company's offering of up to 10,000,000 shares, par value $0.001 per share, of 5.50% Series AA1 Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. In connection with such offering, on October 30, 2020, we filed Articles Supplementary with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, reclassifying and designating an additional 20,000,000 shares of the Company's authorized and unissued shares of common stock into shares of preferred stock as Convertible Preferred Stock. On May 19, 2021, we entered into an Underwriting Agreement with UBS Securities LLC, relating to the offer and sale of 187,000 shares, par value $0.001 per share, of 5.50% Series A2 Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. The issuance of the Series A2 Preferred Stock settled on May 26, 2021. In connection with such offering, on May 19, 2021, we filed Articles Supplementary with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, reclassifying and designating an additional 1,000,000 shares of the Company's authorized and unissued shares of common stock into shares of preferred stock as Convertible Preferred Stock.\nIn connection with the offerings of the 5.50% Preferred Stock, we adopted and amended, respectively, a preferred stock dividend reinvestment plan (the Preferred Stock Plan\u201d or the Preferred Stock DRIP\u201d), pursuant to which holders of the 5.50% Preferred Stock will have dividends on their 5.50% Preferred Stock automatically reinvested in additional shares of such 5.50% Preferred Stock at a price per share of $25.00, if they elect.\nEach series of 5.50% Preferred Stock ranks (with respect to the payment of dividends and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) (a) senior to our common stock, (b) on parity with each other series of our preferred stock, and (c) junior to our existing and future secured and unsecured indebtedness. See Note 8, Fair Value and Maturity of Debt Outstanding for further discussion on our senior securities.\nAt any time prior to the listing of the 5.50% Preferred Stock on a national securities exchange, shares of the 5.50% Preferred Stock are convertible, at the option of the holder of the 5.50% Preferred Stock (the Holder Optional Conversion\u201d). We will settle any Holder Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the Settlement Amount (as defined below) that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average price of shares of our common stock over each of the five consecutive trading days ending on the Holder Conversion Exercise Date (as defined in the applicable prospectus supplement)(such arithmetic average, the 5-day VWAP\u201d). For the Series A1 Preferred Stock, the Series AA1 Preferred Stock, and the Series A2 Preferred Stock, Settlement Amount\u201d means (A) $25.00 per share (the Stated Value\u201d), plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the Holder Conversion Exercise Date, minus (C) the Holder Optional Conversion Fee (as described in the prospectus supplements relating to the Series A1 Preferred Stock, the Series AA1 Preferred Stock, or the Series A2 Preferred\nStock, as applicable) applicable on the respective Holder Conversion Deadline (as defined in the applicable prospectus supplement). For the Series M Preferred Stock, Settlement Amount\u201d means (A) the Stated Value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the Holder Conversion Exercise Date, minus (C) the applicable Series M Clawback, if any (as described in the prospectus supplements relating to the Series M Preferred Stock. Series M Clawback,\u201d if applicable, means an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all dividends, whether paid or accrued, on such share of Series M Stock in the three full months prior to the Holder Conversion Exercise Date. Subject to certain limited exceptions, we will not pay any portion of the Settlement Amount in cash (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock) until the five year anniversary of the date on which a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock has been issued. Beginning on the five year anniversary of the date on which a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock is issued, we may elect to settle all or a portion of any Holder Optional Conversion in cash without limitation or restriction. The right of holders to convert a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock will terminate upon the listing of such share on a national securities exchange.\nSubject to certain limited exceptions allowing earlier redemption, beginning on the earlier of the five year anniversary of the date on which a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock has been issued, or, for listed shares of 5.50% Preferred Stock, five years from the earliest date on which any series that has been listed was first issued (the earlier of such dates, the Redemption Eligibility Date\u201d), such share of 5.50% Preferred Stock may be redeemed at any time or from time to time at our option (the Issuer Optional Redemption\u201d), at a redemption price of 100% of the Stated Value of the shares of 5.50% Preferred Stock to be redeemed plus unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption.\nSubject to certain limitations, each share of 5.50% Preferred Stock may be converted at our option (the Issuer Optional Conversion\u201d). We will settle any Issuer Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount (as defined below) that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the IOC Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the 5-day VWAP, subject to our ability to obtain or maintain any stockholder approval that may be required under the 1940 Act to permit us to sell our common stock below net asset value if the 5-day VWAP represents a discount to our net asset value per share of common stock. For the 5.50% Preferred Stock, IOC Settlement Amount\u201d means (A) the Stated Value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the date fixed for conversion. Subject to certain limited exceptions, we will not exercise an Issuer Optional Conversion with respect to a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock until after the date set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement with respect to the 5.50% Preferred Stock. In connection with an Issuer Optional Conversion, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or maintain any stockholder approval that may be required under the 1940 Act to permit us to sell our common stock below net asset value. If we do not have or obtain any required stockholder approval under the 1940 Act to sell our common stock below net asset value and the 5-day VWAP is at a discount to our net asset value per share of common stock, we will settle any conversions in connection with an Issuer Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the IOC Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the NAV per share of common stock at the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the date of conversion. We will not pay any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount from an Issuer Optional Conversion in cash (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock) until the Redemption Eligibility Date. Beginning on the Redemption Eligibility Date, we may elect to settle any Issuer Optional Conversion in cash without limitation or restriction. In the event that we exercise an Issuer Optional Conversion with respect to any shares of 5.50% Preferred Stock, the holder of such 5.50% Preferred Stock may instead elect a Holder Optional Conversion with respect to such 5.50% Preferred Stock provided that the date of conversion for such Holder Optional Conversion would occur prior to the date of conversion for an Issuer Optional Conversion.\nWe determined the estimated value as of June 30, 2021 of our 5.50% Preferred Stock, with a $25.00 stated value per share. We engaged a third-party valuation service to assist in our determination based on the calculation resulting from the total equity on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 (the Form 10-K\u201d), which was prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, adjusted for the fair value of our investments (i.e. from our Consolidated Schedule of Investments) and total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of our 5.50% Preferred Stock outstanding. Based on this methodology and because the result from the calculation above is greater than the $25.00 per share stated value of our Preferred Stock, the estimated value of our Preferred Stock as of June 30, 2021 is $25.00 per share.\nCommon Stock\nOur common stockholders' equity accounts as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 reflect cumulative shares issued, net of shares repurchased, as of those respective dates. Our common stock has been issued through public offerings, a registered direct offering, the exercise of over-allotment options on the part of the underwriters, our dividend reinvestment plan and in connection with the acquisition of certain controlled portfolio companies. When our common stock is issued, the related\noffering expenses have been charged against paid-in capital in excess of par. All underwriting fees and offering expenses were borne by us.\nWe did not repurchase any shares of our common stock for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of June 30, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet liabilities or other contractual obligations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, other than those which originate from 1) the investment advisory and management agreement and the administration agreement and 2) the portfolio companies.\nRecent Developments\nOn July 12, 2021, we entered into an underwriting agreement by and among us, Prospect Capital Management L.P., Prospect Administration LLC, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets, LLC and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the underwriters, relating to the offer and sale of 6,000,000 shares, or $150,000 in aggregate liquidation preference, of our 5.35% Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the 5.35% Preferred Stock\u201d), at a public offering price of $25.00 per share. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 shares of 5.35% Preferred Stock solely to cover over-allotments. The offering closed on July 19, 2021.\nOn July 21, 2021, we funded total commitments of $202,931, comprised of a $49,000 first lien senior secured floating rate term loan and a $153,931 second lien senior secured floating rate term loan, to support the refinancing of PGX Holdings, Inc., a portfolio company of H.I.G. Capital, LLC and market leading provider of consumer credit repair services in the U.S. In connection with the refinancing, our $47,773 first lien senior secured term loan, $18,164 1.5 lien senior secured term loan and $122,271 second lien senior secured term loan outstanding with PGX Holdings, Inc. were fully repaid at par.\nDuring the period of July 14, 2021 through August 13, 2021, we provided notice to call certain of our Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae at par with the following terms:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notice Date </td> <td>Settlement Date </td> <td>Maturity Date Range </td> <td>Interest Rate Range </td> <td>Principal </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7/14/2021 </td> <td>7/21/2021 </td> <td>1/15/2026 - 5/15/2029 </td> <td>4.000% - 6.250% </td> <td>$68,422 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7/15/2021 </td> <td>8/15/2021 </td> <td>2/15/2024 </td> <td>5.750% - 6.000% </td> <td>$4,880 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>8/4/2021 </td> <td>8/11/2021 </td> <td>12/15/2027 - 12/15/2030 </td> <td>4.500% - 6.000% </td> <td>$54,831 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>8/13/2021 </td> <td>9/15/2021 </td> <td>3/15/2024 </td> <td>5.750% </td> <td>$2,581 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn August 19, 2021, we increased total commitments to our Revolving Credit Facility by $50,000 to $1,157,500 in the aggregate.\nDuring the period from July 1, 2021 through August 24, 2021, we issued $61,137 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae for net proceeds of $59,648, with $9,170 of such aggregate principal amount scheduled to settle on August 26, 2021.\nOn August 24, 2021, we announced the declaration of monthly dividends for our 5.50% Preferred Stock for holders of record on the following dates based on an annual rate equal to 5.50% of the Stated Value of $25.00 per share as set forth in the Articles Supplementary for the 5.50% Preferred Stock, from the date of issuance or, if later from the most recent dividend payment date, as follows:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Monthly Cash 5.50% Preferred Shareholder Distribution </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td>Payment Date </td> <td>Monthly Amount ($ per share), before pro ration for partial periods </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 2021 </td> <td>9/15/2021 </td> <td>10/1/2021 </td> <td>$0.114583 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 2021 </td> <td>10/20/2021 </td> <td>11/1/2021 </td> <td>$0.114583 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 2021 </td> <td>11/17/2021 </td> <td>12/1/2021 </td> <td>$0.114583 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn August 24, 2021, we announced the declaration of quarterly dividends for our 5.35% Preferred Stock for holders of record on the following dates based on an annual rate equal to 5.35% of the Stated Value of $25.00 per share as set forth in the Articles Supplementary for the 5.35% Preferred Stock, from the date of issuance or, if later from the most recent dividend payment date, as follows:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarterly Cash 5.35% Preferred Shareholder Distribution </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td>Payment Date </td> <td>Amount ($ per share) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>July - October 2021 </td> <td>10/20/2021 </td> <td>11/1/2021 </td> <td>$0.382674 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn August 24, 2021, we announced the declaration of monthly dividends on our common stock as follows:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Monthly Cash Common Shareholder Distribution </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td>Payment Date </td> <td>Amount ($ per share) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 2021 </td> <td>9/28/2021 </td> <td>10/21/2021 </td> <td>$0.06 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 2021 </td> <td>10/27/2021 </td> <td>11/18/2021 </td> <td>$0.06 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K, ASC 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies ( ASC 946\u201d), and Articles 3, 6 and 12 of Regulation S-X. Under the 1940 Act, ASC 946, and the regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company or an operating company which provides substantially all of its services to benefit us. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Prospect, PCF, PSBL, PYC, and the Consolidated Holding Companies. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial results of our non-substantially wholly-owned holding companies and operating portfolio company investments are not consolidated in the financial statements. Any operating companies owned by the Consolidated Holding Companies are not consolidated.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made in the presentation of prior consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to conform to the presentation as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income, expenses, and gains and losses during the reported period. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, creditworthiness of the issuers of our investment portfolio and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ, and these differences could be material.\nInvestment Classification\nWe are a non-diversified company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. As required by the 1940 Act, we classify our investments by level of control. As defined in the 1940 Act, Control Investments\u201d are those where there is the ability or power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company. Control is generally deemed to exist when a company or individual possesses or has the right to acquire within 60 days or less, a beneficial ownership of more than 25% of the voting securities of an investee company. Under the 1940 Act, Affiliate Investments\u201d are defined by a lesser degree of influence and are deemed to exist through the possession outright or via the right to acquire within 60 days or less, beneficial ownership of 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of another person. Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments\u201d are those that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.\nAs a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets\u201d specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, our qualifying assets as a percentage of total assets, stood at 76.31% and 74.44%, respectively.\nInvestment Transactions\nInvestments are recognized when we assume an obligation to acquire a financial instrument and assume the risks for gains or losses related to that instrument. Specifically, we record all security transactions on a trade date basis. Investments are derecognized when we assume an obligation to sell a financial instrument and forego the risks for gains or losses related to that instrument. Amounts for investments traded but not yet settled are reported in Due to Broker or Due from Broker, in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nForeign Currency\nForeign currency amounts are translated into US Dollars (USD) on the following basis:\ni.fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities-at the spot exchange rate on the last business day of the period; and\nii.purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses-at the rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such investment transactions, income or expenses.\nWe do not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair values of investments held or disposed of during the period. Such fluctuations are included within the net realized and net change in unrealized gains or losses from investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInvestment Risks\nOur investments are subject to a variety of risks. Those risks include the following:\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the fair value of the financial instrument.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk represents the risk that we would incur if the counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their agreements with us.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk represents the possibility that we may not be able to rapidly adjust the size of our investment positions in times of high volatility and financial stress at a reasonable price.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk represents a change in interest rates, which could result in an adverse change in the fair value of an interest-bearing financial instrument.\nPrepayment Risk\nMany of our debt investments allow for prepayment of principal without penalty. Downward changes in interest rates may cause prepayments to occur at a faster than expected rate, thereby effectively shortening the maturity of the security and making us less likely to fully earn all of the expected income of that security and reinvesting in a lower yielding instrument.\nStructured Credit Related Risk\nCLO investments may be riskier and less transparent to us than direct investments in underlying companies. CLOs typically will have no significant assets other than their underlying senior secured loans. Therefore, payments on CLO investments are and will be payable solely from the cash flows from such senior secured loans.\nOnline Small-and-Medium-Sized Business Lending Risk\nWith respect to our online small-and-medium-sized business ( SME\u201d) lending initiative, we invest primarily in marketplace loans through marketplace lending platforms (e.g. OnDeck). We do not conduct loan origination activities\nourselves. Therefore, our ability to purchase SME loans, and our ability to grow our portfolio of SME loans, is directly influenced by the business performance and competitiveness of the marketplace loan origination business of the marketplace lending platforms from which we purchase SME loans. In addition, our ability to analyze the risk-return profile of SME loans is significantly dependent on the marketplace platforms' ability to effectively evaluate a borrower's credit profile and likelihood of default. If we are unable to effectively evaluate borrowers' credit profiles or the credit decisioning and scoring models implemented by each platform, we may incur unanticipated losses which could adversely impact our operating results.\nForeign Currency\nInvestments denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency transactions may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with those of domestic origin. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities.\nInvestment Valuation\nAs a BDC, and in accordance with the 1940 Act, we fair value our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis, with any unrealized gains and losses reflected in net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. To value our investments, we follow the guidance of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ( ASC 820\u201d), that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in conformity with GAAP, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. In accordance with ASC 820, the fair value of our investments is defined as the price that we would receive upon selling an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market in which that investment is transacted.\nASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nIn all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment.\nOur Board of Directors has established procedures for the valuation of our investment portfolio. These procedures are detailed below.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations.\nFor most of our investments, market quotations are not available. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, our Board of Directors has approved a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below.\n1.Each portfolio company or investment is reviewed by our investment professionals with independent valuation firms engaged by our Board of Directors.\n2.The independent valuation firms prepare independent valuations for each investment based on their own independent assessments and issue their report.\n3.The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and discusses with the independent valuation firms the valuation reports, and then makes a recommendation to the Board of Directors of the value for each investment.\n4.The Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser, the respective independent valuation firm and the Audit Committee.\nOur non-CLO investments are valued utilizing a yield technique, enterprise value ( EV\u201d) technique, net asset value technique, asset recovery technique, discounted cash flow technique, or a combination of techniques, as appropriate. The yield technique uses loan spreads for loans and other relevant information implied by market data involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Under the EV technique, the EV of a portfolio company is first determined and allocated over the portfolio company's securities in order of their preference relative to one another (i.e., waterfall\u201d allocation). To determine the EV, we typically use a market (multiples) valuation approach that considers relevant and applicable market trading data of guideline public companies, transaction metrics from precedent merger and acquisitions transactions, and/or a discounted cash flow technique. The net asset value technique, an income approach, is used to derive a value of an underlying investment (such as real estate property) by dividing a relevant earnings stream by an appropriate capitalization rate. For this purpose, we consider capitalization rates for similar properties as may be obtained from guideline public companies and/or relevant transactions. The asset recovery technique is intended to approximate the net recovery value of an investment based on, among other things, assumptions regarding liquidation proceeds based on a hypothetical liquidation of a portfolio company's assets. The discounted cash flow technique converts future cash flows or earnings to a range of fair values from which a single estimate may be derived utilizing an appropriate discount rate. The fair value measurement is based on the net present value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts.\nIn applying these methodologies, additional factors that we consider in valuing our investments may include, as we deem relevant: security covenants, call protection provisions, and information rights; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company's ability to make payments; the principal markets in which the portfolio company does business; publicly available financial ratios of peer companies; the principal market; and enterprise values, among other factors.\nOur investments in CLOs are classified as Level 3 fair value measured securities under ASC 820 and are valued using a discounted multi-path cash flow model. The CLO structures are analyzed to identify the risk exposures and to determine an appropriate call date (i.e., expected maturity). These risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations, which is a simulation used to model the probability of different outcomes, to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows from the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market as well as certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment. In addition, we generate a single-path cash flow utilizing our best estimate of expected cash receipts, and assess the reasonableness of the implied discount rate that would be effective for the value derived from the multi-path cash flows. We are not responsible for and have no influence over the asset management of the portfolios underlying the CLO investments we hold, as those portfolios are managed by non-affiliated third-party CLO collateral managers. The main risk factors are default risk, prepayment risk, interest rate risk, downgrade risk, and credit spread risk.\nValuation of Other Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nASC 825, Financial Instruments, specifically ASC 825-10-25, permits an entity to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value (the Fair Value Option\u201d). We have not elected the Fair Value Option to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities. See Note 8 in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for the disclosure of the fair value of our outstanding debt and the market observable inputs used in determining fair value.\nConvertible Notes\nWe have recorded the Convertible Notes at their contractual amounts. We have determined that the embedded conversion options in the Convertible Unsecured Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. See Note 5 in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nRevenue Recognition\nRealized gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated using the specific identification method.\nInterest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis. Original issue discounts and market discounts are capitalized and accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans using the effective interest method or straight-line, as applicable, and adjusted only for material amendments or prepayments. Upon a prepayment of a loan, prepayment premiums, original issue discount, or market discounts are recorded as interest income.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Unpaid accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans are either applied to the cost basis or interest income, depending upon management's judgment of the collectibility of the loan receivable. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and in\nmanagement's judgment, is likely to remain current and future principal and interest collections when due are probable. Interest received and applied against cost while a loan is on non-accrual, and PIK interest capitalized but not recognized while on non-accrual, is recognized prospectively on the effective yield basis through maturity of the loan when placed back on accrual status, to the extent deemed collectible by management. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 0.6% of our total assets at fair value are in non-accrual status.\nSome of our loans and other investments may have contractual payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest or dividends. PIK income computed at the contractual rate is accrued into income and reflected as receivable up to the capitalization date. PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities. When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued. On these payment dates, we capitalize the accrued interest (reflecting such amounts in the basis as additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. At the point that we believe PIK is not fully expected to be realized, the PIK investment will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are reversed from the related receivable through interest or dividend income, respectively. We do not reverse previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends. Upon capitalization, PIK is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments. PIK investments on non-accrual status are restored to accrual status if we believe that PIK is expected to be realized.\nInterest income from investments in Subordinated Structured Notes (typically preferred shares, income notes or subordinated notes of CLO funds) and equity\u201d class of security of securitized trust is recorded based upon an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed cash flows in accordance with ASC 325-40, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. We monitor the expected cash inflows from our CLO and securitized trust equity investments, including the expected residual payments, and the effective yield is determined and updated periodically.\nDividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.\nOther income generally includes amendment fees, commitment fees, administrative agent fees and structuring fees which are recorded when earned. Excess deal deposits, net profits interests and overriding royalty interests are included in other income. See Note 10 in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nFederal and State Income Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC and intend to continue to comply with the requirements of the Code applicable to RICs. We are required to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and intend to distribute (or retain through a deemed distribution) all of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain to stockholders; therefore, we have made no provision for income taxes. The character of income and gains that we will distribute is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP. Book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified to paid-in capital.\nIf we do not distribute (or are not deemed to have distributed) at least 98% of our annual ordinary income and 98.2% of our capital gains in the calendar year earned, we will generally be required to pay an excise tax equal to 4% of the amount by which 98% of our annual ordinary income and 98.2% of our capital gains exceed the distributions from such taxable income for the year. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income, we accrue excise taxes, if any, on estimated excess taxable income. As of June 30, 2021, we do not expect to have any excise tax due for the 2021 calendar year. Thus, we have not accrued any excise tax for this period.\nIf we fail to satisfy the annual distribution requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would we be required to make distributions. Distributions would generally be taxable to our individual and other non-corporate taxable stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the reduced maximum rate applicable to qualified dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, provided certain holding period and other requirements are met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributions would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. To qualify again to be taxed as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to distribute to our stockholders our accumulated earnings and profits attributable to non-RIC years. In addition, if we failed to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, then, in order to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to elect to recognize and pay tax on any net built-in gain (the excess of aggregate gain, including items of income, over aggregate loss that would have been realized if we had been liquidated) or, alternatively, be subject to taxation on such built-in gain recognized for a period of five years.\nWe follow ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. As of June 30, 2021, we did not record any unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities. Management's determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an on-going analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. Although we file both federal and state income tax returns, our major tax jurisdiction is federal. Our federal tax returns for the tax years ended August 31, 2018 and thereafter remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.\nDividends and Distributions\nDividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount, if any, to be paid as a monthly dividend or distribution is approved by our Board of Directors quarterly and is generally based upon our management's estimate of our future taxable earnings. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually.\nOur distributions may exceed our earnings, and therefore, portions of the distributions that we make may be a return of the money originally invested and represent a return of capital distribution to shareholders for tax purposes.\nFinancing Costs\nWe record origination expenses related to our Revolving Credit Facility and the Unsecured Notes as deferred financing costs. These expenses are deferred and amortized as part of interest expense using the straight-line method over the stated life of the obligation for our Revolving Credit Facility and for our Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae. The effective interest method is used to amortize deferred financing costs for our remaining Unsecured Notes over the respective expected life or maturity. In the event that we modify or extinguish our debt before maturity, we follow the guidance in ASC 470-50, Modification and Extinguishments ( ASC 470-50\u201d). For modifications to or exchanges of our Revolving Credit Facility, any unamortized deferred costs relating to lenders who are not part of the new lending group are expensed. For extinguishments of our Unsecured Notes, any unamortized deferred costs are deducted from the carrying amount of the debt in determining the gain or loss from the extinguishment.\nUnamortized deferred financing costs are presented as a direct deduction to the respective Unsecured Notes (see Notes 5, 6, and 7 in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).\nWe may record registration expenses related to shelf filings as prepaid expenses. These expenses consist principally of SEC registration fees, legal fees and accounting fees incurred. These prepaid expenses are charged to capital upon the receipt of proceeds from an equity offering or charged to expense if no offering is completed. As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, there are no prepaid expenses related to registration expenses and all amounts incurred have been expensed.\nGuarantees and Indemnification Agreements\nWe follow ASC 460, Guarantees ( ASC 460\u201d). ASC 460 elaborates on the disclosure requirements of a guarantor in its interim and annual consolidated financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also requires a guarantor to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, for those guarantees that are covered by ASC 460, the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing certain guarantees.\nPer Share Information\nIn accordance with ASC 946, senior equity securities, such as preferred stock, are not considered in the calculation of net asset value per share. Net asset value per share also excludes the effects of assumed conversion of outstanding convertible securities, regardless of whether their conversion would have a diluting effect. Therefore, our net asset value is presented on the basis of per common share outstanding as of the applicable period end.\nWe compute earnings per common share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260\u201d). Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the assumed conversion of dilutive securities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOn July 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which amends the financial instruments impairment guidance so that an entity is required to measure expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As such, an entity will use forward-looking information to estimate credit losses. ASU 2016-13 also amends the guidance in FASB ASC Subtopic No. 325-40, Investments-Other, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets, related to the subsequent measurement of accretable yield recognized as interest income over the life of a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets under the effective yield method. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures as our investments are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.\nOn July 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The standard modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding certain disclosures. The adoption of ASU 2018-13 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn May 2020, the SEC adopted rule amendments that will impact the requirement of investment companies, including BDCs, to disclose the financial statements of certain of their portfolio companies or certain acquired funds (the Final Rules\u201d). The Final Rules adopted a new definition of significant subsidiary\u201d set forth in Rule 1-02(w)(2) of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act. Rules 3-09 and 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X require investment companies to include separate financial statements or summary financial information, respectively, in such investment company's periodic reports for any portfolio company that meets the definition of significant subsidiary.\u201d The Final Rules adopt a new definition of significant subsidiary\u201d applicable only to investment companies that (i) modifies the investment test and the income test, and (ii) eliminates the asset test currently in the definition of significant subsidiary\u201d in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X. The new Rule 1-02(w)(2) of Regulation S-X is intended to more accurately capture these portfolio companies that are more likely to materially impact the financial condition of an investment company. The Final Rules became effective on January 1, 2021, but voluntary compliance was permitted in advance of the effective date. We evaluated the impact of adopting the Final Rules on our consolidated financial statements and because the new definition of significant subsidiary\u201d contained therein is specific to investment companies, we elected to early adopt the Final Rules beginning with our fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. Refer to Note 3. in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of significant subsidiary results and disclosures.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The standard is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the optional guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. The Company did not utilize the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the year ended June 30, 2021.\nIn August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity, which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing the separation models for (1) convertible debt with a cash conversion feature and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. As a result, after adoption, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(All figures in this item are in thousands except share, per share and other data.)\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from any results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere herein.\nOverview\nThe terms Prospect,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d mean Prospect Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.\nProspect is a financial services company that primarily lends to and invests in middle-market privately-held companies. We are a closed-end investment company incorporated in Maryland. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act\u201d). As a BDC, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d), under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code\u201d). We were organized on April 13, 2004 and were funded in an initial public offering completed on July 27, 2004.\nOn May 15, 2007, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary Prospect Capital Funding LLC ( PCF\u201d), a Delaware limited liability company and a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which holds certain of our portfolio loan investments that are used as collateral for the revolving credit facility at PCF. Our wholly owned subsidiary Prospect Small Business Lending, LLC ( PSBL\u201d) was formed on January 27, 2014, and purchased small business whole loans from online small business loan originators, including On Deck Capital, Inc. ( OnDeck\u201d). On September 30, 2014, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary Prospect Yield Corporation, LLC ( PYC\u201d) and effective October 23, 2014, PYC holds a portion of our collateralized loan obligations ( CLOs\u201d), which we also refer to as subordinated structured notes ( SSNs\u201d). Each of these subsidiaries have been consolidated since operations commenced.\nWe consolidate certain of our wholly owned and substantially wholly owned holding companies formed by us in order to facilitate our investment strategy. The following companies are included in our consolidated financial statements and are collectively referred to as the Consolidated Holding Companies\u201d: CP Holdings of Delaware LLC ( CP Holdings\u201d); Credit Central Holdings of Delaware, LLC ( Credit Central Delaware\u201d); Energy Solutions Holdings Inc.; First Tower Holdings of Delaware LLC ( First Tower Delaware\u201d); MITY Holdings of Delaware Inc. ( MITY Delaware\u201d); Nationwide Acceptance Holdings LLC; NMMB Holdings, Inc. ( NMMB Holdings\u201d); NPH Property Holdings, LLC ( NPH\u201d); Prospect Opportunity Holdings I, Inc. ( POHI\u201d); SB Forging Company, Inc. ( SB Forging\u201d); STI Holding, Inc.; UTP Holdings Group Inc. ( UTP Holdings\u201d); Valley Electric Holdings I, Inc.( Valley Holdings I\u201d); and Valley Electric Holdings II, Inc. ( Valley Holdings II\u201d).\nWe are externally managed by our investment adviser, Prospect Capital Management L.P. ( Prospect Capital Management\u201d or the Investment Adviser\u201d). Prospect Administration LLC ( Prospect Administration\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Investment Adviser, provides administrative services and facilities necessary for us to operate.\nOur investment objective is to generate both current income and long-term capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in senior and subordinated secured debt and equity of private companies in need of capital for acquisitions, divestitures, growth, development, recapitalizations and other purposes. We work with the management teams or financial sponsors to seek investments with historical cash flows, asset collateral or contracted pro-forma cash flows.\nWe currently have four primary strategies that guide our origination of investment opportunities: (1) lending to companies, including companies controlled by private equity sponsors and not controlled by private equity sponsors, and including both directly-originated loans and syndicated loans, (2) lending to companies and purchasing controlling equity positions in such companies, including both operating companies and financial services companies, (3) purchasing controlling equity positions and lending to real estate companies, and (4) investing in structured credit. We may also invest in other strategies and opportunities from time to time that we view as attractive. We continue to evaluate other origination strategies in the ordinary course of business with no specific top-down allocation to any single origination strategy.\nLending to Companies - We make directly-originated agented loans to companies, including companies which are controlled by private equity sponsors and companies that are not controlled by private equity sponsors (such as companies that are controlled by the management team, the founder, a family or public shareholders). This debt can take the form of first lien, second lien, unitranche or unsecured loans. These loans typically have equity subordinate to our loan position. We may also purchase selected equity co-investments in such companies. In addition to directly-originated, agented loans, we also invest in senior and secured loans, syndicated loans and high yield bonds that have been sold to a club or syndicate of buyers, both in the primary and secondary markets. These investments are often purchased with a long term, buy-and-hold outlook, and we often look to provide significant input to the transaction by providing anchoring orders. Historically, this strategy has compromised approximately 40%-60% of our portfolio.\nLending to Companies and Purchasing Controlling Equity Positions in Such Companies - This strategy involves purchasing senior and secured yield-producing debt and controlling equity positions in operating companies across various industries. We believe this strategy provides enhanced certainty of closure to sellers and the opportunity for management to continue on in their current roles. These investments are often structured in tax-efficient partnerships, enhancing returns. Historically, this strategy has comprised approximately 15%-25% of our portfolio.\nPurchasing Controlling Equity Positions and Lending to Real Estate Companies - We purchase debt and controlling equity positions in tax-efficient real estate investment trusts ( REIT\u201d or REITs\u201d). The real estate investments of National Property REIT Corp. ( NPRC\u201d) are in various classes of developed and occupied real estate properties that generate current yields, including multi-family properties, and student housing. NPRC seeks to identify properties that have historically significant occupancy rates and recurring cash flow generation. NPRC generally co-invests with established and experienced property management teams that manage such properties after acquisition. Additionally, NPRC makes investments in rated secured structured notes (primarily debt of structured credit). NPRC also purchases loans originated by certain consumer loan facilitators. It purchases each loan in its entirety (i.e., a whole loan\u201d). The borrowers are consumers, and the loans are typically serviced by the facilitators of the loans. Historically, this overall investment strategy has comprised approximately 10%-20% of our business.\nInvesting in Structured Credit - We make investments in structured credit, often taking a significant position in subordinated structured notes (equity) and rated secured structured notes (debt). The underlying portfolio of each structured credit investment is diversified across approximately 100 to 200 broadly syndicated loans and does not have direct exposure to real estate, mortgages, or consumer-based credit assets. The structured credit portfolios in which we invest are managed by established collateral management teams with many years of experience in the industry. Historically, this overall strategy has comprised approximately 10%-20% of our portfolio.\nWe invest primarily in first and second lien secured loans and unsecured debt, which in some cases includes an equity component. First and second lien secured loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of unsecured debt of a given portfolio company. These loans also have the benefit of security interests on the assets of the portfolio company, which may rank ahead of or be junior to other security interests. Our investments in structured credit are subordinated to senior loans and are generally unsecured. We invest in debt and equity positions of structured credit which are a form of securitization in which the cash flows of a portfolio of loans are pooled and passed on to different classes of owners in various tranches. Our structured credit investments are derived from portfolios of corporate debt securities which are generally risk rated from BB to B.\nWe hold many of our control investments in a two-tier structure consisting of a holding company and one or more related operating companies for tax purposes. These holding companies serve various business purposes including concentration of management teams, optimization of third party borrowing costs, improvement of supplier, customer, and insurance terms, and enhancement of co-investments by the management teams. In these cases, our investment, which is generally equity in the holding company, the holding company's equity investment in the operating company and any debt from us directly to the operating company structure represents our total exposure for the investment. As of June 30, 2021, as shown in our Consolidated Schedule of Investments, the cost basis and fair value of our investments in controlled companies was $2,482,431 and $2,919,717, respectively. This structure gives rise to several of the risks described in our public documents and highlighted elsewhere in this Annual Report. We consolidate all wholly-owned and substantially wholly-owned holding companies formed by us for the purpose of holding our controlled investments in operating companies. There is no significant effect of consolidating these holding companies as they hold minimal assets other than their investments in the controlled operating companies. Investment company accounting prohibits the consolidation of any operating companies.\nOn June 11, 2021, at a special meeting of stockholders, our stockholders authorized us to sell shares of our common stock (during the next 12 months) at a price or prices below our net asset value per share at the time of sale in one or more offerings subject to certain conditions as set forth in the proxy statement relating to the special meeting (including that the number of shares sold on any given date does not exceed 25% of its outstanding common stock immediately prior to such sale).\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nInvestment Transactions\nWe seek to be a long-term investor with our portfolio companies. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, we acquired $163,168 of new investments, completed follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies totaling approximately $126,420, funded $316 of revolver advances, and recorded PIK interest of $16,771, resulting in gross investment originations of $306,675. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, we received full repayments on investments totaling $105,537, received $50,727 in partial prepayments, and revolver paydowns of $8, resulting in net repayments of $156,272.\nDebt Issuances and Redemptions\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2021, we repaid $1,817 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae at par in accordance with the Survivor's Option, as defined in the InterNotes\u00ae Offering prospectus. In order to replace short maturity debt with longer-term debt, we redeemed $241,580 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae at par with a weighted average interest rate of 4.87%. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a loss in the amount of the unamortized debt issuance costs. The net loss on the extinguishment of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae in the three months ended June 30, 2021 was $2,997.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2021, we issued $78,828 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae with a weighted average stated interest rate of 3.50%, to extend our borrowing base. The newly issued notes mature between April 15, 2026 and July 15, 2033 and generated net proceeds of $77,359.\nOn March 16, 2021, we commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash up to $30,000 aggregate principal outstanding amount of the 2022 Notes at the purchase price of $102.00, plus accrued and unpaid interest ( 2022 Notes March 2021 Tender Offer\u201d). On April 13, 2021, $50 aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes, representing 0.05% of the previously outstanding 2022 Notes, were validly tendered and accepted. The 2022 Notes March 2021 Tender Offer resulted in our recognizing a loss of $1.\nOn April 28, 2021, we amended the 2019 Facility and closed an expanded five year revolving credit facility (the 2021 Facility\u201d and collectively with the 2014 Facility, the 2018 Facility and the 2019 Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The lenders had extended commitments of $1,107,500 as of June 30, 2021. The Revolving Credit Facility includes an accordion feature which allows commitments to be increased up to $1,500,000 in the aggregate. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on April 27, 2026. It includes a revolving period that extends through April 27, 2025, followed by an additional one-year amortization period, with distributions allowed to Prospect after the completion of the revolving period. During such one-year amortization period, all principal payments on the pledged assets will be applied to reduce the balance. At the end of the one-year amortization period, the remaining balance will become due, if required by the lenders.\nOn April 7, 2021, we commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash up to $30,000 aggregate principal amount of the 6.375% 2024 Notes at the purchase price of $107.50, plus accrued and unpaid interest ( 6.375% 2024 Notes April 2021 Tender Offer\u201d). On May 4, 2021, $226 aggregate principal amount of the 6.375% 2024 notes, representing 0.28% of the previously outstanding 6.375% 2024 Notes, were validly tendered and accepted. The 6.375% 2024 Notes April 2021 Tender Offer resulted in our recognizing a loss of $18 during the three months ended June 30, 2021.\nOn April 7, 2021, we commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash up to $30,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes at the purchase price of $104.15, plus accrued and unpaid interest ( 2023 Notes April 2021 Tender Offer\u201d). On May 4, 2021, $836 aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes were tendered, representing 0.29% of the previously outstanding 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes April 2021 Tender Offer resulted in our recognizing a loss of $43 during the three months ended June 30, 2021.\nOn May 27, 2021, we issued $300,000 aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on November 15, 2026 (the 3.364% 2026 Notes\u201d). The 3.364% 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.364% per year, payable semi-annually on November 15, and May 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2021. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 3.364% 2026 Notes, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, were $293,283. As of June 30, 2021, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 3.364% 2026 Notes is $300,000.\nOn June 15, 2021, we redeemed $70,761 of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes. The transaction resulted in our recognizing a loss of $1,934 during the three months ended June 30, 2021. Following the redemption, none of the 2028 Notes remained outstanding.\nEquity Issuances\nOn April 22, 2021, May 20, 2021, and June 17, 2021, we issued 357,521, 344,487, and 317,011 shares of our common stock in connection with the dividend reinvestment plan, respectively.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2021, we issued 2,508,672 shares of our Series A1 Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $57,182, 187,000 shares of our Series A2 Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $4,208, and 108,897 shares of our Series M1 Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $2,662, each excluding offering costs and preferred stock dividend reinvestments.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2021, we issued 1,000 shares of our Series A1 Preferred Stock and 9 shares of our Series M1 Preferred Stock in connection with the preferred stock dividend reinvestment plan.\nInvestment Holdings\nAt June 30, 2021, we have $6,201,778, or 157.2%, of our net assets invested in 124 long-term portfolio investments and CLOs.\nOur annualized current yield was 11.7% and 11.4% as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively, across all performing interest bearing investments, excluding equity investments and non-accrual loans. Our annualized current yield was 9.2% and 9.7% as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively, across all investments. Monetization of equity positions that we hold and loans on non-accrual status are not included in this yield calculation. In many of our portfolio companies we hold equity positions, ranging from minority interests to majority stakes, which we expect over time to contribute to our investment returns. Some of these equity positions include features such as contractual minimum internal rates of returns, preferred distributions, flip structures and other features expected to generate additional investment returns, as well as contractual protections and preferences over junior equity, in addition to the yield and security offered by our cash flow and collateral debt protections.\nWe are a non-diversified company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. As required by the 1940 Act, we classify our investments by level of control. As defined in the 1940 Act, Control Investments\u201d are those where there is the ability or power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company. Control is generally deemed to exist when a company or individual possesses or has the right to acquire within 60 days or less, a beneficial ownership of 25% or more of the voting securities of an investee company. Under the 1940 Act, Affiliate Investments\u201d are defined by a lesser degree of influence and are deemed to exist through the possession outright or via the right to acquire within 60 days or less, beneficial ownership of 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of another person. Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments\u201d are those that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we own controlling interests in the following portfolio companies: CP Energy Services Inc. ( CP Energy\u201d); Credit Central Loan Company, LLC ( Credit Central\u201d); Echelon Transportation, LLC ( Echelon\u201d); First Tower Finance Company LLC ( First Tower Finance\u201d); Freedom Marine Solutions, LLC ( Freedom Marine\u201d); InterDent, Inc.

In June 2019, CP Energy purchased controlling interest of the common equity of Spartan Energy Holdings, Inc. ( Spartan Holdings\u201d), which owns 100% of Spartan Energy Services, LLC ( Spartan\u201d), a portfolio company of Prospect with $15,656 in senior secured term loans (the Spartan Term Loan A\u201d) due to us as of June 30, 2021. As a result of CP Energy's purchase, and given Prospect's controlling interest in CP Energy, we report our investments in Spartan as control investment. Spartan remains the direct borrow and guarantor to Prospect for the Spartan Term Loan A.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we also own affiliated interests in Nixon, Inc. ( Nixon\u201d), PGX Holdings, Inc.

In addition, Revolving Line of Credit and Delayed Draw Term Loans are excluded from the calculation.\nInvestment Valuation\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, management and the independent valuation firm look at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. In determining the range of values for debt instruments where market quotations are not available, except CLOs and debt investments in controlling portfolio companies, management and the independent valuation firm estimated corporate and security credit ratings and identified corresponding yields to maturity for each loan from relevant market data. A discounted cash flow technique was then applied using the appropriate yield to maturity as the discount rate, to determine a range of values. In determining the range of values for debt investments of controlled companies and equity investments, the enterprise value was determined by applying a market approach such as using earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) multiples, net income and/or book value multiples for similar guideline public companies and/or similar recent investment transactions and/or an income approach, such as the discounted cash flow technique. The enterprise value technique may also be used to value debt investments which are credit impaired. For stressed debt and equity investments, asset recovery analysis was used.\nIn determining the range of values for our investments in CLOs, the independent valuation firm uses a discounted multi-path cash flow model. The valuations were accomplished through the analysis of the CLO deal structures to identify the risk exposures from the modeling point of view as well as to determine an appropriate call date (i.e., expected maturity). These risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations, which are simulations used to model the probability of different outcomes, to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows for the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market and certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment. In addition, we generate a single-path cash flow utilizing our best estimate of expected cash receipts, and assess the reasonableness of the implied discount rate that would be effective for the value derived from the corresponding multi-path cash flow model.\nWith respect to our online consumer and SME lending initiative, we invest primarily in marketplace loans through marketplace lending platforms. We do not conduct loan origination activities ourselves. Therefore, our ability to purchase consumer and SME loans, and our ability to grow our portfolio of consumer and SME loans, are directly influenced by the business performance and competitiveness of the marketplace loan origination business of the marketplace lending platforms from which we purchase consumer and SME loans. In addition, our ability to analyze the risk-return profile of consumer and SME loans is significantly dependent on the marketplace platforms' ability to effectively evaluate a borrower's credit profile and likelihood of default. If we are unable to effectively evaluate borrowers' credit profiles or the credit decisioning and scoring models implemented by each platform, we may incur unanticipated losses which could adversely impact our operating results.\nThe Board of Directors looked at several factors in determining where within the range to value the asset including: recent operating and financial trends for the asset, independent ratings obtained from third parties, comparable multiples for recent sales of companies within the industry and discounted cash flow models for our investments in CLOs. The composite of all these various valuation techniques, applied to each investment, was a total valuation of $6,201,778.\nOur portfolio companies are generally lower middle-market companies, outside of the financial sector, with less than $100,000 of annual EBITDA. We believe our investment portfolio has experienced less volatility than others because we believe there are more buy and hold investors who own these less liquid investments.\nImpact of the novel coronavirus (the COVID-19\u201d) pandemic\nAs of June 30, 2021, there remains to be global uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused severe disruptions in the global economy and has negatively impacted the fair value and performance of certain investments since the pandemic began. For the year ended June 30, 2021, the aggregate increases in fair value and net unrealized appreciation on investments were driven by the expansion of comparable company trading multiples and/or tightened credit spreads as the level of market volatility generated by the COVID-19 pandemic declined over the twelve month period. However, for certain investments in our portfolio, the valuations continue to reflect factors such as specific industry concerns, uncertainty about the duration of business shutdowns and near-term liquidity needs. For additional information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Risk Factors - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the global economy, which has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our portfolio companies and our business and operations.\u201d\nControl Company Investments\nControl investments offer increased risk and reward over straight debt investments. Operating results and changes in market multiples can result in dramatic changes in values from quarter to quarter. Significant downturns in operations can further result in our looking to recoveries on sales of assets rather than the enterprise value of the investment. Equity positions in our portfolio are susceptible to potentially significant changes in value, both increases as well as decreases, due to changes in operating results and market multiples. Our controlled companies discussed below experienced such changes and we recorded corresponding fluctuations in valuations during the year ended June 30, 2021.\nEchelon Transportation, LLC\nProspect owns 100% of the equity of Echelon, a consolidated holding company. Echelon owns 60.7% of the equity of AerLift. Echelon is an aircraft leasing company.\nThe fair value of our investment in Echelon decreased to $84,240 as of June 30, 2021, which is a discount of $13,904 from its amortized cost, compared to a fair value of $85,627 as of June 30, 2020, representing a discount of $2,581 to its amortized cost basis. The increase in discount to amortized cost resulted from lower aircraft residual values, as well as an increase in Echelon's cost basis.\nFirst Tower Finance Company LLC\nProspect owns 100% of the equity of First Tower Delaware, a consolidated holding company. First Tower Delaware owns 80.1% of First Tower Finance. First Tower Finance owns 100% of First Tower, LLC ( First Tower\u201d), a multiline specialty finance company.\nThe fair value of our investment in First Tower increased to $592,356 as of June 30, 2021, representing a premium of $236,502 to its amortized cost basis compared to a fair value of $508,465 as of June 30, 2020, a premium of $150,250 to its amortized cost.

The increase in discount to amortized cost resulted from a decline in financial performance, primarily associated with the demand imbalance stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNational Property REIT Corp.\nNPRC is a Maryland corporation and a qualified REIT for federal income tax purposes.

NMMB is an advertising media buying business.\nThe fair value of our investment in NMMB increased to $46,888 as of June 30, 2021, representing a premium of $29,145 to its amortized cost basis, compared to a fair value of $33,668 as of June 30, 2020, representing a premium of $15,774 to its amortized cost basis. The increase to the premium was driven by strong financial performance and expansion of comparable company trading multiples.\nR-V Industries, Inc.\nProspect owns 88.27% of the fully-diluted equity of R-V Industries, Inc. ( R-V\u201d), with R-V management owning the remaining 11.73% of the equity. On December 15, 2020 we restructured our $28,622 Senior Subordinated Note with R-V into a $28,622 Senior Secured Note. No realized gain or loss was recorded as a result of the transaction. R-V is a provider of engineering and manufacturing services to chemical, paper, pharmaceutical, and power industries.\nThe fair value of our investment in R-V increased to $49,693 as of June 30, 2021, representing a premium of $14,205 to its amortized cost basis, compared to a fair value of $38,565 as of June 30, 2020, representing a premium of $3,076 to its amortized cost basis. The increase to the premium was driven by strong financial performance and expansion of comparable company trading multiples.\nUSES Corp.\nProspect owns 99.96% of the equity of USES Corp. as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020. USES provides industrial, environmental, and maritime services in the Gulf States region.\nThe fair value of our investment in USES increased to $33,815 as of June 30, 2021, a discount of $34,404 from its amortized cost basis, compared to a fair value of $17,325 as of June 30, 2020, representing a discount of $48,894 to it amortized cost. The decrease in discount to amortized cost resulted from improved financial performance and expansion of comparable company trading multiples.\nValley Electric Company, Inc.\nProspect owns 100% of the common stock of Valley Holdings I, a Consolidated Holding Company. Valley Holdings I owns 100% of Valley Holdings II, a Consolidated Holding Company. Valley Holdings II owns 94.99% of Valley Electric, with Valley Electric management owning the remaining 5.01% of the equity. Valley Electric owns 100% of the equity of VE Company, Inc., which owns 100% of the equity of Valley Electric Co. of Mt. Vernon, Inc. ( Valley\u201d), a leading provider of specialty electrical services in the state of Washington and among the top electrical contractors in the United States.\nThe fair value of our investment in Valley Electric increased to $149,695 as of June 30, 2021, a premium of $79,760 to its amortized cost, compared to a fair value of $129,296 as of June 30, 2020, representing a $60,422 premium to its amortized cost. The increase in premium to amortized cost was driven by an expansion of comparable company trading multiples.\nOur controlled investments, including those discussed above, are valued at $437,286 above their amortized cost as of June 30, 2021.\nAffiliate and Non-Control Company Investments\nWe hold three affiliate investments at June 30, 2021 with a total fair value of $356,734, a premium of $153,791 from their combined amortized cost compared to a fair value of $187,537 as of June 30, 2020, representing a $24,053 premium to its amortized cost. The increase in premium is primarily driven by our investment in PGX Holdings, Inc. ( Progrexion\u201d), which is valued at a premium of $126,933 at June 30, 2021 compared to a premium of $180 as of June 30, 2020. The increase in Progrexion's premium to amortized cost was driven by strong financial performance.\nWith the non-control/non-affiliate investments, generally, there is less volatility related to our total investments because our equity positions tend to be smaller than with our control/affiliate investments, and debt investments are generally not as susceptible to large swings in value as equity investments. For debt investments, the fair value is generally limited on the high side to each loan's par value, plus any prepayment premium that could be imposed. However, as of June 30, 2021, Engine Group, Inc. ( Engine\u201d) and USC, two of our non-control/non-affiliate investments are valued at discounts to amortized cost of $27,258 and $96,794, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, our CLO investment portfolio is valued at a $334,066 discount to amortized cost. Excluding Engine, USC, and the CLO investment portfolio, the fair value of our non-control/non-affiliate investments at June 30, 2021 increased and are valued at $10,695 above their amortized cost, compared to a discount of $35,674 recorded at June 30, 2020. This increase is driven largely by tightening credit spreads as market participants expected a lower yield on similar investments as the level of volatility generated by the COVID-19 pandemic declined over the twelve month period.\nCapitalization\nOur investment activities are capital intensive and the availability and cost of capital is a critical component of our business. We capitalize our business with a combination of debt and equity. Our debt as of June 30, 2021 consists of: a Revolving Credit Facility availing us of the ability to borrow debt subject to borrowing base determinations; Convertible Notes which we issued in April 2017 (with a follow-on issuance in May 2018) and March 2019; Public Notes which we issued in March 2013, October 2018, December 2018 (and from time to time through our 2029 Notes Follow-on Program), January 2021, and May 2021; and Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae which we issue from time to time. As of June 30, 2021, our equity capital is comprised of common and preferred equity.\nThe following table shows our outstanding debt as of June 30, 2021.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Principal Outstanding </td> <td> </td> <td>Unamortized Discount & Debt Issuance Costs </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Carrying Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Effective Interest Rate </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Credit Facility(2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>356,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>356,937 </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>356,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1ML+2.05% </td> <td>(6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2022 Notes </td> <td>111,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>825 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113,799 </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td>5.69 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2025 Notes </td> <td>156,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>171,590 </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td>6.63 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible Notes </td> <td>267,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>263,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>285,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.375% 2024 Notes </td> <td>81,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,996 </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td>6.57 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023 Notes </td> <td>284,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>282,822 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>302,616 </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td>6.07 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2026 Notes </td> <td>400,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>391,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>413,032 </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td>3.94 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.364% 2026 Notes </td> <td>300,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>292,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300,693 </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td>3.57 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2029 Notes </td> <td>69,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,336 </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td>7.38 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public Notes </td> <td>1,134,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,114,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,176,673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae\n</td> <td>508,711 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,496 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>498,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>591,013 </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td>6.17 </td> <td>% </td> <td>(8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,267,649 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,232,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,410,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)As permitted by ASC 825-10-25, we have not elected to value our Revolving Credit Facility, Convertible Notes, Public Notes and Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae at fair value.

The amounts involved may be material. In addition, we may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue additional debt securities, including secured debt, unsecured debt and/or debt securities convertible into common stock. Any such purchases or exchanges of outstanding debt would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors.\nHistorically, we have funded a portion of our cash needs through borrowings from banks, issuances of senior securities, including secured, unsecured and convertible debt securities, or issuances of common equity. For flexibility, we maintain a universal shelf registration statement that allows for the public offering and sale of our debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, subscription rights, and warrants and units to purchase such securities up to an indeterminate amount. We may from time to time issue securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement or otherwise pursuant to private offerings. The issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors and there can be no assurance that any such issuance will occur or be successful.\nEach of our Convertible Notes, Public Notes and Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae (collectively, our Unsecured Notes\u201d) are our general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured indebtedness and will be senior in right of payment to any of our subordinated indebtedness that may be issued in the future. The Unsecured Notes are effectively subordinated to our existing secured indebtedness, such as our credit facility, and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to any existing and future liabilities and other indebtedness of any of our subsidiaries.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn August 29, 2014, we renegotiated our previous credit facility and closed an expanded five and a half year revolving credit facility (the 2014 Facility\u201d). The lenders had extended commitments of $885,000 under the 2014 Facility as of June 30, 2018. The 2014 Facility included an accordion feature which allowed commitments to be increased up to $1,500,000 in the aggregate. Interest on borrowings under the 2014 Facility was one-month LIBOR plus 225 basis points. Additionally, the lenders charged a fee on the unused portion of the 2014 Facility equal to either 50 basis points if at least 35% of the credit facility was drawn or 100 basis points otherwise.\nOn August 1, 2018, we renegotiated the 2014 Facility and closed an expanded five and a half year revolving credit facility (the 2018 Facility\u201d). The lenders have extended commitments of $1,132,500 as of June 30, 2019. The 2018 Facility included an accordion feature which allowed commitments to be increased up to $1,500,000 in the aggregate.\nOn September 9, 2019, we amended the 2018 Facility and closed an expanded revolving credit facility (the 2019 Facility\u201d). The lenders had extended commitments of $1,077,500 as of March 31, 2021. The 2019 Facility included an accordion feature which allowed commitments to be increased up to $1,500,000 in the aggregate.\nOn April 28, 2021, we amended the 2019 Facility and closed an expanded five year revolving credit facility (the 2021 Facility\u201d and collectively with the 2014 Facility, the 2018 Facility and the 2019 Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The lenders had extended commitments of $1,107,500 as of June 30, 2021. The Revolving Credit Facility includes an accordion feature which allows commitments to be increased up to $1,500,000 in the aggregate. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on April 27, 2026. It includes a revolving period that extends through April 27, 2025, followed by an additional one-year amortization period, with distributions allowed to Prospect after the completion of the revolving period. During such one-year amortization period, all principal payments on the pledged assets will be applied to reduce the balance. At the end of the one-year amortization period, the remaining balance will become due, if required by the lenders.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains restrictions pertaining to the geographic and industry concentrations of funded loans, maximum size of funded loans, interest rate payment frequency of funded loans, maturity dates of funded loans and minimum equity requirements. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain requirements relating to portfolio performance, including required minimum portfolio yield and limitations on delinquencies and charge-offs, violation of which could result in the early termination of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility also requires the maintenance of a minimum liquidity requirement. As of June 30, 2021, we were in compliance with the applicable covenants.\nInterest on borrowings under the 2021 Facility is one-month LIBOR plus 205 basis points. Additionally, the lenders charge a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility equal to either 40 basis points if more than 60% of the credit facility is drawn, or 70 basis points if more than 35% and an amount less than or equal to 60% of the credit facility is drawn, or 150 basis points if an amount less than or equal to 35% of the credit facility is drawn. The 2021 Facility requires us to pledge assets as collateral in order to borrow under the credit facility.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2021, June 30, 2020, and June 30, 2019, the average stated interest rate (i.e., rate in effect plus the spread) and average outstanding borrowings for the Revolving Credit Facility were as follows:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended June 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average stated interest rate </td> <td>2.31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.55 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average outstanding balance </td> <td>$386,848 </td> <td> </td> <td>$222,758 </td> <td> </td> <td>$225,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, we had $640,853 and $545,496, respectively, available to us for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of $356,937 and $237,536 outstanding borrowings as of the respective balance sheet dates. As of June 30, 2021, the investments, including cash and cash equivalents, used as collateral for the Revolving Credit Facility had an aggregate fair value of $1,807,442, which represents 28.8% of our total investments, including cash and cash equivalents. These assets are held and owned by PCF, a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, and, as such, these investments are not available to our general creditors. As additional eligible investments are transferred to PCF and pledged under the Revolving Credit Facility, PCF will generate additional availability up to the current commitment amount of $1,107,500. The release of any assets from PCF requires the approval of the facility agent.\nIn connection with the origination and amendments of the Revolving Credit Facility, we incurred $15,299 of fees and $7,509 were carried over from the previous facilities, all of which are being amortized over the term of the facility in accordance with ASC 470-50. As of June 30, 2021, $11,141 remains to be amortized and is reflected as deferred financing costs on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nDuring the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded $18,208, $21,850 and $23,097, respectively, of interest costs, unused fees and amortization of financing costs on the Revolving Credit Facility as interest expense.\nConvertible Notes\nOn April 11, 2014, we issued $400,000 aggregate principal amount of convertible notes that mature on April 15, 2020 (the 2020 Notes\u201d), unless previously converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The 2020 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.75% per year, payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 each year, beginning October 15, 2014. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2020 Notes, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, were $387,500. On January 30, 2015, we repurchased $8,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes at a price of 93.0, including commissions. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a gain of $332, in the amount of the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the 2020 Notes, net of the proportionate amount of unamortized debt issuance cost. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased an additional $13,500 aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes at a price of 99.5, including commissions.

These companies typically do not issue securities rated investment grade, and have limited resources, limited operating history, and concentrated product lines or customers. These are generally private companies with limited operating information available and are likely to depend on a small core of management talents. Changes in any of these factors can have a significant impact on the value of the portfolio company. These changes, along with those discussed in Investment Valuation above, can cause significant fluctuations in our net change in unrealized gains (losses) from investments, and therefore our net increase (decrease) in nets assets resulting from operations attributable to common stockholders, quarter over quarter.\nInvestment Income\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities that we own, dividend income on any common or preferred stock that we own, and fees generated from the structuring of new deals. Our investments, if in the form of debt securities, will typically have a term of one to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. To the extent achievable, we will seek to collateralize our investments by obtaining security interests in our portfolio companies' assets. We also may acquire minority or majority equity interests in our portfolio companies, which may pay cash or in-kind dividends on a recurring or otherwise negotiated basis. In addition, we may generate revenue in other forms including prepayment penalties and possibly consulting fees. Any such fees generated in connection with our investments are recognized as earned.\nInvestment income consists of interest income, including accretion of loan origination fees and prepayment penalty fees, dividend income and other income, including settlement of net profits interests, overriding royalty interests and structuring fees.\nThe following table describes the various components of investment income and the related levels of debt investments:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended June 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>554,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>554,376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend income </td> <td>5,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income </td> <td>72,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>631,967 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>623,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt principal of performing interest bearing investments(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,460,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,254,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate earned on performing interest bearing investments(1)\n</td> <td>10.15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.55 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average debt principal of all interest bearing investments(2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,799,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,879,597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average interest rate earned on all interest bearing investments(2)\n</td> <td>9.56 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.43 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Excludes equity investments and non-accrual loans.\n(2) Excludes equity investments.\nThe average interest earned on interest bearing performing assets decreased from 10.55% for the year ended June 30, 2020 to 10.15% for the year ended June 30, 2021. The decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in interest income due to a decline in LIBOR, as well as originations at lower rates than our average existing portfolio yield, offset by early repayments causing an increase in accelerated income. The average interest earned on all interest bearing assets increased from 9.43% for the year ended June 30, 2020 to 9.56% for the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase is primarily due to decreases in non-accrual loans.\nInvestment income is also generated from dividends and other income which is less predictable than interest income.

These expenses include our allocable portion of overhead under the Administration Agreement with Prospect Administration under which Prospect Administration provides administrative services and facilities for us. Our investment advisory fees compensate the Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments.

The increase in total gross base management fee is directly related to an increase in average total assets.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we incurred $71,227 and $68,057 of income incentive fees, respectively. This increase was driven by a corresponding increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income, to $356,964 from $333,751 for the years ended June 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively. No capital gains incentive fee has yet been incurred pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. Income incentive fee for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 includes a $264 and $1,306 adjustment for fees earned in prior periods that were neither expensed nor paid to the Investment Adviser.\nDuring the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we incurred $130,618 and $148,368, respectively, of interest and credit facility expenses related to our Revolving Credit Facility, Convertible Notes, Public Notes and Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae (collectively, our Notes\u201d). These expenses are related directly to the leveraging capacity put into place for each of those periods and the levels of indebtedness actually undertaken in those periods.\nThe table below describes the various expenses of our Notes and the related indicators of leveraging capacity and indebtedness during these years.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended June 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on borrowings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,501 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred financing costs </td> <td>7,251 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,580 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accretion of discount on unsecured debt </td> <td>1,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility commitment fees </td> <td>6,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest and credit facility expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average principal debt outstanding </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,336,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,314,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized weighted average stated interest rate on borrowings(1)\n</td> <td>4.94 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.47 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized weighted average interest rate on borrowings(2)\n</td> <td>5.59 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes only the stated interest expense.\n(2)Includes the stated interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, accretion of discount on Public Notes and commitment fees on the undrawn portion of our Revolving Credit Facility.\nInterest expense decreased from $148,368 year ended June 30, 2020 to $130,618 for the year ended June 30, 2021. The weighted average stated interest rate on borrowings (excluding amortization, accretion and undrawn facility fees) decreased from 5.47% for the year ended June 30, 2020 to 4.94% for the year ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to repurchases and early retirements of our Convertible Notes and the issuance of the 2026 Notes and 3.364% 2026 Notes at lower rates.\nThe allocation of net overhead expense from Prospect Administration was $14,262 and $18,247 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Prospect Administration received estimated payments of $1,572 and $1,530 directly from our portfolio companies and certain funds managed by the Investment Adviser for legal services during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, we were given a credit in the amount of $3,522 for legal expenses incurred on behalf of our portfolio companies that were remitted to Prospect Administration during the year ended June 30, 2021. We were given a credit for these payments as a reduction of the administrative services cost payable by us to Prospect Administration. Had Prospect Administration not received these payments, Prospect Administration's charges for its administrative services would have increased by this amount.\nTotal operating expenses, excluding investment advisory fees, interest and credit facility expenses, and allocation of overhead from Prospect Administration ( Other Operating Expenses\u201d), net of any expense reimbursements, were $15,501 and $14,254 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of $1,247 during the year ended June 30, 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses offset by a decrease in legal fees due to a reimbursement from litigation proceeds of previously expensed legal fees.\nNet Realized Gains (Losses)\nThe following table details net realized gains (losses) from investments for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020:\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended June 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portfolio Company </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Edmentum Ultimate Holdings, LLC </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spartan Energy Services, LLC - Term Loan B </td> <td>2,832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CCPI, Inc. </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,366 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rated Secured Structured Note Portfolio </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,885 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New Century Transportation, Inc. </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>449 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Voya CLO 2012-2, Ltd. </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(450) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PeopleConnect Holdings, LLC </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(522) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Madison Park Funding XI, Ltd. </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,949) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Easy Gardener </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,719) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net </td> <td>236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>366 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains (losses) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,574) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Realized Losses from Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, we recorded a net realized loss from the extinguishment of debt of $23,511 and $2,702, respectively.

Furthermore, in the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board ( ARRC\u201d) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. On August 24, 2017, the Federal Reserve Board requested public comment on a proposal by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in cooperation with the Office of Financial Research, to produce three new reference rates intended to serve as alternatives to LIBOR. These alternative rates are based on overnight repurchase agreement transactions secured by U.S. Treasury Securities. On December 12, 2017, following consideration of public comments, the Federal Reserve Board concluded that the public would benefit if the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published the three proposed reference rates as alternatives to LIBOR (the Federal Reserve Board Notice\u201d). In April 2018, the Federal Reserve System, in conjunction with the ARRC, announced the replacement of LIBOR with a new index, calculated by short term repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ( SOFR\u201d). On June 12, 2019, the Staff from the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance, Division of Investment Management, Division of Trading and Markets, and Office of the Chief Accountant issued a statement about the potentially significant effects on financial markets and market participants when LIBOR is discontinued in 2021 and no longer available as a reference benchmark rate. The Staff encouraged all market participants to identify contracts that reference LIBOR and begin transitions to alternative rates. Although SOFR appears to be the preferred replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR, at this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United States, United Kingdom or elsewhere or, whether the COVID-19 will have further effect on LIBOR transition plans. The elimination of LIBOR or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations.\nAt this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of the FCA Announcement or other regulatory changes or announcements, any establishment of any alternative reference rates, including SOFR and its market acceptance, or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our net investment income cannot yet be determined. The CLOs in which the Company is invested generally contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by requiring the CLO administrator to calculate a replacement rate primarily through dealer polling on the applicable measurement date. However, there is uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of the dealer polling processes, including the willingness of banks to provide such quotations, which could adversely impact our net investment income. Recently, the CLOs we are invested in have included, or have been amended to include, language permitting the CLO investment manager to implement a market replacement rate (like SOFR) upon the occurrence of certain material disruption events. However, we cannot ensure that all CLOs in which we are invested will have such provisions, nor can we ensure the CLO investment managers will undertake the suggested amendments when able. In addition, the effect of a phase out of LIBOR on U.S. senior secured loans, the underlying assets of the CLOs in which we invest, is currently unclear. To the extent that any replacement rate utilized for senior secured loans differs from that utilized for a CLO that holds those loans, the CLO would experience an interest rate mismatch between its assets and liabilities which could have an adverse impact on the Company's net investment income and portfolio returns.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, our operating activities provided $31,019 and $429,438 of cash, respectively. There were no investing activities for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Financing activities used $11,970 and $491,975 of cash during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which included dividend payments of $195,574 and $239,954, respectively.\nOur primary uses of funds have been to continue to invest in portfolio companies, through both debt and equity investments, repay outstanding borrowings and to make cash distributions to our stockholders.\nOur primary sources of funds have historically been issuances of debt and equity. More recently, we have and may continue to fund a portion of our cash needs through repayments and opportunistic sales of our existing investment portfolio. We may also securitize a portion of our investments in unsecured or senior secured loans or other assets. Our objective is to put in place such borrowings in order to enable us to expand our portfolio. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we borrowed $1,092,861 and we made repayments totaling $973,460 under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2021, our outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility was $356,937. As of June 30, 2021, we had, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, $263,100 outstanding on the Convertible Notes, $1,114,717 outstanding on the Public Notes, and $498,215 outstanding on the Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae (See Capitalization\u201d above).\nUndrawn committed revolvers and delayed draw term loans to our portfolio companies incur commitment and unused fees ranging from 0.00% to 5.00%. As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, we had $67,385 and $41,487, respectively, of undrawn revolver and delayed draw term loan commitments to our portfolio companies. The fair value of our undrawn committed revolvers and delayed draw term loans was zero as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020.\nWe have guaranteed $2,737 in standby letters of credit issued through a financial intermediary and $2,775 of equipment lease obligations on behalf of InterDent, Inc. ( InterDent\u201d) as of June 30, 2021. Under these arrangements, we would be required to make payments to the financial intermediary or equipment lease provider, respectively, if InterDent was to default on their related payment obligations. As of June 30, 2021, we have not recorded a liability on the statement of assets and liabilities for these guarantees as the likelihood of default on the standby letters of credit or equipment lease is deemed to be remote.\nOn February 13, 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-236415) that was effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act as permitted under the Small Business Credit Availability Act. The registration statement permits us to issue, through one or more transactions, an indeterminate amount of securities, consisting of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, subscription rights to purchase our securities, warrants representing rights to purchase our securities or separately tradeable units combining two or more of our securities.\nPreferred Stock\nOn August 3, 2020, we entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement with Preferred Capital Securities, LLC ( PCS\u201d), pursuant to which PCS has agreed to serve as the Company's agent, principal distributor and dealer manager for the Company's offering of up to 40,000,000 shares, par value $0.001 per share, of preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. Such preferred stock will initially be issued in multiple series, including the Series A1 Preferred Stock, the Series M1 Preferred Stock, and the Series M2 Preferred Stock. In connection with such offering, on August 3, 2020, we filed Articles Supplementary with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, reclassifying and designating 120,000,000 shares of the Company's authorized and unissued shares of common stock into shares of preferred stock as Convertible Preferred Stock.\u201d On October 30, 2020, we entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement with InspereX LLC, pursuant to which InspereX LLC has agreed to serve as the Company's agent and dealer manager for the Company's offering of up to 10,000,000 shares, par value $0.001 per share, of 5.50% Series AA1 Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. In connection with such offering, on October 30, 2020, we filed Articles Supplementary with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, reclassifying and designating an additional 20,000,000 shares of the Company's authorized and unissued shares of common stock into shares of preferred stock as Convertible Preferred Stock. On May 19, 2021, we entered into an Underwriting Agreement with UBS Securities LLC, relating to the offer and sale of 187,000 shares, par value $0.001 per share, of 5.50% Series A2 Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. The issuance of the Series A2 Preferred Stock settled on May 26, 2021. In connection with such offering, on May 19, 2021, we filed Articles Supplementary with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, reclassifying and designating an additional 1,000,000 shares of the Company's authorized and unissued shares of common stock into shares of preferred stock as Convertible Preferred Stock.\nIn connection with the offerings of the 5.50% Preferred Stock, we adopted and amended, respectively, a preferred stock dividend reinvestment plan (the Preferred Stock Plan\u201d or the Preferred Stock DRIP\u201d), pursuant to which holders of the 5.50% Preferred Stock will have dividends on their 5.50% Preferred Stock automatically reinvested in additional shares of such 5.50% Preferred Stock at a price per share of $25.00, if they elect.\nEach series of 5.50% Preferred Stock ranks (with respect to the payment of dividends and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) (a) senior to our common stock, (b) on parity with each other series of our preferred stock, and (c) junior to our existing and future secured and unsecured indebtedness. See Note 8, Fair Value and Maturity of Debt Outstanding for further discussion on our senior securities.\nAt any time prior to the listing of the 5.50% Preferred Stock on a national securities exchange, shares of the 5.50% Preferred Stock are convertible, at the option of the holder of the 5.50% Preferred Stock (the Holder Optional Conversion\u201d). We will settle any Holder Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the Settlement Amount (as defined below) that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average price of shares of our common stock over each of the five consecutive trading days ending on the Holder Conversion Exercise Date (as defined in the applicable prospectus supplement)(such arithmetic average, the 5-day VWAP\u201d). For the Series A1 Preferred Stock, the Series AA1 Preferred Stock, and the Series A2 Preferred Stock, Settlement Amount\u201d means (A) $25.00 per share (the Stated Value\u201d), plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the Holder Conversion Exercise Date, minus (C) the Holder Optional Conversion Fee (as described in the prospectus supplements relating to the Series A1 Preferred Stock, the Series AA1 Preferred Stock, or the Series A2 Preferred\nStock, as applicable) applicable on the respective Holder Conversion Deadline (as defined in the applicable prospectus supplement). For the Series M Preferred Stock, Settlement Amount\u201d means (A) the Stated Value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the Holder Conversion Exercise Date, minus (C) the applicable Series M Clawback, if any (as described in the prospectus supplements relating to the Series M Preferred Stock. Series M Clawback,\u201d if applicable, means an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all dividends, whether paid or accrued, on such share of Series M Stock in the three full months prior to the Holder Conversion Exercise Date. Subject to certain limited exceptions, we will not pay any portion of the Settlement Amount in cash (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock) until the five year anniversary of the date on which a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock has been issued. Beginning on the five year anniversary of the date on which a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock is issued, we may elect to settle all or a portion of any Holder Optional Conversion in cash without limitation or restriction. The right of holders to convert a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock will terminate upon the listing of such share on a national securities exchange.\nSubject to certain limited exceptions allowing earlier redemption, beginning on the earlier of the five year anniversary of the date on which a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock has been issued, or, for listed shares of 5.50% Preferred Stock, five years from the earliest date on which any series that has been listed was first issued (the earlier of such dates, the Redemption Eligibility Date\u201d), such share of 5.50% Preferred Stock may be redeemed at any time or from time to time at our option (the Issuer Optional Redemption\u201d), at a redemption price of 100% of the Stated Value of the shares of 5.50% Preferred Stock to be redeemed plus unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption.\nSubject to certain limitations, each share of 5.50% Preferred Stock may be converted at our option (the Issuer Optional Conversion\u201d). We will settle any Issuer Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount (as defined below) that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the IOC Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the 5-day VWAP, subject to our ability to obtain or maintain any stockholder approval that may be required under the 1940 Act to permit us to sell our common stock below net asset value if the 5-day VWAP represents a discount to our net asset value per share of common stock. For the 5.50% Preferred Stock, IOC Settlement Amount\u201d means (A) the Stated Value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the date fixed for conversion. Subject to certain limited exceptions, we will not exercise an Issuer Optional Conversion with respect to a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock until after the date set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement with respect to the 5.50% Preferred Stock. In connection with an Issuer Optional Conversion, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or maintain any stockholder approval that may be required under the 1940 Act to permit us to sell our common stock below net asset value. If we do not have or obtain any required stockholder approval under the 1940 Act to sell our common stock below net asset value and the 5-day VWAP is at a discount to our net asset value per share of common stock, we will settle any conversions in connection with an Issuer Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the IOC Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the NAV per share of common stock at the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the date of conversion. We will not pay any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount from an Issuer Optional Conversion in cash (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock) until the Redemption Eligibility Date. Beginning on the Redemption Eligibility Date, we may elect to settle any Issuer Optional Conversion in cash without limitation or restriction. In the event that we exercise an Issuer Optional Conversion with respect to any shares of 5.50% Preferred Stock, the holder of such 5.50% Preferred Stock may instead elect a Holder Optional Conversion with respect to such 5.50% Preferred Stock provided that the date of conversion for such Holder Optional Conversion would occur prior to the date of conversion for an Issuer Optional Conversion.\nWe determined the estimated value as of June 30, 2021 of our 5.50% Preferred Stock, with a $25.00 stated value per share. We engaged a third-party valuation service to assist in our determination based on the calculation resulting from the total equity on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 (the Form 10-K\u201d), which was prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, adjusted for the fair value of our investments (i.e. from our Consolidated Schedule of Investments) and total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of our 5.50% Preferred Stock outstanding. Based on this methodology and because the result from the calculation above is greater than the $25.00 per share stated value of our Preferred Stock, the estimated value of our Preferred Stock as of June 30, 2021 is $25.00 per share.\nCommon Stock\nOur common stockholders' equity accounts as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 reflect cumulative shares issued, net of shares repurchased, as of those respective dates. Our common stock has been issued through public offerings, a registered direct offering, the exercise of over-allotment options on the part of the underwriters, our dividend reinvestment plan and in connection with the acquisition of certain controlled portfolio companies. When our common stock is issued, the related\noffering expenses have been charged against paid-in capital in excess of par. All underwriting fees and offering expenses were borne by us.\nWe did not repurchase any shares of our common stock for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of June 30, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet liabilities or other contractual obligations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, other than those which originate from 1) the investment advisory and management agreement and the administration agreement and 2) the portfolio companies.\nRecent Developments\nOn July 12, 2021, we entered into an underwriting agreement by and among us, Prospect Capital Management L.P., Prospect Administration LLC, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets, LLC and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the underwriters, relating to the offer and sale of 6,000,000 shares, or $150,000 in aggregate liquidation preference, of our 5.35% Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the 5.35% Preferred Stock\u201d), at a public offering price of $25.00 per share. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 shares of 5.35% Preferred Stock solely to cover over-allotments. The offering closed on July 19, 2021.\nOn July 21, 2021, we funded total commitments of $202,931, comprised of a $49,000 first lien senior secured floating rate term loan and a $153,931 second lien senior secured floating rate term loan, to support the refinancing of PGX Holdings, Inc., a portfolio company of H.I.G. Capital, LLC and market leading provider of consumer credit repair services in the U.S. In connection with the refinancing, our $47,773 first lien senior secured term loan, $18,164 1.5 lien senior secured term loan and $122,271 second lien senior secured term loan outstanding with PGX Holdings, Inc. were fully repaid at par.\nDuring the period of July 14, 2021 through August 13, 2021, we provided notice to call certain of our Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae at par with the following terms:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notice Date </td> <td>Settlement Date </td> <td>Maturity Date Range </td> <td>Interest Rate Range </td> <td>Principal </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7/14/2021 </td> <td>7/21/2021 </td> <td>1/15/2026 - 5/15/2029 </td> <td>4.000% - 6.250% </td> <td>$68,422 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7/15/2021 </td> <td>8/15/2021 </td> <td>2/15/2024 </td> <td>5.750% - 6.000% </td> <td>$4,880 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>8/4/2021 </td> <td>8/11/2021 </td> <td>12/15/2027 - 12/15/2030 </td> <td>4.500% - 6.000% </td> <td>$54,831 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>8/13/2021 </td> <td>9/15/2021 </td> <td>3/15/2024 </td> <td>5.750% </td> <td>$2,581 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn August 19, 2021, we increased total commitments to our Revolving Credit Facility by $50,000 to $1,157,500 in the aggregate.\nDuring the period from July 1, 2021 through August 24, 2021, we issued $61,137 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae for net proceeds of $59,648, with $9,170 of such aggregate principal amount scheduled to settle on August 26, 2021.\nOn August 24, 2021, we announced the declaration of monthly dividends for our 5.50% Preferred Stock for holders of record on the following dates based on an annual rate equal to 5.50% of the Stated Value of $25.00 per share as set forth in the Articles Supplementary for the 5.50% Preferred Stock, from the date of issuance or, if later from the most recent dividend payment date, as follows:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Monthly Cash 5.50% Preferred Shareholder Distribution </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td>Payment Date </td> <td>Monthly Amount ($ per share), before pro ration for partial periods </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 2021 </td> <td>9/15/2021 </td> <td>10/1/2021 </td> <td>$0.114583 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 2021 </td> <td>10/20/2021 </td> <td>11/1/2021 </td> <td>$0.114583 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 2021 </td> <td>11/17/2021 </td> <td>12/1/2021 </td> <td>$0.114583 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn August 24, 2021, we announced the declaration of quarterly dividends for our 5.35% Preferred Stock for holders of record on the following dates based on an annual rate equal to 5.35% of the Stated Value of $25.00 per share as set forth in the Articles Supplementary for the 5.35% Preferred Stock, from the date of issuance or, if later from the most recent dividend payment date, as follows:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarterly Cash 5.35% Preferred Shareholder Distribution </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td>Payment Date </td> <td>Amount ($ per share) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>July - October 2021 </td> <td>10/20/2021 </td> <td>11/1/2021 </td> <td>$0.382674 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn August 24, 2021, we announced the declaration of monthly dividends on our common stock as follows:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Monthly Cash Common Shareholder Distribution </td> <td>Record Date </td> <td>Payment Date </td> <td>Amount ($ per share) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 2021 </td> <td>9/28/2021 </td> <td>10/21/2021 </td> <td>$0.06 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 2021 </td> <td>10/27/2021 </td> <td>11/18/2021 </td> <td>$0.06 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K, ASC 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies ( ASC 946\u201d), and Articles 3, 6 and 12 of Regulation S-X. Under the 1940 Act, ASC 946, and the regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company or an operating company which provides substantially all of its services to benefit us. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Prospect, PCF, PSBL, PYC, and the Consolidated Holding Companies. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial results of our non-substantially wholly-owned holding companies and operating portfolio company investments are not consolidated in the financial statements. Any operating companies owned by the Consolidated Holding Companies are not consolidated.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made in the presentation of prior consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to conform to the presentation as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income, expenses, and gains and losses during the reported period. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, creditworthiness of the issuers of our investment portfolio and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ, and these differences could be material.\nInvestment Classification\nWe are a non-diversified company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. As required by the 1940 Act, we classify our investments by level of control. As defined in the 1940 Act, Control Investments\u201d are those where there is the ability or power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company. Control is generally deemed to exist when a company or individual possesses or has the right to acquire within 60 days or less, a beneficial ownership of more than 25% of the voting securities of an investee company. Under the 1940 Act, Affiliate Investments\u201d are defined by a lesser degree of influence and are deemed to exist through the possession outright or via the right to acquire within 60 days or less, beneficial ownership of 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of another person. Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments\u201d are those that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.\nAs a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets\u201d specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, our qualifying assets as a percentage of total assets, stood at 76.31% and 74.44%, respectively.\nInvestment Transactions\nInvestments are recognized when we assume an obligation to acquire a financial instrument and assume the risks for gains or losses related to that instrument. Specifically, we record all security transactions on a trade date basis. Investments are derecognized when we assume an obligation to sell a financial instrument and forego the risks for gains or losses related to that instrument. Amounts for investments traded but not yet settled are reported in Due to Broker or Due from Broker, in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nForeign Currency\nForeign currency amounts are translated into US Dollars (USD) on the following basis:\ni.fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities-at the spot exchange rate on the last business day of the period; and\nii.purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses-at the rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such investment transactions, income or expenses.\nWe do not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair values of investments held or disposed of during the period. Such fluctuations are included within the net realized and net change in unrealized gains or losses from investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInvestment Risks\nOur investments are subject to a variety of risks. Those risks include the following:\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the fair value of the financial instrument.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk represents the risk that we would incur if the counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their agreements with us.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk represents the possibility that we may not be able to rapidly adjust the size of our investment positions in times of high volatility and financial stress at a reasonable price.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk represents a change in interest rates, which could result in an adverse change in the fair value of an interest-bearing financial instrument.\nPrepayment Risk\nMany of our debt investments allow for prepayment of principal without penalty. Downward changes in interest rates may cause prepayments to occur at a faster than expected rate, thereby effectively shortening the maturity of the security and making us less likely to fully earn all of the expected income of that security and reinvesting in a lower yielding instrument.\nStructured Credit Related Risk\nCLO investments may be riskier and less transparent to us than direct investments in underlying companies. CLOs typically will have no significant assets other than their underlying senior secured loans. Therefore, payments on CLO investments are and will be payable solely from the cash flows from such senior secured loans.\nOnline Small-and-Medium-Sized Business Lending Risk\nWith respect to our online small-and-medium-sized business ( SME\u201d) lending initiative, we invest primarily in marketplace loans through marketplace lending platforms (e.g. OnDeck). We do not conduct loan origination activities\nourselves. Therefore, our ability to purchase SME loans, and our ability to grow our portfolio of SME loans, is directly influenced by the business performance and competitiveness of the marketplace loan origination business of the marketplace lending platforms from which we purchase SME loans. In addition, our ability to analyze the risk-return profile of SME loans is significantly dependent on the marketplace platforms' ability to effectively evaluate a borrower's credit profile and likelihood of default. If we are unable to effectively evaluate borrowers' credit profiles or the credit decisioning and scoring models implemented by each platform, we may incur unanticipated losses which could adversely impact our operating results.\nForeign Currency\nInvestments denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency transactions may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with those of domestic origin. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities.\nInvestment Valuation\nAs a BDC, and in accordance with the 1940 Act, we fair value our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis, with any unrealized gains and losses reflected in net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. To value our investments, we follow the guidance of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ( ASC 820\u201d), that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in conformity with GAAP, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. In accordance with ASC 820, the fair value of our investments is defined as the price that we would receive upon selling an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market in which that investment is transacted.\nASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nIn all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment.\nOur Board of Directors has established procedures for the valuation of our investment portfolio. These procedures are detailed below.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations.\nFor most of our investments, market quotations are not available. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, our Board of Directors has approved a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below.\n1.Each portfolio company or investment is reviewed by our investment professionals with independent valuation firms engaged by our Board of Directors.\n2.The independent valuation firms prepare independent valuations for each investment based on their own independent assessments and issue their report.\n3.The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and discusses with the independent valuation firms the valuation reports, and then makes a recommendation to the Board of Directors of the value for each investment.\n4.The Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser, the respective independent valuation firm and the Audit Committee.\nOur non-CLO investments are valued utilizing a yield technique, enterprise value ( EV\u201d) technique, net asset value technique, asset recovery technique, discounted cash flow technique, or a combination of techniques, as appropriate. The yield technique uses loan spreads for loans and other relevant information implied by market data involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Under the EV technique, the EV of a portfolio company is first determined and allocated over the portfolio company's securities in order of their preference relative to one another (i.e., waterfall\u201d allocation). To determine the EV, we typically use a market (multiples) valuation approach that considers relevant and applicable market trading data of guideline public companies, transaction metrics from precedent merger and acquisitions transactions, and/or a discounted cash flow technique. The net asset value technique, an income approach, is used to derive a value of an underlying investment (such as real estate property) by dividing a relevant earnings stream by an appropriate capitalization rate. For this purpose, we consider capitalization rates for similar properties as may be obtained from guideline public companies and/or relevant transactions. The asset recovery technique is intended to approximate the net recovery value of an investment based on, among other things, assumptions regarding liquidation proceeds based on a hypothetical liquidation of a portfolio company's assets. The discounted cash flow technique converts future cash flows or earnings to a range of fair values from which a single estimate may be derived utilizing an appropriate discount rate. The fair value measurement is based on the net present value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts.\nIn applying these methodologies, additional factors that we consider in valuing our investments may include, as we deem relevant: security covenants, call protection provisions, and information rights; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company's ability to make payments; the principal markets in which the portfolio company does business; publicly available financial ratios of peer companies; the principal market; and enterprise values, among other factors.\nOur investments in CLOs are classified as Level 3 fair value measured securities under ASC 820 and are valued using a discounted multi-path cash flow model. The CLO structures are analyzed to identify the risk exposures and to determine an appropriate call date (i.e., expected maturity). These risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations, which is a simulation used to model the probability of different outcomes, to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows from the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market as well as certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment. In addition, we generate a single-path cash flow utilizing our best estimate of expected cash receipts, and assess the reasonableness of the implied discount rate that would be effective for the value derived from the multi-path cash flows. We are not responsible for and have no influence over the asset management of the portfolios underlying the CLO investments we hold, as those portfolios are managed by non-affiliated third-party CLO collateral managers. The main risk factors are default risk, prepayment risk, interest rate risk, downgrade risk, and credit spread risk.\nValuation of Other Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nASC 825, Financial Instruments, specifically ASC 825-10-25, permits an entity to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value (the Fair Value Option\u201d). We have not elected the Fair Value Option to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities. See Note 8 in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for the disclosure of the fair value of our outstanding debt and the market observable inputs used in determining fair value.\nConvertible Notes\nWe have recorded the Convertible Notes at their contractual amounts. We have determined that the embedded conversion options in the Convertible Unsecured Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. See Note 5 in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nRevenue Recognition\nRealized gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated using the specific identification method.\nInterest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis. Original issue discounts and market discounts are capitalized and accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans using the effective interest method or straight-line, as applicable, and adjusted only for material amendments or prepayments. Upon a prepayment of a loan, prepayment premiums, original issue discount, or market discounts are recorded as interest income.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Unpaid accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans are either applied to the cost basis or interest income, depending upon management's judgment of the collectibility of the loan receivable. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and in\nmanagement's judgment, is likely to remain current and future principal and interest collections when due are probable. Interest received and applied against cost while a loan is on non-accrual, and PIK interest capitalized but not recognized while on non-accrual, is recognized prospectively on the effective yield basis through maturity of the loan when placed back on accrual status, to the extent deemed collectible by management. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 0.6% of our total assets at fair value are in non-accrual status.\nSome of our loans and other investments may have contractual payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest or dividends. PIK income computed at the contractual rate is accrued into income and reflected as receivable up to the capitalization date. PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities. When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued. On these payment dates, we capitalize the accrued interest (reflecting such amounts in the basis as additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. At the point that we believe PIK is not fully expected to be realized, the PIK investment will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are reversed from the related receivable through interest or dividend income, respectively. We do not reverse previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends. Upon capitalization, PIK is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments. PIK investments on non-accrual status are restored to accrual status if we believe that PIK is expected to be realized.\nInterest income from investments in Subordinated Structured Notes (typically preferred shares, income notes or subordinated notes of CLO funds) and equity\u201d class of security of securitized trust is recorded based upon an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed cash flows in accordance with ASC 325-40, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. We monitor the expected cash inflows from our CLO and securitized trust equity investments, including the expected residual payments, and the effective yield is determined and updated periodically.\nDividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.\nOther income generally includes amendment fees, commitment fees, administrative agent fees and structuring fees which are recorded when earned. Excess deal deposits, net profits interests and overriding royalty interests are included in other income. See Note 10 in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nFederal and State Income Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC and intend to continue to comply with the requirements of the Code applicable to RICs. We are required to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and intend to distribute (or retain through a deemed distribution) all of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain to stockholders; therefore, we have made no provision for income taxes. The character of income and gains that we will distribute is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP. Book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified to paid-in capital.\nIf we do not distribute (or are not deemed to have distributed) at least 98% of our annual ordinary income and 98.2% of our capital gains in the calendar year earned, we will generally be required to pay an excise tax equal to 4% of the amount by which 98% of our annual ordinary income and 98.2% of our capital gains exceed the distributions from such taxable income for the year. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income, we accrue excise taxes, if any, on estimated excess taxable income. As of June 30, 2021, we do not expect to have any excise tax due for the 2021 calendar year. Thus, we have not accrued any excise tax for this period.\nIf we fail to satisfy the annual distribution requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would we be required to make distributions. Distributions would generally be taxable to our individual and other non-corporate taxable stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the reduced maximum rate applicable to qualified dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, provided certain holding period and other requirements are met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributions would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. To qualify again to be taxed as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to distribute to our stockholders our accumulated earnings and profits attributable to non-RIC years. In addition, if we failed to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, then, in order to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to elect to recognize and pay tax on any net built-in gain (the excess of aggregate gain, including items of income, over aggregate loss that would have been realized if we had been liquidated) or, alternatively, be subject to taxation on such built-in gain recognized for a period of five years.\nWe follow ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. As of June 30, 2021, we did not record any unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities. Management's determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an on-going analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. Although we file both federal and state income tax returns, our major tax jurisdiction is federal. Our federal tax returns for the tax years ended August 31, 2018 and thereafter remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.\nDividends and Distributions\nDividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount, if any, to be paid as a monthly dividend or distribution is approved by our Board of Directors quarterly and is generally based upon our management's estimate of our future taxable earnings. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually.\nOur distributions may exceed our earnings, and therefore, portions of the distributions that we make may be a return of the money originally invested and represent a return of capital distribution to shareholders for tax purposes.\nFinancing Costs\nWe record origination expenses related to our Revolving Credit Facility and the Unsecured Notes as deferred financing costs. These expenses are deferred and amortized as part of interest expense using the straight-line method over the stated life of the obligation for our Revolving Credit Facility and for our Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae. The effective interest method is used to amortize deferred financing costs for our remaining Unsecured Notes over the respective expected life or maturity. In the event that we modify or extinguish our debt before maturity, we follow the guidance in ASC 470-50, Modification and Extinguishments ( ASC 470-50\u201d). For modifications to or exchanges of our Revolving Credit Facility, any unamortized deferred costs relating to lenders who are not part of the new lending group are expensed. For extinguishments of our Unsecured Notes, any unamortized deferred costs are deducted from the carrying amount of the debt in determining the gain or loss from the extinguishment.\nUnamortized deferred financing costs are presented as a direct deduction to the respective Unsecured Notes (see Notes 5, 6, and 7 in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).\nWe may record registration expenses related to shelf filings as prepaid expenses. These expenses consist principally of SEC registration fees, legal fees and accounting fees incurred. These prepaid expenses are charged to capital upon the receipt of proceeds from an equity offering or charged to expense if no offering is completed. As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, there are no prepaid expenses related to registration expenses and all amounts incurred have been expensed.\nGuarantees and Indemnification Agreements\nWe follow ASC 460, Guarantees ( ASC 460\u201d). ASC 460 elaborates on the disclosure requirements of a guarantor in its interim and annual consolidated financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also requires a guarantor to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, for those guarantees that are covered by ASC 460, the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing certain guarantees.\nPer Share Information\nIn accordance with ASC 946, senior equity securities, such as preferred stock, are not considered in the calculation of net asset value per share. Net asset value per share also excludes the effects of assumed conversion of outstanding convertible securities, regardless of whether their conversion would have a diluting effect. Therefore, our net asset value is presented on the basis of per common share outstanding as of the applicable period end.\nWe compute earnings per common share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260\u201d). Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the assumed conversion of dilutive securities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOn July 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which amends the financial instruments impairment guidance so that an entity is required to measure expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As such, an entity will use forward-looking information to estimate credit losses. ASU 2016-13 also amends the guidance in FASB ASC Subtopic No. 325-40, Investments-Other, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets, related to the subsequent measurement of accretable yield recognized as interest income over the life of a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets under the effective yield method. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures as our investments are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.\nOn July 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The standard modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding certain disclosures. The adoption of ASU 2018-13 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn May 2020, the SEC adopted rule amendments that will impact the requirement of investment companies, including BDCs, to disclose the financial statements of certain of their portfolio companies or certain acquired funds (the Final Rules\u201d). The Final Rules adopted a new definition of significant subsidiary\u201d set forth in Rule 1-02(w)(2) of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act. Rules 3-09 and 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X require investment companies to include separate financial statements or summary financial information, respectively, in such investment company's periodic reports for any portfolio company that meets the definition of significant subsidiary.\u201d The Final Rules adopt a new definition of significant subsidiary\u201d applicable only to investment companies that (i) modifies the investment test and the income test, and (ii) eliminates the asset test currently in the definition of significant subsidiary\u201d in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X. The new Rule 1-02(w)(2) of Regulation S-X is intended to more accurately capture these portfolio companies that are more likely to materially impact the financial condition of an investment company. The Final Rules became effective on January 1, 2021, but voluntary compliance was permitted in advance of the effective date. We evaluated the impact of adopting the Final Rules on our consolidated financial statements and because the new definition of significant subsidiary\u201d contained therein is specific to investment companies, we elected to early adopt the Final Rules beginning with our fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. Refer to Note 3. in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of significant subsidiary results and disclosures.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The standard is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the optional guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. The Company did not utilize the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the year ended June 30, 2021.\nIn August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity, which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing the separation models for (1) convertible debt with a cash conversion feature and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. As a result, after adoption, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(All figures in this item are in thousands except share, per share and other data.)\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this Annual Report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from any results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing elsewhere herein.\nOverview\nThe terms Prospect,\u201d the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d and our\u201d mean Prospect Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise.\nProspect is a financial services company that primarily lends to and invests in middle-market privately-held companies. We are a closed-end investment company incorporated in Maryland. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act\u201d). As a BDC, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC\u201d), under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code\u201d). We were organized on April 13, 2004 and were funded in an initial public offering completed on July 27, 2004.\nOn May 15, 2007, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary Prospect Capital Funding LLC ( PCF\u201d), a Delaware limited liability company and a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, which holds certain of our portfolio loan investments that are used as collateral for the revolving credit facility at PCF. Our wholly owned subsidiary Prospect Small Business Lending, LLC ( PSBL\u201d) was formed on January 27, 2014, and purchased small business whole loans from online small business loan originators, including On Deck Capital, Inc. ( OnDeck\u201d). On September 30, 2014, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary Prospect Yield Corporation, LLC ( PYC\u201d) and effective October 23, 2014, PYC holds a portion of our collateralized loan obligations ( CLOs\u201d), which we also refer to as subordinated structured notes ( SSNs\u201d). Each of these subsidiaries have been consolidated since operations commenced.\nWe consolidate certain of our wholly owned and substantially wholly owned holding companies formed by us in order to facilitate our investment strategy. The following companies are included in our consolidated financial statements and are collectively referred to as the Consolidated Holding Companies\u201d: CP Holdings of Delaware LLC ( CP Holdings\u201d); Credit Central Holdings of Delaware, LLC ( Credit Central Delaware\u201d); Energy Solutions Holdings Inc.; First Tower Holdings of Delaware LLC ( First Tower Delaware\u201d); MITY Holdings of Delaware Inc. ( MITY Delaware\u201d); Nationwide Acceptance Holdings LLC; NMMB Holdings, Inc. ( NMMB Holdings\u201d); NPH Property Holdings, LLC ( NPH\u201d); Prospect Opportunity Holdings I, Inc. ( POHI\u201d); SB Forging Company, Inc. ( SB Forging\u201d); STI Holding, Inc.; UTP Holdings Group Inc. ( UTP Holdings\u201d); Valley Electric Holdings I, Inc.( Valley Holdings I\u201d); and Valley Electric Holdings II, Inc. ( Valley Holdings II\u201d).\nWe are externally managed by our investment adviser, Prospect Capital Management L.P. ( Prospect Capital Management\u201d or the Investment Adviser\u201d). Prospect Administration LLC ( Prospect Administration\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Investment Adviser, provides administrative services and facilities necessary for us to operate.\nOur investment objective is to generate both current income and long-term capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in senior and subordinated secured debt and equity of private companies in need of capital for acquisitions, divestitures, growth, development, recapitalizations and other purposes. We work with the management teams or financial sponsors to seek investments with historical cash flows, asset collateral or contracted pro-forma cash flows.\nWe currently have four primary strategies that guide our origination of investment opportunities: (1) lending to companies, including companies controlled by private equity sponsors and not controlled by private equity sponsors, and including both directly-originated loans and syndicated loans, (2) lending to companies and purchasing controlling equity positions in such companies, including both operating companies and financial services companies, (3) purchasing controlling equity positions and lending to real estate companies, and (4) investing in structured credit. We may also invest in other strategies and opportunities from time to time that we view as attractive. We continue to evaluate other origination strategies in the ordinary course of business with no specific top-down allocation to any single origination strategy.\nLending to Companies - We make directly-originated agented loans to companies, including companies which are controlled by private equity sponsors and companies that are not controlled by private equity sponsors (such as companies that are controlled by the management team, the founder, a family or public shareholders). This debt can take the form of first lien, second lien, unitranche or unsecured loans. These loans typically have equity subordinate to our loan position. We may also purchase selected equity co-investments in such companies. In addition to directly-originated, agented loans, we also invest in senior and secured loans, syndicated loans and high yield bonds that have been sold to a club or syndicate of buyers, both in the primary and secondary markets. These investments are often purchased with a long term, buy-and-hold outlook, and we often look to provide significant input to the transaction by providing anchoring orders. Historically, this strategy has compromised approximately 40%-60% of our portfolio.\nLending to Companies and Purchasing Controlling Equity Positions in Such Companies - This strategy involves purchasing senior and secured yield-producing debt and controlling equity positions in operating companies across various industries. We believe this strategy provides enhanced certainty of closure to sellers and the opportunity for management to continue on in their current roles. These investments are often structured in tax-efficient partnerships, enhancing returns. Historically, this strategy has comprised approximately 15%-25% of our portfolio.\nPurchasing Controlling Equity Positions and Lending to Real Estate Companies - We purchase debt and controlling equity positions in tax-efficient real estate investment trusts ( REIT\u201d or REITs\u201d). The real estate investments of National Property REIT Corp. ( NPRC\u201d) are in various classes of developed and occupied real estate properties that generate current yields, including multi-family properties, and student housing. NPRC seeks to identify properties that have historically significant occupancy rates and recurring cash flow generation. NPRC generally co-invests with established and experienced property management teams that manage such properties after acquisition. Additionally, NPRC makes investments in rated secured structured notes (primarily debt of structured credit). NPRC also purchases loans originated by certain consumer loan facilitators. It purchases each loan in its entirety (i.e., a whole loan\u201d). The borrowers are consumers, and the loans are typically serviced by the facilitators of the loans. Historically, this overall investment strategy has comprised approximately 10%-20% of our business.\nInvesting in Structured Credit - We make investments in structured credit, often taking a significant position in subordinated structured notes (equity) and rated secured structured notes (debt). The underlying portfolio of each structured credit investment is diversified across approximately 100 to 200 broadly syndicated loans and does not have direct exposure to real estate, mortgages, or consumer-based credit assets. The structured credit portfolios in which we invest are managed by established collateral management teams with many years of experience in the industry. Historically, this overall strategy has comprised approximately 10%-20% of our portfolio.\nWe invest primarily in first and second lien secured loans and unsecured debt, which in some cases includes an equity component. First and second lien secured loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of unsecured debt of a given portfolio company. These loans also have the benefit of security interests on the assets of the portfolio company, which may rank ahead of or be junior to other security interests. Our investments in structured credit are subordinated to senior loans and are generally unsecured. We invest in debt and equity positions of structured credit which are a form of securitization in which the cash flows of a portfolio of loans are pooled and passed on to different classes of owners in various tranches. Our structured credit investments are derived from portfolios of corporate debt securities which are generally risk rated from BB to B.\nWe hold many of our control investments in a two-tier structure consisting of a holding company and one or more related operating companies for tax purposes. These holding companies serve various business purposes including concentration of management teams, optimization of third party borrowing costs, improvement of supplier, customer, and insurance terms, and enhancement of co-investments by the management teams. In these cases, our investment, which is generally equity in the holding company, the holding company's equity investment in the operating company and any debt from us directly to the operating company structure represents our total exposure for the investment. As of June 30, 2021, as shown in our Consolidated Schedule of Investments, the cost basis and fair value of our investments in controlled companies was $2,482,431 and $2,919,717, respectively. This structure gives rise to several of the risks described in our public documents and highlighted elsewhere in this Annual Report. We consolidate all wholly-owned and substantially wholly-owned holding companies formed by us for the purpose of holding our controlled investments in operating companies. There is no significant effect of consolidating these holding companies as they hold minimal assets other than their investments in the controlled operating companies. Investment company accounting prohibits the consolidation of any operating companies.\nOn June 11, 2021, at a special meeting of stockholders, our stockholders authorized us to sell shares of our common stock (during the next 12 months) at a price or prices below our net asset value per share at the time of sale in one or more offerings subject to certain conditions as set forth in the proxy statement relating to the special meeting (including that the number of shares sold on any given date does not exceed 25% of its outstanding common stock immediately prior to such sale).\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nInvestment Transactions\nWe seek to be a long-term investor with our portfolio companies. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, we acquired $163,168 of new investments, completed follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies totaling approximately $126,420, funded $316 of revolver advances, and recorded PIK interest of $16,771, resulting in gross investment originations of $306,675. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, we received full repayments on investments totaling $105,537, received $50,727 in partial prepayments, and revolver paydowns of $8, resulting in net repayments of $156,272.\nDebt Issuances and Redemptions\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2021, we repaid $1,817 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae at par in accordance with the Survivor's Option, as defined in the InterNotes\u00ae Offering prospectus. In order to replace short maturity debt with longer-term debt, we redeemed $241,580 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae at par with a weighted average interest rate of 4.87%. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a loss in the amount of the unamortized debt issuance costs. The net loss on the extinguishment of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae in the three months ended June 30, 2021 was $2,997.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2021, we issued $78,828 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae with a weighted average stated interest rate of 3.50%, to extend our borrowing base. The newly issued notes mature between April 15, 2026 and July 15, 2033 and generated net proceeds of $77,359.\nOn March 16, 2021, we commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash up to $30,000 aggregate principal outstanding amount of the 2022 Notes at the purchase price of $102.00, plus accrued and unpaid interest ( 2022 Notes March 2021 Tender Offer\u201d). On April 13, 2021, $50 aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes, representing 0.05% of the previously outstanding 2022 Notes, were validly tendered and accepted. The 2022 Notes March 2021 Tender Offer resulted in our recognizing a loss of $1.\nOn April 28, 2021, we amended the 2019 Facility and closed an expanded five year revolving credit facility (the 2021 Facility\u201d and collectively with the 2014 Facility, the 2018 Facility and the 2019 Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The lenders had extended commitments of $1,107,500 as of June 30, 2021. The Revolving Credit Facility includes an accordion feature which allows commitments to be increased up to $1,500,000 in the aggregate. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on April 27, 2026. It includes a revolving period that extends through April 27, 2025, followed by an additional one-year amortization period, with distributions allowed to Prospect after the completion of the revolving period. During such one-year amortization period, all principal payments on the pledged assets will be applied to reduce the balance. At the end of the one-year amortization period, the remaining balance will become due, if required by the lenders.\nOn April 7, 2021, we commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash up to $30,000 aggregate principal amount of the 6.375% 2024 Notes at the purchase price of $107.50, plus accrued and unpaid interest ( 6.375% 2024 Notes April 2021 Tender Offer\u201d). On May 4, 2021, $226 aggregate principal amount of the 6.375% 2024 notes, representing 0.28% of the previously outstanding 6.375% 2024 Notes, were validly tendered and accepted. The 6.375% 2024 Notes April 2021 Tender Offer resulted in our recognizing a loss of $18 during the three months ended June 30, 2021.\nOn April 7, 2021, we commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash up to $30,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes at the purchase price of $104.15, plus accrued and unpaid interest ( 2023 Notes April 2021 Tender Offer\u201d). On May 4, 2021, $836 aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes were tendered, representing 0.29% of the previously outstanding 2023 Notes. The 2023 Notes April 2021 Tender Offer resulted in our recognizing a loss of $43 during the three months ended June 30, 2021.\nOn May 27, 2021, we issued $300,000 aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes that mature on November 15, 2026 (the 3.364% 2026 Notes\u201d). The 3.364% 2026 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.364% per year, payable semi-annually on November 15, and May 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2021. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 3.364% 2026 Notes, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, were $293,283. As of June 30, 2021, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 3.364% 2026 Notes is $300,000.\nOn June 15, 2021, we redeemed $70,761 of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes. The transaction resulted in our recognizing a loss of $1,934 during the three months ended June 30, 2021. Following the redemption, none of the 2028 Notes remained outstanding.\nEquity Issuances\nOn April 22, 2021, May 20, 2021, and June 17, 2021, we issued 357,521, 344,487, and 317,011 shares of our common stock in connection with the dividend reinvestment plan, respectively.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2021, we issued 2,508,672 shares of our Series A1 Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $57,182, 187,000 shares of our Series A2 Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $4,208, and 108,897 shares of our Series M1 Preferred Stock for net proceeds of $2,662, each excluding offering costs and preferred stock dividend reinvestments.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2021, we issued 1,000 shares of our Series A1 Preferred Stock and 9 shares of our Series M1 Preferred Stock in connection with the preferred stock dividend reinvestment plan.\nInvestment Holdings\nAt June 30, 2021, we have $6,201,778, or 157.2%, of our net assets invested in 124 long-term portfolio investments and CLOs.\nOur annualized current yield was 11.7% and 11.4% as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively, across all performing interest bearing investments, excluding equity investments and non-accrual loans. Our annualized current yield was 9.2% and 9.7% as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively, across all investments. Monetization of equity positions that we hold and loans on non-accrual status are not included in this yield calculation. In many of our portfolio companies we hold equity positions, ranging from minority interests to majority stakes, which we expect over time to contribute to our investment returns. Some of these equity positions include features such as contractual minimum internal rates of returns, preferred distributions, flip structures and other features expected to generate additional investment returns, as well as contractual protections and preferences over junior equity, in addition to the yield and security offered by our cash flow and collateral debt protections.\nWe are a non-diversified company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. As required by the 1940 Act, we classify our investments by level of control. As defined in the 1940 Act, Control Investments\u201d are those where there is the ability or power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company. Control is generally deemed to exist when a company or individual possesses or has the right to acquire within 60 days or less, a beneficial ownership of 25% or more of the voting securities of an investee company. Under the 1940 Act, Affiliate Investments\u201d are defined by a lesser degree of influence and are deemed to exist through the possession outright or via the right to acquire within 60 days or less, beneficial ownership of 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of another person. Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments\u201d are those that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we own controlling interests in the following portfolio companies: CP Energy Services Inc. ( CP Energy\u201d); Credit Central Loan Company, LLC ( Credit Central\u201d); Echelon Transportation, LLC ( Echelon\u201d); First Tower Finance Company LLC ( First Tower Finance\u201d); Freedom Marine Solutions, LLC ( Freedom Marine\u201d); InterDent, Inc. ( InterDent\u201d); Kickapoo Ranch Pet Resort ( Kickapoo\u201d); MITY, Inc. ( MITY\u201d); NPRC; Nationwide Loan Company LLC ( Nationwide\u201d); NMMB, Inc. ( NMMB\u201d); Pacific World Corporation ( Pacific World\u201d); R-V Industries, Inc. ( R-V\u201d); Universal Turbine Parts, LLC ( UTP\u201d); USES Corp. ( United States Environmental Services\u201d or USES\u201d); and Valley Electric Company, Inc. ( Valley Electric\u201d). In June 2019, CP Energy purchased controlling interest of the common equity of Spartan Energy Holdings, Inc. ( Spartan Holdings\u201d), which owns 100% of Spartan Energy Services, LLC ( Spartan\u201d), a portfolio company of Prospect with $15,656 in senior secured term loans (the Spartan Term Loan A\u201d) due to us as of June 30, 2021. As a result of CP Energy's purchase, and given Prospect's controlling interest in CP Energy, we report our investments in Spartan as control investment. Spartan remains the direct borrow and guarantor to Prospect for the Spartan Term Loan A.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we also own affiliated interests in Nixon, Inc. ( Nixon\u201d), PGX Holdings, Inc. ( PGX\u201d), RGIS Services, LLC ( RGIS\u201d), and Targus Cayman HoldCo Limited ( Targus\u201d).\nThe following shows the composition of our investment portfolio by level of control as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020:\n\nThe following shows the composition of our investment portfolio by type of investment as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020: \n(1)Participating Interest includes our participating equity investments, such as net profits interests, net operating income interests, net revenue interests, and overriding royalty interests.\nThe following shows our investments in interest bearing securities by type of investment as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020:\n\nThe following shows the composition of our investment portfolio by industry as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020: \n(1)Our SSN investments do not have industry concentrations and as such have been separated in the tables above. As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, Structured Finance includes $90,200 and $79,200, respectively, of senior secured debt investments held through our investment in NPRC and its wholly-owned subsidiary.\nPortfolio Investment Activity\nOur origination efforts are focused primarily on secured lending to non-control investments to reduce the risk in the portfolio by investing primarily in first lien loans, though we also continue to close select junior debt and equity investments. For information regarding investment activity for the year ended June 30, 2019, see the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020.\nOur gross investment activity for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 are presented below.\n\n(1)Includes follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies and refinancings, if any.\n(2)Includes partial prepayments of principal, scheduled amortization payments, and refinancings, if any.\n(3)Weighted average interest rates for new investments by portfolio composition is calculated with the current rate at the end of the period. In addition, Revolving Line of Credit and Delayed Draw Term Loans are excluded from the calculation.\nInvestment Valuation\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at such market quotations. In order to validate market quotations, management and the independent valuation firm look at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and nature of the quotations. In determining the range of values for debt instruments where market quotations are not available, except CLOs and debt investments in controlling portfolio companies, management and the independent valuation firm estimated corporate and security credit ratings and identified corresponding yields to maturity for each loan from relevant market data. A discounted cash flow technique was then applied using the appropriate yield to maturity as the discount rate, to determine a range of values. In determining the range of values for debt investments of controlled companies and equity investments, the enterprise value was determined by applying a market approach such as using earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) multiples, net income and/or book value multiples for similar guideline public companies and/or similar recent investment transactions and/or an income approach, such as the discounted cash flow technique. The enterprise value technique may also be used to value debt investments which are credit impaired. For stressed debt and equity investments, asset recovery analysis was used.\nIn determining the range of values for our investments in CLOs, the independent valuation firm uses a discounted multi-path cash flow model. The valuations were accomplished through the analysis of the CLO deal structures to identify the risk exposures from the modeling point of view as well as to determine an appropriate call date (i.e., expected maturity). These risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations, which are simulations used to model the probability of different outcomes, to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows for the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market and certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment. In addition, we generate a single-path cash flow utilizing our best estimate of expected cash receipts, and assess the reasonableness of the implied discount rate that would be effective for the value derived from the corresponding multi-path cash flow model.\nWith respect to our online consumer and SME lending initiative, we invest primarily in marketplace loans through marketplace lending platforms. We do not conduct loan origination activities ourselves. Therefore, our ability to purchase consumer and SME loans, and our ability to grow our portfolio of consumer and SME loans, are directly influenced by the business performance and competitiveness of the marketplace loan origination business of the marketplace lending platforms from which we purchase consumer and SME loans. In addition, our ability to analyze the risk-return profile of consumer and SME loans is significantly dependent on the marketplace platforms' ability to effectively evaluate a borrower's credit profile and likelihood of default. If we are unable to effectively evaluate borrowers' credit profiles or the credit decisioning and scoring models implemented by each platform, we may incur unanticipated losses which could adversely impact our operating results.\nThe Board of Directors looked at several factors in determining where within the range to value the asset including: recent operating and financial trends for the asset, independent ratings obtained from third parties, comparable multiples for recent sales of companies within the industry and discounted cash flow models for our investments in CLOs. The composite of all these various valuation techniques, applied to each investment, was a total valuation of $6,201,778.\nOur portfolio companies are generally lower middle-market companies, outside of the financial sector, with less than $100,000 of annual EBITDA. We believe our investment portfolio has experienced less volatility than others because we believe there are more buy and hold investors who own these less liquid investments.\nImpact of the novel coronavirus (the COVID-19\u201d) pandemic\nAs of June 30, 2021, there remains to be global uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused severe disruptions in the global economy and has negatively impacted the fair value and performance of certain investments since the pandemic began. For the year ended June 30, 2021, the aggregate increases in fair value and net unrealized appreciation on investments were driven by the expansion of comparable company trading multiples and/or tightened credit spreads as the level of market volatility generated by the COVID-19 pandemic declined over the twelve month period. However, for certain investments in our portfolio, the valuations continue to reflect factors such as specific industry concerns, uncertainty about the duration of business shutdowns and near-term liquidity needs. For additional information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business and our operating results, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Risk Factors - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the global economy, which has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our portfolio companies and our business and operations.\u201d\nControl Company Investments\nControl investments offer increased risk and reward over straight debt investments. Operating results and changes in market multiples can result in dramatic changes in values from quarter to quarter. Significant downturns in operations can further result in our looking to recoveries on sales of assets rather than the enterprise value of the investment. Equity positions in our portfolio are susceptible to potentially significant changes in value, both increases as well as decreases, due to changes in operating results and market multiples. Our controlled companies discussed below experienced such changes and we recorded corresponding fluctuations in valuations during the year ended June 30, 2021.\nEchelon Transportation, LLC\nProspect owns 100% of the equity of Echelon, a consolidated holding company. Echelon owns 60.7% of the equity of AerLift. Echelon is an aircraft leasing company.\nThe fair value of our investment in Echelon decreased to $84,240 as of June 30, 2021, which is a discount of $13,904 from its amortized cost, compared to a fair value of $85,627 as of June 30, 2020, representing a discount of $2,581 to its amortized cost basis. The increase in discount to amortized cost resulted from lower aircraft residual values, as well as an increase in Echelon's cost basis.\nFirst Tower Finance Company LLC\nProspect owns 100% of the equity of First Tower Delaware, a consolidated holding company. First Tower Delaware owns 80.1% of First Tower Finance. First Tower Finance owns 100% of First Tower, LLC ( First Tower\u201d), a multiline specialty finance company.\nThe fair value of our investment in First Tower increased to $592,356 as of June 30, 2021, representing a premium of $236,502 to its amortized cost basis compared to a fair value of $508,465 as of June 30, 2020, a premium of $150,250 to its amortized cost. The increase in premium to amortized cost was driven by strong financial performance.\nInterDent, Inc.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2018, Prospect exercised its rights and remedies under its loan documents to exercise the shareholder voting rights in respect of the stock of InterDent and to appoint a new Board of Directors of InterDent, all the members of which are our Investment Adviser's professionals. As a result, Prospect's investment in InterDent is classified as a control investment.\nThe fair value of our investment in InterDent increased to $412,339 as of June 30, 2021, a premium of $129,650 to its amortized cost basis compared to a fair value of $230,757 as of June 30, 2020, a discount of $36,296 to its amortized cost. The increase in premium to amortized cost was driven by strong financial performance and expansion of comparable company trading multiples.\nMITY, Inc.\nProspect owns 100% of the equity of MITY Delaware, a consolidated holding company.

The increase in premium is primarily driven by compression of capitalization rates and, to a lesser extent, growth in net operating income in our real estate portfolio.\nNationwide Loan Company LLC\nProspect owns 100% of the membership interests of Nationwide Acceptance Holdings LLC ( Nationwide Holdings\u201d), a Consolidated Holding Company.

The increase to the premium was driven by strong financial performance and expansion of comparable company trading multiples.\nR-V Industries, Inc.\nProspect owns 88.27% of the fully-diluted equity of R-V Industries, Inc. ( R-V\u201d), with R-V management owning the remaining 11.73% of the equity. On December 15, 2020 we restructured our $28,622 Senior Subordinated Note with R-V into a $28,622 Senior Secured Note.

The decrease in discount to amortized cost resulted from improved financial performance and expansion of comparable company trading multiples.\nValley Electric Company, Inc.\nProspect owns 100% of the common stock of Valley Holdings I, a Consolidated Holding Company.

The increase in premium to amortized cost was driven by an expansion of comparable company trading multiples.\nOur controlled investments, including those discussed above, are valued at $437,286 above their amortized cost as of June 30, 2021.\nAffiliate and Non-Control Company Investments\nWe hold three affiliate investments at June 30, 2021 with a total fair value of $356,734, a premium of $153,791 from their combined amortized cost compared to a fair value of $187,537 as of June 30, 2020, representing a $24,053 premium to its amortized cost. The increase in premium is primarily driven by our investment in PGX Holdings, Inc. ( Progrexion\u201d), which is valued at a premium of $126,933 at June 30, 2021 compared to a premium of $180 as of June 30, 2020. The increase in Progrexion's premium to amortized cost was driven by strong financial performance.\nWith the non-control/non-affiliate investments, generally, there is less volatility related to our total investments because our equity positions tend to be smaller than with our control/affiliate investments, and debt investments are generally not as susceptible to large swings in value as equity investments. For debt investments, the fair value is generally limited on the high side to each loan's par value, plus any prepayment premium that could be imposed. However, as of June 30, 2021, Engine Group, Inc. ( Engine\u201d) and USC, two of our non-control/non-affiliate investments are valued at discounts to amortized cost of $27,258 and $96,794, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, our CLO investment portfolio is valued at a $334,066 discount to amortized cost. Excluding Engine, USC, and the CLO investment portfolio, the fair value of our non-control/non-affiliate investments at June 30, 2021 increased and are valued at $10,695 above their amortized cost, compared to a discount of $35,674 recorded at June 30, 2020. This increase is driven largely by tightening credit spreads as market participants expected a lower yield on similar investments as the level of volatility generated by the COVID-19 pandemic declined over the twelve month period.\nCapitalization\nOur investment activities are capital intensive and the availability and cost of capital is a critical component of our business. We capitalize our business with a combination of debt and equity. Our debt as of June 30, 2021 consists of: a Revolving Credit Facility availing us of the ability to borrow debt subject to borrowing base determinations; Convertible Notes which we issued in April 2017 (with a follow-on issuance in May 2018) and March 2019; Public Notes which we issued in March 2013, October 2018, December 2018 (and from time to time through our 2029 Notes Follow-on Program), January 2021, and May 2021; and Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae which we issue from time to time. As of June 30, 2021, our equity capital is comprised of common and preferred equity.\nThe following table shows our outstanding debt as of June 30, 2021.\n\n(1)As permitted by ASC 825-10-25, we have not elected to value our Revolving Credit Facility, Convertible Notes, Public Notes and Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae at fair value. The fair value of these debt obligations are categorized as Level 2 under ASC 820 as of June 30, 2021.\n(2)The maximum draw amount of the Revolving Credit facility as of June 30, 2021 is $1,107,500.\n(3)Net Carrying Value excludes deferred financing costs associated with the Revolving Credit Facility. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for accounting policy details.\n(4)We use available market quotes to estimate the fair value of the Convertible Notes and Public Notes.\n(5)The fair value of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae is estimated by discounting remaining payments using current Treasury rates plus spread based on observable market inputs.\n(6)Represents the rate on drawn down and outstanding balances. Deferred debt issuance costs are amortized on a straight-line method over the stated life of the obligation.\n(7)The effective interest rate is equal to the effect of the stated interest, the accretion of original issue discount and amortization of debt issuance costs. For the 2029 Notes, the rate presented is a combined effective interest rate of their respective original Note issuances and Note Follow-on Programs.\n(8)For the Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae, the rate presented is the weighted average effective interest rate. Interest expense and deferred debt issuance costs, which are amortized on a straight-line method over the stated life of the obligation which approximates level yield, are weighted against the average year-to-date principal balance.\nThe following table shows the contractual maturities of our Revolving Credit Facility, Convertible Notes, Public Notes and Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae as of June 30, 2021.\n\nThe following table shows the contractual maturities of our Revolving Credit Facility, Convertible Notes, Public Notes and Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae as of June 30, 2020.\n\nWe may from time to time seek to cancel or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The amounts involved may be material. In addition, we may from time to time enter into additional debt facilities, increase the size of existing facilities or issue additional debt securities, including secured debt, unsecured debt and/or debt securities convertible into common stock. Any such purchases or exchanges of outstanding debt would be subject to prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual and regulatory restrictions and other factors.\nHistorically, we have funded a portion of our cash needs through borrowings from banks, issuances of senior securities, including secured, unsecured and convertible debt securities, or issuances of common equity. For flexibility, we maintain a universal shelf registration statement that allows for the public offering and sale of our debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, subscription rights, and warrants and units to purchase such securities up to an indeterminate amount. We may from time to time issue securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement or otherwise pursuant to private offerings. The issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions, funding needs and other factors and there can be no assurance that any such issuance will occur or be successful.\nEach of our Convertible Notes, Public Notes and Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae (collectively, our Unsecured Notes\u201d) are our general, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured indebtedness and will be senior in right of payment to any of our subordinated indebtedness that may be issued in the future. The Unsecured Notes are effectively subordinated to our existing secured indebtedness, such as our credit facility, and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally subordinated to any existing and future liabilities and other indebtedness of any of our subsidiaries.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn August 29, 2014, we renegotiated our previous credit facility and closed an expanded five and a half year revolving credit facility (the 2014 Facility\u201d). The lenders had extended commitments of $885,000 under the 2014 Facility as of June 30, 2018. The 2014 Facility included an accordion feature which allowed commitments to be increased up to $1,500,000 in the aggregate. Interest on borrowings under the 2014 Facility was one-month LIBOR plus 225 basis points. Additionally, the lenders charged a fee on the unused portion of the 2014 Facility equal to either 50 basis points if at least 35% of the credit facility was drawn or 100 basis points otherwise.\nOn August 1, 2018, we renegotiated the 2014 Facility and closed an expanded five and a half year revolving credit facility (the 2018 Facility\u201d).

The 2019 Facility included an accordion feature which allowed commitments to be increased up to $1,500,000 in the aggregate.\nOn April 28, 2021, we amended the 2019 Facility and closed an expanded five year revolving credit facility (the 2021 Facility\u201d and collectively with the 2014 Facility, the 2018 Facility and the 2019 Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The lenders had extended commitments of $1,107,500 as of June 30, 2021. The Revolving Credit Facility includes an accordion feature which allows commitments to be increased up to $1,500,000 in the aggregate. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on April 27, 2026. It includes a revolving period that extends through April 27, 2025, followed by an additional one-year amortization period, with distributions allowed to Prospect after the completion of the revolving period. During such one-year amortization period, all principal payments on the pledged assets will be applied to reduce the balance. At the end of the one-year amortization period, the remaining balance will become due, if required by the lenders.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains restrictions pertaining to the geographic and industry concentrations of funded loans, maximum size of funded loans, interest rate payment frequency of funded loans, maturity dates of funded loans and minimum equity requirements. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain requirements relating to portfolio performance, including required minimum portfolio yield and limitations on delinquencies and charge-offs, violation of which could result in the early termination of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility also requires the maintenance of a minimum liquidity requirement. As of June 30, 2021, we were in compliance with the applicable covenants.\nInterest on borrowings under the 2021 Facility is one-month LIBOR plus 205 basis points. Additionally, the lenders charge a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility equal to either 40 basis points if more than 60% of the credit facility is drawn, or 70 basis points if more than 35% and an amount less than or equal to 60% of the credit facility is drawn, or 150 basis points if an amount less than or equal to 35% of the credit facility is drawn. The 2021 Facility requires us to pledge assets as collateral in order to borrow under the credit facility.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2021, June 30, 2020, and June 30, 2019, the average stated interest rate (i.e., rate in effect plus the spread) and average outstanding borrowings for the Revolving Credit Facility were as follows:\n\nAs of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, we had $640,853 and $545,496, respectively, available to us for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility, net of $356,937 and $237,536 outstanding borrowings as of the respective balance sheet dates. As of June 30, 2021, the investments, including cash and cash equivalents, used as collateral for the Revolving Credit Facility had an aggregate fair value of $1,807,442, which represents 28.8% of our total investments, including cash and cash equivalents. These assets are held and owned by PCF, a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, and, as such, these investments are not available to our general creditors. As additional eligible investments are transferred to PCF and pledged under the Revolving Credit Facility, PCF will generate additional availability up to the current commitment amount of $1,107,500. The release of any assets from PCF requires the approval of the facility agent.\nIn connection with the origination and amendments of the Revolving Credit Facility, we incurred $15,299 of fees and $7,509 were carried over from the previous facilities, all of which are being amortized over the term of the facility in accordance with ASC 470-50. As of June 30, 2021, $11,141 remains to be amortized and is reflected as deferred financing costs on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nDuring the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded $18,208, $21,850 and $23,097, respectively, of interest costs, unused fees and amortization of financing costs on the Revolving Credit Facility as interest expense.\nConvertible Notes\nOn April 11, 2014, we issued $400,000 aggregate principal amount of convertible notes that mature on April 15, 2020 (the 2020 Notes\u201d), unless previously converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. The 2020 Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.75% per year, payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 each year, beginning October 15, 2014. Total proceeds from the issuance of the 2020 Notes, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs, were $387,500. On January 30, 2015, we repurchased $8,000 aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes at a price of 93.0, including commissions.

During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased an additional $13,500 aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes at a price of 99.5, including commissions.

On May 10, 2019, the Original Selling Agent Agreement was terminated, and we entered into a new selling agent agreement with InspereX LLC (the May 2019 Selling Agent Agreement\u201d), authorizing the issuance and sale from time to time of up to $1,000,000 of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae.\nOn September 16, 2019, the May 2019 Selling Agent Agreement was terminated, and we entered into a new selling agent agreement with InspereX LLC (the September 2019 Selling Agent Agreement\u201d), authorizing the issuance and sale from time to time of up to $500,000 of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae. We sold approximately $1,700,000 in aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae under the Original Selling Agent Agreement, May 2019 Selling Agent Agreement, and September 2019 Selling Agent Agreement (collectively the Previous Selling Agent Agreements\u201d).\nOn February 13, 2020, the September 2019 Selling Agent Agreement was terminated, and we entered into a new selling agent agreement with InspereX LLC (the Selling Agent Agreement\u201d), authorizing the issuance and sale from time to time of up to $1,000,000 of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae (collectively with the previously authorized selling agent agreements, the InterNotes\u00ae Offerings\u201d). Additional agents may be appointed by us from time to time in connection with the InterNotes\u00ae Offering and become parties to the Selling Agent Agreement. We have, from time to time, repurchased certain notes issued through the InterNotes\u00ae Offerings and, therefore, as of June 30, 2021, $508,711 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae were outstanding.\nThese notes are direct unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding. Each series of notes will be issued by a separate trust. These notes bear interest at fixed interest rates and offer a variety of maturities no less than twelve months from the original date of issuance.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2021, we issued $188,390 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae for net proceeds of $185,189. These notes were issued with stated interest rates ranging from 1.50% to 6.00% with a weighted average interest rate of 4.20%. These notes will mature between January 15, 2024 and July 15, 2033. The following table summarizes the Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae issued during the year ended June 30, 2021.\n\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, we issued $233,988 aggregate principal amount of our Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae for net proceeds of $230,117. The following table summarizes the Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae issued during the year ended June 30, 2020.\n\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2021, we redeemed, prior to maturity, $354,069 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae at par with a weighted average interest rate of 5.06% in order to replace shorter maturity debt with longer-term debt. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we repaid $5,839 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae at par in accordance with the Survivor's Option of the InterNotes\u00ae. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a loss in the amount of the unamortized debt issuance costs. The net loss on the extinguishment of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae in the year ended June 30, 2021 was $2,997. The following table summarizes the Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae outstanding as of June 30, 2021.\n\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2020, we redeemed, prior to maturity, $255,822 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae at par with a weighted average interest rate of 5.06% in order to replace shorter maturity debt with longer-term debt. During the year ended June 30, 2020, we repaid $5,636 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae at par in accordance with the Survivor's Option of the InterNotes\u00ae. As a result of these transactions, we recorded a loss in the amount of the unamortized debt issuance costs. The net loss on the extinguishment of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae in the year ended June 30, 2020 was $2,470.\nThe following table summarizes the Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae outstanding as of June 30, 2020.\n\nIn connection with the issuance of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae, we incurred $28,275 of fees which are being amortized over the term of the notes, of which $10,496 remains to be amortized and is included as a reduction within Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of June 30, 2021.\nDuring the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we recorded $38,852, $37,563 and $41,711, respectively, of interest costs and amortization of financing costs on the Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae as interest expense.\nNet Asset Value\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2021, our net asset value increased by $889,656. After reducing our net asset value by the stated value of our cumulative preferred stock issuances, our net asset value available to common stockholders increased by $752,616, or $1.63 per common share. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net realized and net change in unrealized gains of $678,070, or $1.77 per basic weighted average common share. During the year ended June 30, 2021, net investment income of $285,737, or $0.75 per basic weighted average common share, also exceeded distributions to common and preferred stockholders of $277,856 (including distributions classified as return of capital distributions to common stockholders), or $0.72 per basic weighted average common share, resulting in a net increase of $0.03 per basic weighted average common share. The increase was primarily offset by $0.11 of dilution per common share related to common stock issuances through our common stock dividend reinvestment program and by $0.04 of dilution per common share related to preferred stock issuances for the year ended June 30, 2021. The following table shows the calculation of net asset value per common share as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020.\n\nResults of Operations\nFor information regarding results of operations for the year ended June 30, 2019, see the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020.\nOperating results for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n\nWhile we seek to maximize gains and minimize losses, our investments in portfolio companies can expose our capital to risks greater than those we may anticipate. These companies typically do not issue securities rated investment grade, and have limited resources, limited operating history, and concentrated product lines or customers. These are generally private companies with limited operating information available and are likely to depend on a small core of management talents. Changes in any of these factors can have a significant impact on the value of the portfolio company. These changes, along with those discussed in Investment Valuation above, can cause significant fluctuations in our net change in unrealized gains (losses) from investments, and therefore our net increase (decrease) in nets assets resulting from operations attributable to common stockholders, quarter over quarter.\nInvestment Income\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities that we own, dividend income on any common or preferred stock that we own, and fees generated from the structuring of new deals. Our investments, if in the form of debt securities, will typically have a term of one to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. To the extent achievable, we will seek to collateralize our investments by obtaining security interests in our portfolio companies' assets. We also may acquire minority or majority equity interests in our portfolio companies, which may pay cash or in-kind dividends on a recurring or otherwise negotiated basis. In addition, we may generate revenue in other forms including prepayment penalties and possibly consulting fees. Any such fees generated in connection with our investments are recognized as earned.\nInvestment income consists of interest income, including accretion of loan origination fees and prepayment penalty fees, dividend income and other income, including settlement of net profits interests, overriding royalty interests and structuring fees.\nThe following table describes the various components of investment income and the related levels of debt investments:\n\n(1) Excludes equity investments and non-accrual loans.\n(2) Excludes equity investments.\nThe average interest earned on interest bearing performing assets decreased from 10.55% for the year ended June 30, 2020 to 10.15% for the year ended June 30, 2021. The decrease is primarily driven by a decrease in interest income due to a decline in LIBOR, as well as originations at lower rates than our average existing portfolio yield, offset by early repayments causing an increase in accelerated income. The average interest earned on all interest bearing assets increased from 9.43% for the year ended June 30, 2020 to 9.56% for the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase is primarily due to decreases in non-accrual loans.\nInvestment income is also generated from dividends and other income which is less predictable than interest income. The following table describes dividend income earned for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively:\n\nOther income is comprised of structuring fees, advisory fees, royalty interests, settlement of net profits interests and settlement of residual profits interests. The following table describes other income earned for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively:\n\nOperating Expenses\nOur primary operating expenses consist of investment advisory fees (base management and income incentive fees), borrowing costs, legal and professional fees, overhead-related expenses and other operating expenses. These expenses include our allocable portion of overhead under the Administration Agreement with Prospect Administration under which Prospect Administration provides administrative services and facilities for us. Our investment advisory fees compensate the Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions.\nThe following table describes the various components of our operating expenses:\n\nTotal gross and net base management fee was $114,622 and $108,910 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in total gross base management fee is directly related to an increase in average total assets.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we incurred $71,227 and $68,057 of income incentive fees, respectively. This increase was driven by a corresponding increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income, to $356,964 from $333,751 for the years ended June 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively. No capital gains incentive fee has yet been incurred pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. Income incentive fee for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 includes a $264 and $1,306 adjustment for fees earned in prior periods that were neither expensed nor paid to the Investment Adviser.\nDuring the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we incurred $130,618 and $148,368, respectively, of interest and credit facility expenses related to our Revolving Credit Facility, Convertible Notes, Public Notes and Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae (collectively, our Notes\u201d). These expenses are related directly to the leveraging capacity put into place for each of those periods and the levels of indebtedness actually undertaken in those periods.\nThe table below describes the various expenses of our Notes and the related indicators of leveraging capacity and indebtedness during these years.\n\n(1)Includes only the stated interest expense.\n(2)Includes the stated interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, accretion of discount on Public Notes and commitment fees on the undrawn portion of our Revolving Credit Facility.\nInterest expense decreased from $148,368 year ended June 30, 2020 to $130,618 for the year ended June 30, 2021. The weighted average stated interest rate on borrowings (excluding amortization, accretion and undrawn facility fees) decreased from 5.47% for the year ended June 30, 2020 to 4.94% for the year ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to repurchases and early retirements of our Convertible Notes and the issuance of the 2026 Notes and 3.364% 2026 Notes at lower rates.\nThe allocation of net overhead expense from Prospect Administration was $14,262 and $18,247 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Prospect Administration received estimated payments of $1,572 and $1,530 directly from our portfolio companies and certain funds managed by the Investment Adviser for legal services during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, we were given a credit in the amount of $3,522 for legal expenses incurred on behalf of our portfolio companies that were remitted to Prospect Administration during the year ended June 30, 2021. We were given a credit for these payments as a reduction of the administrative services cost payable by us to Prospect Administration. Had Prospect Administration not received these payments, Prospect Administration's charges for its administrative services would have increased by this amount.\nTotal operating expenses, excluding investment advisory fees, interest and credit facility expenses, and allocation of overhead from Prospect Administration ( Other Operating Expenses\u201d), net of any expense reimbursements, were $15,501 and $14,254 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of $1,247 during the year ended June 30, 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses offset by a decrease in legal fees due to a reimbursement from litigation proceeds of previously expensed legal fees.\nNet Realized Gains (Losses)\nThe following table details net realized gains (losses) from investments for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020:\n\nNet Realized Losses from Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, we recorded a net realized loss from the extinguishment of debt of $23,511 and $2,702, respectively. Refer to Capitalization for additional discussion.\nChange in Unrealized Gains (Losses)\nThe following table details net change in unrealized gains (losses) for our portfolio for the for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020:\n\n(1) For the year ended June 30, 2020, the fair value of our investments was negatively impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information, see Investment Valuation\u201d.\nThe following table reflects net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments for the year ended June 30, 2021:\n\nThe following table reflects net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments for year ended June 30, 2020:\n\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOn July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA\u201d) announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR rates after 2021 (the FCA Announcement\u201d). Furthermore, in the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board ( ARRC\u201d) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. On August 24, 2017, the Federal Reserve Board requested public comment on a proposal by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in cooperation with the Office of Financial Research, to produce three new reference rates intended to serve as alternatives to LIBOR. These alternative rates are based on overnight repurchase agreement transactions secured by U.S. Treasury Securities. On December 12, 2017, following consideration of public comments, the Federal Reserve Board concluded that the public would benefit if the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published the three proposed reference rates as alternatives to LIBOR (the Federal Reserve Board Notice\u201d). In April 2018, the Federal Reserve System, in conjunction with the ARRC, announced the replacement of LIBOR with a new index, calculated by short term repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ( SOFR\u201d). On June 12, 2019, the Staff from the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance, Division of Investment Management, Division of Trading and Markets, and Office of the Chief Accountant issued a statement about the potentially significant effects on financial markets and market participants when LIBOR is discontinued in 2021 and no longer available as a reference benchmark rate. The Staff encouraged all market participants to identify contracts that reference LIBOR and begin transitions to alternative rates. Although SOFR appears to be the preferred replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR, at this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United States, United Kingdom or elsewhere or, whether the COVID-19 will have further effect on LIBOR transition plans. The elimination of LIBOR or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations.\nAt this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of the FCA Announcement or other regulatory changes or announcements, any establishment of any alternative reference rates, including SOFR and its market acceptance, or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our net investment income cannot yet be determined. The CLOs in which the Company is invested generally contemplate a scenario where LIBOR is no longer available by requiring the CLO administrator to calculate a replacement rate primarily through dealer polling on the applicable measurement date. However, there is uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of the dealer polling processes, including the willingness of banks to provide such quotations, which could adversely impact our net investment income. Recently, the CLOs we are invested in have included, or have been amended to include, language permitting the CLO investment manager to implement a market replacement rate (like SOFR) upon the occurrence of certain material disruption events. However, we cannot ensure that all CLOs in which we are invested will have such provisions, nor can we ensure the CLO investment managers will undertake the suggested amendments when able. In addition, the effect of a phase out of LIBOR on U.S. senior secured loans, the underlying assets of the CLOs in which we invest, is currently unclear. To the extent that any replacement rate utilized for senior secured loans differs from that utilized for a CLO that holds those loans, the CLO would experience an interest rate mismatch between its assets and liabilities which could have an adverse impact on the Company's net investment income and portfolio returns.\nFor the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, our operating activities provided $31,019 and $429,438 of cash, respectively. There were no investing activities for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Financing activities used $11,970 and $491,975 of cash during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which included dividend payments of $195,574 and $239,954, respectively.\nOur primary uses of funds have been to continue to invest in portfolio companies, through both debt and equity investments, repay outstanding borrowings and to make cash distributions to our stockholders.\nOur primary sources of funds have historically been issuances of debt and equity. More recently, we have and may continue to fund a portion of our cash needs through repayments and opportunistic sales of our existing investment portfolio. We may also securitize a portion of our investments in unsecured or senior secured loans or other assets. Our objective is to put in place such borrowings in order to enable us to expand our portfolio. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we borrowed $1,092,861 and we made repayments totaling $973,460 under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2021, our outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility was $356,937. As of June 30, 2021, we had, net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, $263,100 outstanding on the Convertible Notes, $1,114,717 outstanding on the Public Notes, and $498,215 outstanding on the Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae (See Capitalization\u201d above).\nUndrawn committed revolvers and delayed draw term loans to our portfolio companies incur commitment and unused fees ranging from 0.00% to 5.00%. As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, we had $67,385 and $41,487, respectively, of undrawn revolver and delayed draw term loan commitments to our portfolio companies. The fair value of our undrawn committed revolvers and delayed draw term loans was zero as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020.\nWe have guaranteed $2,737 in standby letters of credit issued through a financial intermediary and $2,775 of equipment lease obligations on behalf of InterDent, Inc. ( InterDent\u201d) as of June 30, 2021. Under these arrangements, we would be required to make payments to the financial intermediary or equipment lease provider, respectively, if InterDent was to default on their related payment obligations. As of June 30, 2021, we have not recorded a liability on the statement of assets and liabilities for these guarantees as the likelihood of default on the standby letters of credit or equipment lease is deemed to be remote.\nOn February 13, 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-236415) that was effective upon filing pursuant to Rule 462(e) under the Securities Act as permitted under the Small Business Credit Availability Act. The registration statement permits us to issue, through one or more transactions, an indeterminate amount of securities, consisting of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, subscription rights to purchase our securities, warrants representing rights to purchase our securities or separately tradeable units combining two or more of our securities.\nPreferred Stock\nOn August 3, 2020, we entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement with Preferred Capital Securities, LLC ( PCS\u201d), pursuant to which PCS has agreed to serve as the Company's agent, principal distributor and dealer manager for the Company's offering of up to 40,000,000 shares, par value $0.001 per share, of preferred stock, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. Such preferred stock will initially be issued in multiple series, including the Series A1 Preferred Stock, the Series M1 Preferred Stock, and the Series M2 Preferred Stock. In connection with such offering, on August 3, 2020, we filed Articles Supplementary with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, reclassifying and designating 120,000,000 shares of the Company's authorized and unissued shares of common stock into shares of preferred stock as Convertible Preferred Stock.\u201d On October 30, 2020, we entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement with InspereX LLC, pursuant to which InspereX LLC has agreed to serve as the Company's agent and dealer manager for the Company's offering of up to 10,000,000 shares, par value $0.001 per share, of 5.50% Series AA1 Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. In connection with such offering, on October 30, 2020, we filed Articles Supplementary with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, reclassifying and designating an additional 20,000,000 shares of the Company's authorized and unissued shares of common stock into shares of preferred stock as Convertible Preferred Stock. On May 19, 2021, we entered into an Underwriting Agreement with UBS Securities LLC, relating to the offer and sale of 187,000 shares, par value $0.001 per share, of 5.50% Series A2 Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. The issuance of the Series A2 Preferred Stock settled on May 26, 2021. In connection with such offering, on May 19, 2021, we filed Articles Supplementary with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of Maryland, reclassifying and designating an additional 1,000,000 shares of the Company's authorized and unissued shares of common stock into shares of preferred stock as Convertible Preferred Stock.\nIn connection with the offerings of the 5.50% Preferred Stock, we adopted and amended, respectively, a preferred stock dividend reinvestment plan (the Preferred Stock Plan\u201d or the Preferred Stock DRIP\u201d), pursuant to which holders of the 5.50% Preferred Stock will have dividends on their 5.50% Preferred Stock automatically reinvested in additional shares of such 5.50% Preferred Stock at a price per share of $25.00, if they elect.\nEach series of 5.50% Preferred Stock ranks (with respect to the payment of dividends and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) (a) senior to our common stock, (b) on parity with each other series of our preferred stock, and (c) junior to our existing and future secured and unsecured indebtedness. See Note 8, Fair Value and Maturity of Debt Outstanding for further discussion on our senior securities.\nAt any time prior to the listing of the 5.50% Preferred Stock on a national securities exchange, shares of the 5.50% Preferred Stock are convertible, at the option of the holder of the 5.50% Preferred Stock (the Holder Optional Conversion\u201d). We will settle any Holder Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the Settlement Amount (as defined below) that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average price of shares of our common stock over each of the five consecutive trading days ending on the Holder Conversion Exercise Date (as defined in the applicable prospectus supplement)(such arithmetic average, the 5-day VWAP\u201d). For the Series A1 Preferred Stock, the Series AA1 Preferred Stock, and the Series A2 Preferred Stock, Settlement Amount\u201d means (A) $25.00 per share (the Stated Value\u201d), plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the Holder Conversion Exercise Date, minus (C) the Holder Optional Conversion Fee (as described in the prospectus supplements relating to the Series A1 Preferred Stock, the Series AA1 Preferred Stock, or the Series A2 Preferred\nStock, as applicable) applicable on the respective Holder Conversion Deadline (as defined in the applicable prospectus supplement). For the Series M Preferred Stock, Settlement Amount\u201d means (A) the Stated Value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the Holder Conversion Exercise Date, minus (C) the applicable Series M Clawback, if any (as described in the prospectus supplements relating to the Series M Preferred Stock. Series M Clawback,\u201d if applicable, means an amount equal to the aggregate amount of all dividends, whether paid or accrued, on such share of Series M Stock in the three full months prior to the Holder Conversion Exercise Date. Subject to certain limited exceptions, we will not pay any portion of the Settlement Amount in cash (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock) until the five year anniversary of the date on which a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock has been issued. Beginning on the five year anniversary of the date on which a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock is issued, we may elect to settle all or a portion of any Holder Optional Conversion in cash without limitation or restriction. The right of holders to convert a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock will terminate upon the listing of such share on a national securities exchange.\nSubject to certain limited exceptions allowing earlier redemption, beginning on the earlier of the five year anniversary of the date on which a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock has been issued, or, for listed shares of 5.50% Preferred Stock, five years from the earliest date on which any series that has been listed was first issued (the earlier of such dates, the Redemption Eligibility Date\u201d), such share of 5.50% Preferred Stock may be redeemed at any time or from time to time at our option (the Issuer Optional Redemption\u201d), at a redemption price of 100% of the Stated Value of the shares of 5.50% Preferred Stock to be redeemed plus unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption.\nSubject to certain limitations, each share of 5.50% Preferred Stock may be converted at our option (the Issuer Optional Conversion\u201d). We will settle any Issuer Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount (as defined below) that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the IOC Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the 5-day VWAP, subject to our ability to obtain or maintain any stockholder approval that may be required under the 1940 Act to permit us to sell our common stock below net asset value if the 5-day VWAP represents a discount to our net asset value per share of common stock. For the 5.50% Preferred Stock, IOC Settlement Amount\u201d means (A) the Stated Value, plus (B) unpaid dividends accrued to, but not including, the date fixed for conversion. Subject to certain limited exceptions, we will not exercise an Issuer Optional Conversion with respect to a share of 5.50% Preferred Stock until after the date set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement with respect to the 5.50% Preferred Stock. In connection with an Issuer Optional Conversion, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or maintain any stockholder approval that may be required under the 1940 Act to permit us to sell our common stock below net asset value. If we do not have or obtain any required stockholder approval under the 1940 Act to sell our common stock below net asset value and the 5-day VWAP is at a discount to our net asset value per share of common stock, we will settle any conversions in connection with an Issuer Optional Conversion by paying or delivering, as the case may be, (A) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash and (B) a number of shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to (1) (a) the IOC Settlement Amount, minus (b) any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount that we elect to pay in cash, divided by (2) the NAV per share of common stock at the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the date of conversion. We will not pay any portion of the IOC Settlement Amount from an Issuer Optional Conversion in cash (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock) until the Redemption Eligibility Date. Beginning on the Redemption Eligibility Date, we may elect to settle any Issuer Optional Conversion in cash without limitation or restriction. In the event that we exercise an Issuer Optional Conversion with respect to any shares of 5.50% Preferred Stock, the holder of such 5.50% Preferred Stock may instead elect a Holder Optional Conversion with respect to such 5.50% Preferred Stock provided that the date of conversion for such Holder Optional Conversion would occur prior to the date of conversion for an Issuer Optional Conversion.\nWe determined the estimated value as of June 30, 2021 of our 5.50% Preferred Stock, with a $25.00 stated value per share. We engaged a third-party valuation service to assist in our determination based on the calculation resulting from the total equity on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 (the Form 10-K\u201d), which was prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, adjusted for the fair value of our investments (i.e. from our Consolidated Schedule of Investments) and total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of our 5.50% Preferred Stock outstanding. Based on this methodology and because the result from the calculation above is greater than the $25.00 per share stated value of our Preferred Stock, the estimated value of our Preferred Stock as of June 30, 2021 is $25.00 per share.\nCommon Stock\nOur common stockholders' equity accounts as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 reflect cumulative shares issued, net of shares repurchased, as of those respective dates. Our common stock has been issued through public offerings, a registered direct offering, the exercise of over-allotment options on the part of the underwriters, our dividend reinvestment plan and in connection with the acquisition of certain controlled portfolio companies. When our common stock is issued, the related\noffering expenses have been charged against paid-in capital in excess of par. All underwriting fees and offering expenses were borne by us.\nWe did not repurchase any shares of our common stock for the years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of June 30, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet liabilities or other contractual obligations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, other than those which originate from 1) the investment advisory and management agreement and the administration agreement and 2) the portfolio companies.\nRecent Developments\nOn July 12, 2021, we entered into an underwriting agreement by and among us, Prospect Capital Management L.P., Prospect Administration LLC, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets, LLC and UBS Securities LLC, as representatives of the underwriters, relating to the offer and sale of 6,000,000 shares, or $150,000 in aggregate liquidation preference, of our 5.35% Series A Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the 5.35% Preferred Stock\u201d), at a public offering price of $25.00 per share. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 shares of 5.35% Preferred Stock solely to cover over-allotments. The offering closed on July 19, 2021.\nOn July 21, 2021, we funded total commitments of $202,931, comprised of a $49,000 first lien senior secured floating rate term loan and a $153,931 second lien senior secured floating rate term loan, to support the refinancing of PGX Holdings, Inc., a portfolio company of H.I.G. Capital, LLC and market leading provider of consumer credit repair services in the U.S. In connection with the refinancing, our $47,773 first lien senior secured term loan, $18,164 1.5 lien senior secured term loan and $122,271 second lien senior secured term loan outstanding with PGX Holdings, Inc. were fully repaid at par.\nDuring the period of July 14, 2021 through August 13, 2021, we provided notice to call certain of our Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae at par with the following terms:\n\nOn August 19, 2021, we increased total commitments to our Revolving Credit Facility by $50,000 to $1,157,500 in the aggregate.\nDuring the period from July 1, 2021 through August 24, 2021, we issued $61,137 aggregate principal amount of Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae for net proceeds of $59,648, with $9,170 of such aggregate principal amount scheduled to settle on August 26, 2021.\nOn August 24, 2021, we announced the declaration of monthly dividends for our 5.50% Preferred Stock for holders of record on the following dates based on an annual rate equal to 5.50% of the Stated Value of $25.00 per share as set forth in the Articles Supplementary for the 5.50% Preferred Stock, from the date of issuance or, if later from the most recent dividend payment date, as follows:\n\nOn August 24, 2021, we announced the declaration of quarterly dividends for our 5.35% Preferred Stock for holders of record on the following dates based on an annual rate equal to 5.35% of the Stated Value of $25.00 per share as set forth in the Articles Supplementary for the 5.35% Preferred Stock, from the date of issuance or, if later from the most recent dividend payment date, as follows:\n\nOn August 24, 2021, we announced the declaration of monthly dividends on our common stock as follows:\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K, ASC 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies ( ASC 946\u201d), and Articles 3, 6 and 12 of Regulation S-X. Under the 1940 Act, ASC 946, and the regulations pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company or an operating company which provides substantially all of its services to benefit us. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Prospect, PCF, PSBL, PYC, and the Consolidated Holding Companies. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial results of our non-substantially wholly-owned holding companies and operating portfolio company investments are not consolidated in the financial statements. Any operating companies owned by the Consolidated Holding Companies are not consolidated.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made in the presentation of prior consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to conform to the presentation as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income, expenses, and gains and losses during the reported period. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, creditworthiness of the issuers of our investment portfolio and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ, and these differences could be material.\nInvestment Classification\nWe are a non-diversified company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. As required by the 1940 Act, we classify our investments by level of control. As defined in the 1940 Act, Control Investments\u201d are those where there is the ability or power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company. Control is generally deemed to exist when a company or individual possesses or has the right to acquire within 60 days or less, a beneficial ownership of more than 25% of the voting securities of an investee company. Under the 1940 Act, Affiliate Investments\u201d are defined by a lesser degree of influence and are deemed to exist through the possession outright or via the right to acquire within 60 days or less, beneficial ownership of 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of another person. Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments\u201d are those that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.\nAs a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets\u201d specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, our qualifying assets as a percentage of total assets, stood at 76.31% and 74.44%, respectively.\nInvestment Transactions\nInvestments are recognized when we assume an obligation to acquire a financial instrument and assume the risks for gains or losses related to that instrument. Specifically, we record all security transactions on a trade date basis. Investments are derecognized when we assume an obligation to sell a financial instrument and forego the risks for gains or losses related to that instrument. Amounts for investments traded but not yet settled are reported in Due to Broker or Due from Broker, in the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.\nForeign Currency\nForeign currency amounts are translated into US Dollars (USD) on the following basis:\ni.fair value of investment securities, other assets and liabilities-at the spot exchange rate on the last business day of the period; and\nii.purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses-at the rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such investment transactions, income or expenses.\nWe do not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations arising from changes in fair values of investments held or disposed of during the period. Such fluctuations are included within the net realized and net change in unrealized gains or losses from investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInvestment Risks\nOur investments are subject to a variety of risks. Those risks include the following:\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the fair value of the financial instrument.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk represents the risk that we would incur if the counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their agreements with us.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk represents the possibility that we may not be able to rapidly adjust the size of our investment positions in times of high volatility and financial stress at a reasonable price.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk represents a change in interest rates, which could result in an adverse change in the fair value of an interest-bearing financial instrument.\nPrepayment Risk\nMany of our debt investments allow for prepayment of principal without penalty. Downward changes in interest rates may cause prepayments to occur at a faster than expected rate, thereby effectively shortening the maturity of the security and making us less likely to fully earn all of the expected income of that security and reinvesting in a lower yielding instrument.\nStructured Credit Related Risk\nCLO investments may be riskier and less transparent to us than direct investments in underlying companies. CLOs typically will have no significant assets other than their underlying senior secured loans. Therefore, payments on CLO investments are and will be payable solely from the cash flows from such senior secured loans.\nOnline Small-and-Medium-Sized Business Lending Risk\nWith respect to our online small-and-medium-sized business ( SME\u201d) lending initiative, we invest primarily in marketplace loans through marketplace lending platforms (e.g. OnDeck). We do not conduct loan origination activities\nourselves. Therefore, our ability to purchase SME loans, and our ability to grow our portfolio of SME loans, is directly influenced by the business performance and competitiveness of the marketplace loan origination business of the marketplace lending platforms from which we purchase SME loans. In addition, our ability to analyze the risk-return profile of SME loans is significantly dependent on the marketplace platforms' ability to effectively evaluate a borrower's credit profile and likelihood of default. If we are unable to effectively evaluate borrowers' credit profiles or the credit decisioning and scoring models implemented by each platform, we may incur unanticipated losses which could adversely impact our operating results.\nForeign Currency\nInvestments denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency transactions may involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with those of domestic origin. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities.\nInvestment Valuation\nAs a BDC, and in accordance with the 1940 Act, we fair value our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis, with any unrealized gains and losses reflected in net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. To value our investments, we follow the guidance of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement ( ASC 820\u201d), that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in conformity with GAAP, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. In accordance with ASC 820, the fair value of our investments is defined as the price that we would receive upon selling an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market in which that investment is transacted.\nASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nIn all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment.\nOur Board of Directors has established procedures for the valuation of our investment portfolio. These procedures are detailed below.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations.\nFor most of our investments, market quotations are not available. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, our Board of Directors has approved a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below.\n1.Each portfolio company or investment is reviewed by our investment professionals with independent valuation firms engaged by our Board of Directors.\n2.The independent valuation firms prepare independent valuations for each investment based on their own independent assessments and issue their report.\n3.The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and discusses with the independent valuation firms the valuation reports, and then makes a recommendation to the Board of Directors of the value for each investment.\n4.The Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser, the respective independent valuation firm and the Audit Committee.\nOur non-CLO investments are valued utilizing a yield technique, enterprise value ( EV\u201d) technique, net asset value technique, asset recovery technique, discounted cash flow technique, or a combination of techniques, as appropriate. The yield technique uses loan spreads for loans and other relevant information implied by market data involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Under the EV technique, the EV of a portfolio company is first determined and allocated over the portfolio company's securities in order of their preference relative to one another (i.e., waterfall\u201d allocation). To determine the EV, we typically use a market (multiples) valuation approach that considers relevant and applicable market trading data of guideline public companies, transaction metrics from precedent merger and acquisitions transactions, and/or a discounted cash flow technique. The net asset value technique, an income approach, is used to derive a value of an underlying investment (such as real estate property) by dividing a relevant earnings stream by an appropriate capitalization rate. For this purpose, we consider capitalization rates for similar properties as may be obtained from guideline public companies and/or relevant transactions. The asset recovery technique is intended to approximate the net recovery value of an investment based on, among other things, assumptions regarding liquidation proceeds based on a hypothetical liquidation of a portfolio company's assets. The discounted cash flow technique converts future cash flows or earnings to a range of fair values from which a single estimate may be derived utilizing an appropriate discount rate. The fair value measurement is based on the net present value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts.\nIn applying these methodologies, additional factors that we consider in valuing our investments may include, as we deem relevant: security covenants, call protection provisions, and information rights; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company's ability to make payments; the principal markets in which the portfolio company does business; publicly available financial ratios of peer companies; the principal market; and enterprise values, among other factors.\nOur investments in CLOs are classified as Level 3 fair value measured securities under ASC 820 and are valued using a discounted multi-path cash flow model. The CLO structures are analyzed to identify the risk exposures and to determine an appropriate call date (i.e., expected maturity). These risk factors are sensitized in the multi-path cash flow model using Monte Carlo simulations, which is a simulation used to model the probability of different outcomes, to generate probability-weighted (i.e., multi-path) cash flows from the underlying assets and liabilities. These cash flows are discounted using appropriate market discount rates, and relevant data in the CLO market as well as certain benchmark credit indices are considered, to determine the value of each CLO investment. In addition, we generate a single-path cash flow utilizing our best estimate of expected cash receipts, and assess the reasonableness of the implied discount rate that would be effective for the value derived from the multi-path cash flows. We are not responsible for and have no influence over the asset management of the portfolios underlying the CLO investments we hold, as those portfolios are managed by non-affiliated third-party CLO collateral managers. The main risk factors are default risk, prepayment risk, interest rate risk, downgrade risk, and credit spread risk.\nValuation of Other Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nASC 825, Financial Instruments, specifically ASC 825-10-25, permits an entity to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value (the Fair Value Option\u201d). We have not elected the Fair Value Option to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities. See Note 8 in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for the disclosure of the fair value of our outstanding debt and the market observable inputs used in determining fair value.\nConvertible Notes\nWe have recorded the Convertible Notes at their contractual amounts. We have determined that the embedded conversion options in the Convertible Unsecured Notes are not required to be separately accounted for as a derivative under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. See Note 5 in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nRevenue Recognition\nRealized gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated using the specific identification method.\nInterest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis. Original issue discounts and market discounts are capitalized and accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans using the effective interest method or straight-line, as applicable, and adjusted only for material amendments or prepayments. Upon a prepayment of a loan, prepayment premiums, original issue discount, or market discounts are recorded as interest income.\nLoans are placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. Unpaid accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans are either applied to the cost basis or interest income, depending upon management's judgment of the collectibility of the loan receivable. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and in\nmanagement's judgment, is likely to remain current and future principal and interest collections when due are probable. Interest received and applied against cost while a loan is on non-accrual, and PIK interest capitalized but not recognized while on non-accrual, is recognized prospectively on the effective yield basis through maturity of the loan when placed back on accrual status, to the extent deemed collectible by management. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 0.6% of our total assets at fair value are in non-accrual status.\nSome of our loans and other investments may have contractual payment-in-kind ( PIK\u201d) interest or dividends. PIK income computed at the contractual rate is accrued into income and reflected as receivable up to the capitalization date. PIK investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities. When additional securities are received, they typically have the same terms, including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued. On these payment dates, we capitalize the accrued interest (reflecting such amounts in the basis as additional securities received). PIK generally becomes due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. At the point that we believe PIK is not fully expected to be realized, the PIK investment will be placed on non-accrual status. When a PIK investment is placed on non-accrual status, the accrued, uncapitalized interest or dividends are reversed from the related receivable through interest or dividend income, respectively. We do not reverse previously capitalized PIK interest or dividends. Upon capitalization, PIK is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments. PIK investments on non-accrual status are restored to accrual status if we believe that PIK is expected to be realized.\nInterest income from investments in Subordinated Structured Notes (typically preferred shares, income notes or subordinated notes of CLO funds) and equity\u201d class of security of securitized trust is recorded based upon an estimation of an effective yield to expected maturity utilizing assumed cash flows in accordance with ASC 325-40, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. We monitor the expected cash inflows from our CLO and securitized trust equity investments, including the expected residual payments, and the effective yield is determined and updated periodically.\nDividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.\nOther income generally includes amendment fees, commitment fees, administrative agent fees and structuring fees which are recorded when earned. Excess deal deposits, net profits interests and overriding royalty interests are included in other income. See Note 10 in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nFederal and State Income Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC and intend to continue to comply with the requirements of the Code applicable to RICs. We are required to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income and intend to distribute (or retain through a deemed distribution) all of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain to stockholders; therefore, we have made no provision for income taxes. The character of income and gains that we will distribute is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from GAAP. Book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified to paid-in capital.\nIf we do not distribute (or are not deemed to have distributed) at least 98% of our annual ordinary income and 98.2% of our capital gains in the calendar year earned, we will generally be required to pay an excise tax equal to 4% of the amount by which 98% of our annual ordinary income and 98.2% of our capital gains exceed the distributions from such taxable income for the year. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income, we accrue excise taxes, if any, on estimated excess taxable income. As of June 30, 2021, we do not expect to have any excise tax due for the 2021 calendar year. Thus, we have not accrued any excise tax for this period.\nIf we fail to satisfy the annual distribution requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would we be required to make distributions. Distributions would generally be taxable to our individual and other non-corporate taxable stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the reduced maximum rate applicable to qualified dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, provided certain holding period and other requirements are met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributions would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. To qualify again to be taxed as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to distribute to our stockholders our accumulated earnings and profits attributable to non-RIC years. In addition, if we failed to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, then, in order to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to elect to recognize and pay tax on any net built-in gain (the excess of aggregate gain, including items of income, over aggregate loss that would have been realized if we had been liquidated) or, alternatively, be subject to taxation on such built-in gain recognized for a period of five years.\nWe follow ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. As of June 30, 2021, we did not record any unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities. Management's determinations regarding ASC 740 may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon factors including, but not limited to, an on-going analysis of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. Although we file both federal and state income tax returns, our major tax jurisdiction is federal. Our federal tax returns for the tax years ended August 31, 2018 and thereafter remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.\nDividends and Distributions\nDividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount, if any, to be paid as a monthly dividend or distribution is approved by our Board of Directors quarterly and is generally based upon our management's estimate of our future taxable earnings. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually.\nOur distributions may exceed our earnings, and therefore, portions of the distributions that we make may be a return of the money originally invested and represent a return of capital distribution to shareholders for tax purposes.\nFinancing Costs\nWe record origination expenses related to our Revolving Credit Facility and the Unsecured Notes as deferred financing costs. These expenses are deferred and amortized as part of interest expense using the straight-line method over the stated life of the obligation for our Revolving Credit Facility and for our Prospect Capital InterNotes\u00ae. The effective interest method is used to amortize deferred financing costs for our remaining Unsecured Notes over the respective expected life or maturity. In the event that we modify or extinguish our debt before maturity, we follow the guidance in ASC 470-50, Modification and Extinguishments ( ASC 470-50\u201d). For modifications to or exchanges of our Revolving Credit Facility, any unamortized deferred costs relating to lenders who are not part of the new lending group are expensed. For extinguishments of our Unsecured Notes, any unamortized deferred costs are deducted from the carrying amount of the debt in determining the gain or loss from the extinguishment.\nUnamortized deferred financing costs are presented as a direct deduction to the respective Unsecured Notes (see Notes 5, 6, and 7 in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion).\nWe may record registration expenses related to shelf filings as prepaid expenses. These expenses consist principally of SEC registration fees, legal fees and accounting fees incurred. These prepaid expenses are charged to capital upon the receipt of proceeds from an equity offering or charged to expense if no offering is completed. As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, there are no prepaid expenses related to registration expenses and all amounts incurred have been expensed.\nGuarantees and Indemnification Agreements\nWe follow ASC 460, Guarantees ( ASC 460\u201d). ASC 460 elaborates on the disclosure requirements of a guarantor in its interim and annual consolidated financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also requires a guarantor to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, for those guarantees that are covered by ASC 460, the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing certain guarantees.\nPer Share Information\nIn accordance with ASC 946, senior equity securities, such as preferred stock, are not considered in the calculation of net asset value per share. Net asset value per share also excludes the effects of assumed conversion of outstanding convertible securities, regardless of whether their conversion would have a diluting effect. Therefore, our net asset value is presented on the basis of per common share outstanding as of the applicable period end.\nWe compute earnings per common share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260\u201d). Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing the net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share reflects the assumed conversion of dilutive securities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOn July 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which amends the financial instruments impairment guidance so that an entity is required to measure expected credit losses for financial assets based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As such, an entity will use forward-looking information to estimate credit losses. ASU 2016-13 also amends the guidance in FASB ASC Subtopic No. 325-40, Investments-Other, Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets, related to the subsequent measurement of accretable yield recognized as interest income over the life of a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets under the effective yield method. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures as our investments are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.\nOn July 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The standard modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding certain disclosures. The adoption of ASU 2018-13 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn May 2020, the SEC adopted rule amendments that will impact the requirement of investment companies, including BDCs, to disclose the financial statements of certain of their portfolio companies or certain acquired funds (the Final Rules\u201d). The Final Rules adopted a new definition of significant subsidiary\u201d set forth in Rule 1-02(w)(2) of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act. Rules 3-09 and 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X require investment companies to include separate financial statements or summary financial information, respectively, in such investment company's periodic reports for any portfolio company that meets the definition of significant subsidiary.\u201d The Final Rules adopt a new definition of significant subsidiary\u201d applicable only to investment companies that (i) modifies the investment test and the income test, and (ii) eliminates the asset test currently in the definition of significant subsidiary\u201d in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X. The new Rule 1-02(w)(2) of Regulation S-X is intended to more accurately capture these portfolio companies that are more likely to materially impact the financial condition of an investment company. The Final Rules became effective on January 1, 2021, but voluntary compliance was permitted in advance of the effective date. We evaluated the impact of adopting the Final Rules on our consolidated financial statements and because the new definition of significant subsidiary\u201d contained therein is specific to investment companies, we elected to early adopt the Final Rules beginning with our fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. Refer to Note 3. in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of significant subsidiary results and disclosures.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The standard is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the optional guidance on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. The Company did not utilize the optional expedients and exceptions provided by ASU 2020-04 during the year ended June 30, 2021.\nIn August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity, which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing the separation models for (1) convertible debt with a cash conversion feature and (2) convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature. As a result, after adoption, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. Additionally, ASU 2020-06 requires the application of the if-converted method to calculate the impact of convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.", "item_7_tables": "Table 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Corporation provides an in-depth look into the company's financial performance and position. It serves as a crucial section complementing the financial statements and should be read along with them. This MD&A section also includes forward-looking statements subject to various uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ significantly from predicted outcomes.\n\nProspect Capital is a financial services company that gives loans and invests mainly in middle-market private firms. It is organized in Maryland as a closed-end investment company and has elected to be treated as a Business Development Company (BDC) and a Regulated Investment Company (RIC) under relevant Acts and Tax Codes. Prospect Capital Management L.P. manages the company, and Prospect Administration LLC provides requisite administrative services.\n\nThe company's primary strategies are to lend to companies, acquire controlling equity positions in these companies, and invest in structured credit and real estate firms. Investment activities largely focus on secured lending through various instruments such as first lien, second lien, and unitranche loans, among others. The company holds many investments in a two-tier company structure for tax optimization.\n\nProspect's investments in Controlled Companies are valued above their amortized cost as of June 30, 2021. For Affiliate and Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments, most have fair values above cost, although a few like Engine Group, Inc., and USC, show discounts to amortized cost, and CLO investments report a discount as well. The company does not consolidate results from non-wholly-owned subsidiaries unless necessary to reflect its investment strategy accurately.\n\nFor financing, Prospect has a variety of strategies, including a Revolving Credit Facility, Convertible Notes, Public Notes, and InterNotes\u00ae. As a RIC, Prospect tries to distribute its investment company taxable income and net capital gain to shareholders and made no provision for income taxes due to this practice.\n\nSeveral risks affect Prospect's investments, including market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, structured credit risk, and foreign currency risk. The company follows procedures for valuing investments, mainly where no active market quotations are available, employing various valuation techniques influenced by factors like market multiples, cash flows, and overall economic conditions.\n\nIn terms of operations, the company generates income from interest on debt securities, dividends on equity securities, and fees related to structuring and managing its investments. Its operating expenses are mainly composed of investment advisory fees, borrowing costs, professional fees, and general administration costs. Prospect reported a net increase in net assets resulting from operations attributable to common shareholders of $963,807 for the year ended June 30, 2021, compared to a net decrease of $16,224 for the year ended June 30, 2020.\n\nThe company's preferred stock offerings and dividend reinvestment plans are discussed, as well as the regulatory changes due to LIBOR transitioning out by 2021. The MD&A ends by considering recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on the company's financial statements and disclosures."}
