These decreases were tempered by a comparative bump from our December 2017 (fiscal 2018) acquired Zappa Stewart superabsorbents business, and organic sales growth in our primarily North American focused pulling and detection and cable materials product lines. Price increases continued during the current year to address elevated raw material costs, but came short of obtaining full margin recovery for the period.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company made further strides on its consolidation and rationalization initiative. We made substantial progress on relocating our pulling and detection product line production operations from our Granite Falls, NC facility to our Hickory, NC facility. The Company has been successful in not incurring elevated levels of manufacturing spend during pulling and detection's period of transition, which is anticipated to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2020. Operational efficiency gains were made in the latter half of the year at our Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC facilities, which absorbed the specialized cable material manufacturing operations of our Pawtucket, RI facility at the start of fiscal 2019. Following the move out of Pawtucket, higher manufacturing expenses were required to maintain service levels during the transition; these expenses were seen in the first half of fiscal 2019 but subsided in the second half of the year, and the Company is now beginning to recognize the long-term cost savings initially sought by combining the operations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities exceeded the prior year and, along with cash repatriated from our U.K. operations, was utilized to pay off in full the outstanding principal balance of our $150,000,000 revolving credit facility. The Company had borrowed $65,000,000 from the facility in December 2017 to substantially fund the acquisition of Zappa Stewart, and had begun paying down the balance in fiscal 2018. Our revolving credit facility allows for us to pay down debt when we have excess cash, while retaining access to immediate liquidity to fund future accretive activities as identified.\nRevenue from the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment increased over the prior year with our specialty chemical intermediates product line sales up over the prior year, with four additional months of operations of our acquired Zappa Stewart business in the current year. The segment's overall revenue increase was negatively impacted by decreased annual sales of our electronic and industrial coatings product line, which saw declines in the second half of the year on exposure to slower Asian markets, which were not fully offset by gains the product line experienced in North America.\nOur Industrial Tapes segment had a slight decrease in sales from the prior year, most notably related to the substantive divestiture of our structural composites product line in the third quarter of the prior year. Our electronic materials product line also contributed to the year-over-year decrease, as it faced headwinds selling into Asian end markets. Positively affecting the segment's top-line results for the year were our pulling and detection, cable materials and specialty products product lines, all with strong sales into North American markets.\nOur Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment's revenue declined from the prior year, primarily on decreased demand for our U.K. and U.S.-produced pipeline coatings products and our bridge and highway products. The overall decrease in sales experienced by the segment was tempered by increased sales of our building envelope and coating and lining systems products.\nThrough mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, our marketing and product development efforts and our ability to rationalize and consolidate our operations, the Company remains focused on its core strategies for sustainable long-term growth. At August 31, 2019, the Company's cash on hand was $47,771,000 and there was no balance outstanding on the Company's $150,000,000 revolving debt facility.\nThe Company has three reportable operating segments summarized below:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProduct Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nManufacturing Focus and Products\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdhesives, Sealants and Additives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nElectronic and Industrial Coatings\nSpecialty Chemical Intermediates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProtective coatings, including moisture protective coatings and customized sealant and adhesive systems for electronics; polyurethane dispersions, polymeric microspheres and superabsorbent polymers.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIndustrial Tapes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCable Materials\nSpecialty Products\nPulling and Detection\nElectronic Materials\nStructural Composites (1)\nFiber Optic Cable Components (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProtective tape and coating products and services, including insulating and conducting materials for wire and cable manufacturers; laminated durable papers, packaging and industrial laminate products and custom manufacturing services; pulling and detection tapes used in the installation, measurement and location of fiber optic cables and water and natural gas lines; cover tapes essential to delivering semiconductor components via tape and reel packaging; composite materials elements (now divested); glass-based strength elements designed to allow fiber optic cables to withstand mechanical and environmental strain and stress (now divested).\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCorrosion Protection and Waterproofing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCoating and Lining Systems\nPipeline Coatings\nBuilding Envelope\nBridge and Highway\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProtective coatings and tape products, including coating and lining systems for use in liquid storage and containment applications; protective coatings for pipeline and general construction applications; adhesives and sealants used in architectural and building envelope waterproofing applications; high-performance polymeric asphalt additives and expansion and control joint systems for use in the transportation and architectural markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 30: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProduct line was substantially divested with the sale of the structural composites rod business on April 20, 2018.

2019 decreased $2,837,000 or 1% to $281,351,000 from $284,188,000 in the prior year.\nRevenue in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment increased $3,106,000 or 3% to $104,796,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $101,690,000 in fiscal 2018. The increase in revenue from our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from our specialty chemical intermediates product line totaling $7,083,000, which included the first full year of operations from the December 2017 acquired Zappa Stewart business. The segment's net sales increase was negatively affected by our electronic and industrial coatings product line's $3,977,000 sales-volume-driven decrease, with headwinds seen most acutely in Asian markets in the second half of the fiscal year. These headwinds also manifested in a decreased royalty received from our licensed manufacturer in Asia.\nRevenue in our Industrial Tapes segment decreased $753,000 or 1% to $129,845,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $130,598,000 in fiscal 2018. The decrease in revenue from our Industrial Tapes segment in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to: (a) a sales volume decrease of $5,077,000 from our structural composite products (following the Company's divestiture of the structural composites rod business in April 2018, product sales revenue for wind energy products significantly declined, and the Company has recognized wind-energy-related revenue, including royalty revenue and revenue for transitional custom manufacturing services performed for the buyer, in our specialty products product line since the sale); and (b) an entirely volume-driven sales decrease of $2,608,000 in our electronic materials product line, which has a near exclusively Asian end-market. These decreases were partially offset by: (a) a sales increase of $3,500,000 from our pulling and detection products, from volume and price-driven sales growth into large scale utility and telecommunications infrastructure build in North America; (b) an increase in revenue from our cable materials products of $2,880,000 on both volume and price; and (c) a sales volume increase of $552,000 for our specialty products, which, subsequent to the sale of our fiber optic cable components business in April 2017 and our structural composites rod business in April 2018, includes revenue from the manufacturing services provided by the Company to the common purchaser of the divested businesses (totaling $2,062,000 for fiscal 2019).\nRevenue from our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment decreased $5,190,000 or 10% to $46,710,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $51,900,000 for fiscal 2018. The decreased revenue for our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in sales totaling $4,680,000 in our pipeline coatings products. Our U.K.-produced water and wastewater pipeline products experienced the sharpest decline attributed to tight credit markets in the Middle East regions they sell into, while our U.S.-produced oil and gas pipeline products had sales levels only slightly below the prior year. Our bridge and highway products failed to repeat the large eastern U.S. bridge work laden prior year sales levels in the current year and were off by $2,353,000 year-over-year. Partially countering the overall decrease in revenue for the segment were: (a) a $952,000 increase in our building envelope product sales, driven predominantly by an increase in sales volume; and (b) coating and lining systems products, which had a revenue increase of $891,000.\nRoyalties and commissions in the Adhesive, Sealants and Additives and Industrial Tapes segments totaled $4,512,000, $5,226,000 and $4,683,000 for the years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in royalties and commissions in fiscal 2019 compared to both fiscal 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to decreased sales of electronic and industrial coatings products by our licensed manufacturer in Asia.\nExport sales from domestic operations to unaffiliated third parties were $30,582,000, $42,883,000 and $36,719,000 for the years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in export sales in fiscal 2019 against fiscal 2018 resulted from decreased export sales into China and Europe. Prior to its divestiture in the fiscal year 2018, nearly all sales related to our structural composite materials product line were into Europe. The increase in export sales in fiscal 2018 against fiscal 2017 resulted from increased export sales into China and Europe.\nIn fiscal 2018, total revenue increased $31,628,000 or 13% to $284,188,000 from $252,560,000 in the prior year. Revenue in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment increased $22,757,000 or 29% to $101,690,000 for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $78,933,000 in fiscal 2017. The increase in revenue from our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to: (a) increases in revenue from our specialty chemical intermediates product line totaling $17,383,000, which included sales of $16,324,000 related to the first eight months of operations from the acquired Zappa Stewart business; and (b) sales increases of $5,374,000 for our electronic and industrial coatings product line reflecting mainly sales volume increases, with some positive growth related to price, from the automotive, industrial controls and appliance manufacturing industries, along with increased sales from the Resin Designs business acquired in early fiscal 2017, and with an increased royalty received from our licensed manufacturer in Asia. Revenue in our Industrial Tapes segment increased $6,575,000 or 5% to $130,598,000 for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $124,023,000 in fiscal 2017. The increase in revenue from our Industrial Tapes segment in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to: (a) sales increases of $6,510,000, predominantly on volume, from our pulling and detection products, with large scale infrastructure build and repair work from the utility and telecommunications industries fueling growth; (b) sales volume increases of $3,902,000 for our specialty products, which, subsequent to the sale of our fiber optic cable components business in April 2017 and our structural composites rod business in April 2018, includes revenue from the manufacturing services provided by the Company to the common purchaser of the divested businesses (totaling $2,186,000 for fiscal 2018); (c) sales volume increases of $1,998,000 from our structural composite products on sales into the wind energy market (following the Company's divestiture of the structural composites rod business in April 2018, the Company began recognizing wind energy-related revenue, including royalty revenue and revenue for transitional custom manufacturing services performed for the buyer, in our specialty products product line); and (d) an entirely volume-driven sales increase of $472,000 in our electronic materials product line. These increases were negatively impacted by: (a) decreased sales of $4,340,000 from our fiber optic cable components product line, which the Company sold in April 2017 (no revenue was recorded within the fiber optic cable components product line following its divestiture early in the third quarter of 2017, including all of fiscal 2018); and (b) a net decrease in revenue from our cable materials products of $1,967,000, with decreases in sales volume more than offsetting pricing increases obtained. Revenue from our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment increased $2,296,000 or 5% to $51,900,000 for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $49,604,000 for fiscal 2017. The increased revenue for our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in sales volume and prices totaling $2,853,000 in our pipeline coatings products, with both our U.K.-produced water and wastewater pipeline products and U.S.-produced oil and gas pipeline products achieving increases over the prior year. Our bridge and highway products achieved a year-over-year increase in sales totaling $145,000, on both volume and price, compared to fiscal 2017, with large bridge infrastructure work in the eastern U.S. continuing in fiscal 2018. Partially countering the overall increase in revenue for the segment in fiscal 2018 were: (a) a $629,000 decrease in our building envelope product sales, driven predominantly by a decrease in sales volume; and (b) coating and lining systems products, which had a net revenue decrease of $73,000 on decreased sales volume offsetting increased sales prices.\nCost of Products and Services Sold\nCost of products and services sold increased $5,027,000 or 3% to $180,163,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $175,136,000 in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold increased to 64% in fiscal 2019 compared to 62% for fiscal 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the relative percentages of cost of products and services sold to revenue for our three operating segments:\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Years Ended August 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of products and services sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdhesives, Sealants and Additives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIndustrial Tapes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCorrosion Protection and Waterproofing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of products and services sold in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment was $60,345,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $53,324,000 in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment increased to 58% for fiscal 2019 compared to 52% in fiscal 2018. Cost of products and services sold in our Industrial Tapes segment was $93,299,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $92,418,000 in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment increased to 72% in fiscal 2019 compared to 71% for fiscal 2018. Cost of products and services sold in our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment was $26,519,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $29,394,000 in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment was consistent at 57% in both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services overall increased primarily due to: (a) a less favorable sales mix, most specifically felt in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment, as our lower margin products constituted a comparatively higher portion of total sales; (b) increasing supply and demand imbalances and tariffs causing rising raw material costs; and (c) production inefficiencies and additional costs to maintain service levels in the first half of fiscal 2019 at our Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC locations following the consolidation of our Pawtucket, RI operations. We purchase a wide variety of commodity items, including petroleum-based solvents, films, yarns, polymers and nonwovens, along with base metals (aluminum and copper), as well as many other substrates. To facilitate control of our margins, we closely monitor the pricing of our commodities-based raw materials across all product lines, as their price volatility can have short- and long-term effects on both our customers' demand for our products and the margins at which we are able to sell them.\nCost of products and services sold in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment was $53,324,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $37,190,000 in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment increased to 52% for fiscal 2018 compared to 47% in fiscal 2017. Cost of products and services sold in our Industrial Tapes segment was $92,418,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $81,919,000 in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment increased to 71% for fiscal 2018 compared to 66% in fiscal 2017. Cost of products and services sold in our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment was $29,394,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $26,927,000 in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment increased to 57% in fiscal 2018 compared to 54% for fiscal 2017. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in the three segments increased primarily due to: (a) the effects of international and domestic trade policy on raw material costs, which most acutely rose in the latter half of fiscal 2018; (b) the rising costs of petroleum-based inputs; (c) an unfavorable product mix, most prominently in our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment, as our lower margin products constituted a comparatively higher portion of total sales in fiscal year 2018; and (d) in the case of our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment the inclusion of $1,070,000 in cost of sale of inventory step-up, related to inventory purchased as part of our fiscal 2018 second quarter acquisition of Zappa Stewart.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $1,085,000 or 2% to $52,728,000 during fiscal 2019 compared to $51,643,000 in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 19% of total revenue in fiscal 2019 compared to 18% for fiscal 2018. The year-over-year increase in expenses is primarily attributable to: (a) increased amortization expense of $638,000, primarily related to intangible assets acquired in our December 31, 2017 acquisition of Zappa Stewart; (b) increased selling and commission expense of $252,000, principally related to sales growth on our highest commissionable products in the current year, coupled with the addition of a full year of the established sales force of Zappa Stewart; and (c) increased research and development costs of $81,000, after the addition of the established research and development department within Zappa Stewart during the second quarter of the prior year. The Company continues to closely monitor spend with an emphasis on controlling costs and leveraging existing resources.\nDuring fiscal 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4,972,000 or 11% to $51,643,000 compared to $46,671,000 in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses stayed consistent at 18% of total revenue in both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. The year-over-year increase in expenses is primarily attributable to: (a) increased amortization expense of $2,680,000, primarily related to intangible assets acquired in our December 31, 2017 acquisition of Zappa Stewart, and a full twelve months of amortization related to our September 30, 2016 acquisition of certain assets of Resin Designs; (b) increased selling and commission expense of $773,000, principally related to sales growth on our highest commissionable products in fiscal year 2018, coupled with the addition of the established sales force of Zappa Stewart and a full twelve months of the established sales force of Resin Designs; and (c) increased research and development expense of $244,000, principally related to fiscal year 2018 addition of the established research and development department of Zappa Stewart and a full twelve months of operation of the established research and development department of Resin Designs.\nLoss on Impairment of Goodwill\nDuring the three-month period ended February 28, 2019 (the second fiscal quarter of 2019), the ordering patterns of our polyurethane dispersions reporting unit's customers, especially those in the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in the reporting unit's backlog of customer orders believed to be firm as of February 28, 2019, indicated that an impairment in the carrying value of the reporting unit might have occurred. As such, we performed an impairment test on our indefinite-lived and long-lived assets related to our polyurethane dispersions reporting unit, now part of the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives operating segment (part of the former Industrial Materials segment during the second fiscal quarter of 2019), in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d and ASC Topic 360, Disclosure - Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\u201d As a result of impairment testing, which included first testing long-lived assets other than goodwill for impairment under applicable guidance, the Company recorded a charge of $2,410,000 to loss on impairment of goodwill within the consolidated statement of operations during the quarter ended February 28, 2019.\nOperations Optimization Costs\nDuring the second half of fiscal 2019, Chase began moving the pulling and detection operations housed in its Granite Falls, NC location to its Hickory, NC facility. This is in line with the Company's ongoing initiative to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its processes. Currently, the pulling and detection operations are the only Chase-owned production operations in Granite Falls, NC, with the remaining portions of the building being either utilized for research and development or leased to a third party. The process of moving has continued subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and is anticipated to be completed during the first half of fiscal 2020. The Company recognized $526,000 in expense related to the move in fiscal 2019. Future costs related to this move are currently anticipated to be approximately $700,000, and the Company plans to disclose these amounts separately on the Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, Chase commissioned engineering studies of certain legacy operations, machinery and locations related to the Company's ongoing facility rationalization and consolidation initiative. Chase is currently reviewing the data and recommendations provided by the study and may further utilize third party engineering, IT and other professional services firms in the future for similar optimization-related work. The Company recognized $200,000 in expense related to these services in fiscal 2019; but given the ongoing nature of the review, an estimate of future costs cannot currently be determined.\nOn June 25, 2018, the Company announced to its employees the planned closing of its Pawtucket, RI manufacturing facility effective August 31, 2018. This was in line with the Company's ongoing efforts to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its processes. The manufacture of products previously produced in the Pawtucket, RI facility was substantially moved to existing Company facilities in Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC during a two-month transition period, with certain additional expenditures recognized in the first fiscal quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, $1,272,000 was expensed related to the closure, including: (a) cash-related employee-related, logistics and uncapitalized facilities improvement costs of $590,000; and (b) non-cash-related accelerated depreciation expense of $682,000. The Company expensed $260,000 in the three-month period ended November 30, 2018 related to the move, with no additional expense recognized in fiscal 2019. Future costs related to this move are not anticipated to be significant to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized $70,000 and $935,000, respectively, in expenses to raze its Randolph, MA facility, which had been idle regarding production for several years. No expense related to this project was recognized in fiscal 2018 or 2019. The Company began marketing the site for sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The Company substantially completed the demolition of the structure in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, and completed other environmental aspects of the project during fiscal 2017. The sale of the property is anticipated to follow in a subsequent period, and any future expenses related to the project are not anticipated to be material.\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nIn fiscal 2018, the Company incurred $393,000 of costs related to our acquisition of Zappa Stewart. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and all related professional service fees (including banking, legal, accounting and actuarial fees) were expensed as incurred within the second fiscal quarter of 2018.\nIn fiscal 2017, the Company incurred $584,000 of costs related to our acquisition of certain assets of Resin Designs. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and all related professional service fees (including banking, legal, accounting, and actuarial fees) were expensed as incurred during the year ended August 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $653,000 or 56% to $519,000 in fiscal 2019 compared to $1,172,000 in fiscal 2018. Interest expense increased $333,000 or 40% to $1,172,000 in fiscal 2018 compared to $839,000 in fiscal 2017. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2019 is the result of the decreased average outstanding balance of Chase's revolving debt facility, following the $65,000,000 draw on the facility in December 2017 to substantially fund the Company's acquisition of Zappa Stewart and subsequent incremental principal payments made.\nIn fiscal 2018, subsequent to the December 2017 borrowing, the Company made $40,000,000 in payments against the principal. In fiscal 2019, Chase made an additional $25,000,000 in principal payments, paying off the outstanding balance in full as of August 31, 2019.\nGain on Sale of Real Estate\nIn November 2016, the Company finalized the sale of its Paterson, NJ property for proceeds of $1,382,000. This transaction resulted in a gain of $792,000 which was recorded during the year ended August 31, 2017.\nIn October 2016, Chase entered an agreement to sell its former corporate headquarters and executive offices in Bridgewater, MA. In December 2016, the sale was finalized for gross proceeds of $740,000, resulting in a gain on sale of $68,000 recognized during the year ended August 31, 2017.\nGain on Sale of License\nIn November 2017, the Company entered an agreement with an unrelated party to sell a license, including certain intellectual property, and sell certain construction in process assets, both related to the manufacturing of certain structural composite materials. In the second fiscal quarter of 2018, the transaction was finalized for gross consideration of $1,111,000 comprising cash proceeds of $1,000,000 and foreign tax consideration paid by the purchaser on Chase's behalf of $111,000. This transaction resulted in a gain of $1,085,000, which was recorded as a gain on sale of license during the fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2018.\nIn relation to this license agreement, the purchaser also entered into a royalty agreement with the Company. The purchaser will make royalty payments to Chase based on the volume of future sales of certain structural composite material manufactured by the purchaser. Revenue recognized related to this royalty agreement was not material in fiscal 2019 or 2018, and this royalty agreement was terminated in fiscal 2019.\nGain on Sale of Businesses\nOn April 20, 2018, Chase finalized an agreement with an unrelated party to sell all inventory, operational machinery and equipment and intangible assets of the Company's structural composites rod business, as well as a license related to the production and sale of rod, for proceeds of $2,232,000, net of transaction costs and following certain working capital adjustments. This business, which was part of the structural composites product line within the Industrial Tapes segment, had limited growth and profitability prospects as part of the Company, and was outside the areas Chase has identified for strategic emphasis. The resulting pre-tax gain on sale of $1,480,000 was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as a gain on sale of businesses within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Chase received $2,075,000, net of transaction costs, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, with the remaining $157,000 received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as a result of a working capital true-up. Chase will provide certain transitional manufacturing and administrative support to the purchaser for which the Company will receive additional consideration upon the performance of services.\nIn relation to this transaction, the purchaser entered into a royalty agreement with the Company. The purchaser will make royalty payments to Chase based on future sales of certain structural composite material manufactured by the purchaser. Royalty revenue recognized in 2019 and 2018 related to this agreement was not material.\nOn April 3, 2017, Chase executed an agreement with an unrelated party to sell all inventory, machinery and equipment and intangible assets of its fiber optic cable components product line for proceeds of $3,858,000, net of transaction costs and following all working capital adjustments. The fiber optic cable components product line had been a part of our Industrial Tapes segment. Given its low-growth and low-margin prospects, and a customer, supplier and equipment base separate from our other businesses, the product line was determined to not be part of Chase's long-term strategy. The resulting pre-tax gain on sale of $2,013,000 was recognized during the year ended August 31, 2017. Further, the purchaser entered a multiyear lease for a portion of the manufacturing space at the Company's Granite Falls, NC facility. Chase will provide certain transitional manufacturing and administrative support to the purchaser for which the Company will receive additional consideration upon the performance of services.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther expense was $992,000 in fiscal 2019 compared to other expense of $172,000 in fiscal 2018, an increase of $820,000. Other income (expense) primarily includes foreign exchange gains (losses) caused by changes in exchange rates on transactions or balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, non-service cost components of periodic pension expense (including pension-related settlement costs due to the timing of lump-sum distributions), interest income, rental income and other non-trade/non-royalty/non-commission receipts. The increase in total other expense in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was largely due to the recognition of $511,000 in pension-related settlement costs in fiscal 2019, while no such expense was recognized in fiscal 2018.\nOther expense was $172,000 in fiscal 2018 compared to other expense of $341,000 in fiscal 2017, a decrease of $169,000. The decrease in total other expense in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was largely due to the lower non-service cost component of periodic pension expense recognized in fiscal 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 24.9% as compared to 24.3% and 31.0% in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe current and prior years' effective tax rates were most prominently affected by the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) in December 2017 and discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognized in relation to the Company's early adoption of ASU 2016-09 and described in more detail below. For fiscal 2019, the Company utilized the new 21% Federal tax rate enacted by the Tax Act. During fiscal 2018, Chase utilized a blended rate of 25.7%, based on a combination of four months of operations under the old 35% corporate income tax rate, and eight months at the new 21% rate. During fiscal 2017, Chase utilized the old 35% corporate income tax rate for the entire period. Please see Note 7 - Income Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the effects of the Tax Act.\nThe Company early adopted ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d, during the first fiscal quarter of 2017. During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $157,000, $1,921,000 and $1,917,000, respectively, within income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The current year decrease in the benefit resulted from a decrease in certain stock option exercise activity in fiscal 2019. The Company anticipates the potential for increased periodic volatility in future effective tax rates based on the continued application of ASU No. 2016-09.\nNet Income\nNet income in fiscal 2019 decreased $10,432,000 or 24% to $32,711,000 compared to $43,143,000 in fiscal 2018. The decrease in net income in 2019 was primarily due to: (a) a lower gross profit on sales; (b) a loss on impairment of goodwill; (c) increased amortization expense recognized in the current period and related to our December 2017 acquisition of Zappa Stewart; (d) nonrecurring gains on sales of both a business and a license in the prior year period; and (e) increased pension-related settlement costs due to the timing of lump-sum disbursements in the current year-to-date period.\nNet income in fiscal 2018 increased $1,129,000 or 3% to $43,143,000 compared to $42,014,000 in fiscal 2017. The increase in net income in 2018 was primarily due to: (a) increase in gross profit on sales, positively impacted by our second quarter of 2018 acquisition of Zappa Stewart, along with increased royalties and commissions revenue; (b) a gain on sale of license and a gain on sale of business, both related to the structural composites rod business; (c) the recognition of a lower Federal statutory tax rate; and (d) the excess tax benefit recognized related to our early adoption of ASU No. 2016-09. These gains were negatively impacted by increased amortization expense, as well as one-time acquisition-related and inventory step-up costs, recognized in fiscal 2018, related to our December 2017 acquisition of Zappa Stewart.\nOther Important Performance Measures\nWe believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are useful performance measures. They are used by our executive management team to measure operating performance, to allocate resources, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our Board of Directors and investors concerning our financial performance. The Company believes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are also useful to investors. EBITDA is useful in comparing the core operations of the business from period to period by removing the impact of the Company's capital structure (through interest expense), asset base (through depreciation and amortization) and tax rate, and in evaluating operating performance relative to others in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA allows for comparison to the Company's performance in prior periods without the effect of items that, by their nature, tend to obscure the Company's core operating results due to the potential variability across periods based on their timing, frequency and magnitude. Free Cash Flow provides a means for measuring the cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory obligations, including interest payments and debt repayment, and discretionary investment opportunities such as funding acquisitions, product and market development and paying dividends. As a result, management believes these metrics, which are commonly used by financial analysts and others in the industries in which the Company operates, enhance the ability of investors to analyze trends in the Company's business and evaluate the Company's performance relative to peer companies and the past performance of the Company itself. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest expense from borrowings, income tax expense, depreciation expense from fixed assets, and amortization expense from intangible assets. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding costs and (gains) losses related to our acquisitions and divestitures, costs of products sold related to inventory step-up to fair value, settlement (gains) losses resulting from lump-sum distributions to participants from our defined benefit plans, operations optimization costs, and other significant items. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nThe use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow has limitations and these performance measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, U.S. GAAP measures such as net income and net cash provided by operating activities. None of these measures should be interpreted as representing the residual cash flow of the Company available solely for discretionary expenditures or to invest in the growth of our business, since we may have certain non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from these measures, including scheduled principal and (in the case of Free Cash Flow) interest payments on outstanding debt. Our measurement of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable 44: <table> <tr>

$34,828,000 at August 31, 2018. The increased cash balance was primarily attributable to cash from operations of $49,535,000, partially offset by: (a) $25,000,000 in principal debt pay down on debt incurred to acquire Zappa Stewart in the prior year; and (b) a cash dividend payment of $7,522,000. Of the above noted amounts, $17,235,000 and $28,521,000 were held outside the U.S. by Chase Corporation and our foreign subsidiaries as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Given our cash position and borrowing capability in the United States and the potential for increased investment and acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions, prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (prior year), we did not have a history of repatriating a significant portion of our foreign cash. With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) in the second fiscal quarter of 2018, significant changes in the Internal Revenue Code were enacted, changing the U.S. taxable nature of previously unrepatriated foreign earnings. Following the passage of the Tax Act, the Company repatriated $10,499,000 in U.K. foreign earnings in fiscal 2018 and $17,230,000 in fiscal 2019. We do not currently take the position that undistributed foreign subsidiaries' earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. See Note 7 - Income Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further discussion of the effects of the Tax Act.\nOur cash balance decreased $12,526,000 to $34,828,000 at August 31, 2018 from $47,354,000 at August 31, 2017. The decreased cash balance was primarily attributable to: (a) the $73,469,000 acquisition of Zappa Stewart, partially offset by a $65,000,000 utilization of our all-revolving debt facility; (b) $40,000,000 in subsequent debt repayments; (c) a cash dividend payment of $7,497,000; and (d) $3,488,000 in purchases of machinery and equipment throughout fiscal 2018. The overall decrease was positively impacted by: (a) cash from operations of $46,071,000; (b) cash proceeds from the sale of our structural composites rod business of $2,232,000; and (c) cash proceeds from the sale of a license related to our structural composites business of $1,000,000.\nCash provided by operations was $49,535,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $46,071,000 in fiscal 2018. Cash provided by operations during fiscal 2019 was primarily due to operating income and decreased accounts receivable, which contracted on lower sales levels. Partially offsetting the overall increase of cash provided by operations were decreased payables.\nCash provided by operations was $46,071,000 for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $51,932,000 in fiscal 2017. Cash provided by operations during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to operating income and increased accounts payable, which rose on increased inventory balances. Partially offsetting the overall amount of cash provided by operations were increased inventory (as the Company made opportunistic purchases of non-perishable materials to take advantage of then current costs, which were believed to be lower than future costs), increased accounts receivable (following stronger fourth quarter sales in fiscal 2018) and decreases in accrued income taxes (as cash payments for taxes exceeded the amount of income tax expense recognized during the period).\nThe ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 6.0 as of August 31, 2019 compared to 4.4 as of August 31, 2018. The increase in our current ratio in fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to the Company's ability to increase cash and cash equivalents, while concurrently decreasing accounts payable during fiscal 2019.\nCash used in investing activities was $2,166,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $73,766,000 in fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019, cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash spent on capital purchases of machinery and equipment, partially offset by the final escrow payment received by the Company for our April 2017 sale of the fiber optic cable components business.\nCash used in investing activities was $73,766,000 for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $25,102,000 in fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2018, cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of Zappa Stewart in December 2017 and our purchases of machinery and equipment throughout fiscal 2018. Partially offsetting these uses of cash were; (a) cash proceeds from the sale of our structural composites rod business; and (b) cash proceeds from the sale of a license related to our structural composites business of $1,000,000.\nCash used in financing activities was $33,450,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $14,423,000 provided by financing activities in fiscal 2018 and $52,796,000 used in financing activities in fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, Chase repaid $25,000,000 and $40,000,000, respectively, on the $65,000,000 it borrowed on its revolving debt facility to substantially fund its purchase of Zappa Stewart in fiscal 2018. Chase also paid annual dividends of $7,522,000 and $7,497,000 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. During fiscal 2017, cash used in financing activities was primarily due to our annual dividend payment, payments made on the term debt used to finance our fiscal 2012 acquisition of NEPTCO and, after December 15, 2016, payments made on the Company's revolving credit facility, described in more detail below.\nOn November 13, 2019, we announced a cash dividend of $0.80 per share (totaling approximately $7,540,000) to shareholders of record on November 26, 2019 and payable on December 4, 2019.\nOn November 13, 2018, we announced a cash dividend of $0.80 per share (resulting in payment of $7,522,000) to shareholders of record on November 23, 2018 and payable on December 5, 2018.\nOn October 30, 2017, we announced a cash dividend of $0.80 per share (resulting in payment of $7,497,000) to shareholders of record on November 9, 2017 and payable on December 6, 2017.\nOn December 15, 2016, we entered an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Bank of America, acting as administrative agent, and with participation from Citizens Bank and JPMorgan Chase Bank (collectively with Bank of America, the Lenders\u201d). The Credit Agreement is initially an all-revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of $150,000,000, which can be increased by an additional $50,000,000 at the request of the Company and the individual or collective option of any of the Lenders. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and require certain lender approval for acquisitions by us and our subsidiaries over a certain size. It also requires us to maintain certain financial ratios on a consolidated basis, including a consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of no more than 3.25 to 1.00, and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of at least 1.25 to 1.00. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of August 31, 2019. The applicable interest rate for the Credit Agreement is based on the effective LIBOR plus an additional amount in the range of 1.00% to 1.75%, depending on our consolidated net leverage ratio or, at our option, at the bank's base lending rate. At August 31, 2019, there was no outstanding principal balance, and as such, no applicable interest rate. The Credit Agreement was used to refinance our previously existing credit facility, which consisted of a $70,000,000 five-year term loan entered into in June 2012 in connection with our acquisition of NEPTCO, together with a $15,000,000 revolving line of credit, each bearing interest at LIBOR plus an additional amount in the range of 1.75% to 2.25%, depending on our leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement also provides for additional liquidity to finance potential acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes.\nWe have several on-going capital projects, as well as our facility rationalization and consolidation initiative, which are important to our long-term strategic goals. Further, machinery and equipment will be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in our other manufacturing plants.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company announced it had begun moving the production of its pulling and detection products from its Granite Falls, NC location to its Hickory, NC location, with completion of the move expected to occur in the first half of fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2018, the Company announced the planned closing of its Pawtucket, RI manufacturing facility effective August 31, 2018. The manufacturing of products previously produced in the Pawtucket, RI facility was moved to Company facilities in Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC. These actions are in line with the Company's ongoing efforts to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its processes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company commissioned engineering studies to assess potential future operational changes and further plant rationalization and consolidation. A total of all potential future costs arising from any further plant rationalization and consolidation cannot be estimated at this time.\nWe may acquire companies or other assets in future periods which are complementary to our business. We believe that our existing resources, including cash on hand and the Credit Agreement, together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings, will be sufficient to fund our cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing, if needed, will be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nTo the extent that interest rates increase in future periods, we will assess the impact of these higher interest rates on the financial and cash flow projections of our potential acquisitions.\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at August 31, 2019 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands):\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments After\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal (1) (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n25,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWe may be required to make payments related to our unrecognized tax benefits.

See Note 9 - Benefits and Pension Plans\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information, including expected pension benefit payments for the next 10 years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor discussion of the newly issued accounting pronouncements see Recently Issued Accounting Standards\u201d and Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\u201d in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies. The SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and operating results, and requires management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are described below.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable balances based on a combination of factors. In cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer's ability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific allowance against amounts due to us is recorded, and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due, industry and geographic concentrations, the current business environment and our historical experience. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen, additional allowances may be required in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our future operating results.\nInventory\nWe value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held, forecasted demand and changes in technology. These assessments require management judgments and estimates, and valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory may be recorded based on these assessments. We estimate excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand, product transitions, and market conditions, and record adjustments to reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value. The failure to accurately forecast demand may lead to additional excess and obsolete inventory and future charges.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. We assess the fair value of assets, including intangible assets, using a variety of methods, and each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset, including a market participant's use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant. Assets recorded from the perspective of a market participant that are determined to not have economic use for us are expensed immediately. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a transaction to acquire a business are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets consist of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, trademarks, and patents and property, plant, and equipment. Intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, excluding goodwill, are amortized over their estimated useful life. We review long-lived assets and all intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill is also reviewed at least annually for impairment. We perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. In fiscal 2017, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2017-04 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Topics (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\u201d We assess goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit, is recorded. Fair values for reporting units are determined based on the income approach (discounted cash flow method).\nRevenue\nEffective September 1, 2018, the Company adopted accounting standard ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (ASC 606) using the modified retrospective method for contracts that were not completed as of August 31, 2018. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, whereby the cumulative impact of all prior periods is recorded in retained earnings or other impacted balance sheet line items upon adoption. The comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605. The impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and statements of operations, equity and cash flows as of the adoption date as a result of applying ASC 606 have been reflected within those respective financial statements. The Company's accounting policy has been updated to align with ASC 606.\nThe adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that provides enhanced revenue recognition disclosures. The Company accounts for revenue from contracts with customers when: (a) there is approval and commitment from both parties; (b) the rights of the parties are identified; (c) payment terms are identified; (d) the contract has commercial substance; and (e) collectability of consideration is probable. Revenue is primarily derived from customer purchase orders, master sales agreements, and negotiated contracts, all of which represent contracts with customers. See Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our accounting for revenue.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. Our contingent income tax liabilities are estimated based on the methodology prescribed in the guidance for accounting for uncertain tax positions. The guidance prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax-related exposures and settlements. Our assessment is based on our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities, as well as by current income tax trends. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our accounting for uncertain tax positions.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nWe evaluate the need for a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure compensation cost for share-based compensation at fair value and recognize the expense over the period that the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the vesting period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options. This model requires significant estimates related to the award's expected life and future stock price volatility of the underlying equity security. Historically, in determining the amount of expense to be recorded, we were required to estimate forfeiture rates for awards, based on the probability that employees will complete the required service period. We estimated the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. In fiscal 2017, we early adopted ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\u201d Following the adoption of the new standard, the Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.\nPension Benefits\nWe sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan covering employees of certain divisions of the Company. In calculating our retirement plan obligations and related expense, we make various assumptions and estimates. These assumptions include discount rates, benefits earned, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension obligations and future expense.\nEffective December 1, 2008, the Chase defined benefit pension plan was amended to include a soft freeze\u201d whereby any employee hired after the effective date of December 1, 2008 will not be admitted to the plan. The only exception related to employees who are members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union whose contract was amended to include a soft freeze whereby any employees hired after the effective date of July 15, 2012 will not be admitted to the plan. All eligible participants who were previously admitted to the plan prior to the applicable soft freeze dates will continue to accrue benefits as detailed in the plan agreements.\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary NEPTCO, we have another defined benefit pension plan which covered substantially all of our union employees at our Pawtucket, RI plant. This plan was frozen effective October 31, 2006, and as a result, no new participants can enter the plan and the benefits of current participants were frozen as of that date. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee's average compensation during the earlier of five years before retirement, or October 31, 2006. In August 2019, the Board of Directors voted to terminate the NEPTCO defined benefit plan. The Company has established that November 15, 2019 will serve as the plan termination date and is currently performing the administrative actions required to carry out the termination.\nWe account for our pension plans following the requirements of ASC Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits\u201d ( ASC 715\u201d). ASC 715 requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the funded status of a benefit plan; (b) measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employer's fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs pursuant to prior existing guidance.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation has not had a significant long-term impact on our earnings.

These decreases were tempered by a comparative bump from our December 2017 (fiscal 2018) acquired Zappa Stewart superabsorbents business, and organic sales growth in our primarily North American focused pulling and detection and cable materials product lines. Price increases continued during the current year to address elevated raw material costs, but came short of obtaining full margin recovery for the period.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company made further strides on its consolidation and rationalization initiative. We made substantial progress on relocating our pulling and detection product line production operations from our Granite Falls, NC facility to our Hickory, NC facility. The Company has been successful in not incurring elevated levels of manufacturing spend during pulling and detection's period of transition, which is anticipated to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2020. Operational efficiency gains were made in the latter half of the year at our Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC facilities, which absorbed the specialized cable material manufacturing operations of our Pawtucket, RI facility at the start of fiscal 2019. Following the move out of Pawtucket, higher manufacturing expenses were required to maintain service levels during the transition; these expenses were seen in the first half of fiscal 2019 but subsided in the second half of the year, and the Company is now beginning to recognize the long-term cost savings initially sought by combining the operations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities exceeded the prior year and, along with cash repatriated from our U.K. operations, was utilized to pay off in full the outstanding principal balance of our $150,000,000 revolving credit facility. The Company had borrowed $65,000,000 from the facility in December 2017 to substantially fund the acquisition of Zappa Stewart, and had begun paying down the balance in fiscal 2018. Our revolving credit facility allows for us to pay down debt when we have excess cash, while retaining access to immediate liquidity to fund future accretive activities as identified.\nRevenue from the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment increased over the prior year with our specialty chemical intermediates product line sales up over the prior year, with four additional months of operations of our acquired Zappa Stewart business in the current year. The segment's overall revenue increase was negatively impacted by decreased annual sales of our electronic and industrial coatings product line, which saw declines in the second half of the year on exposure to slower Asian markets, which were not fully offset by gains the product line experienced in North America.\nOur Industrial Tapes segment had a slight decrease in sales from the prior year, most notably related to the substantive divestiture of our structural composites product line in the third quarter of the prior year. Our electronic materials product line also contributed to the year-over-year decrease, as it faced headwinds selling into Asian end markets. Positively affecting the segment's top-line results for the year were our pulling and detection, cable materials and specialty products product lines, all with strong sales into North American markets.\nOur Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment's revenue declined from the prior year, primarily on decreased demand for our U.K. and U.S.-produced pipeline coatings products and our bridge and highway products. The overall decrease in sales experienced by the segment was tempered by increased sales of our building envelope and coating and lining systems products.\nThrough mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, our marketing and product development efforts and our ability to rationalize and consolidate our operations, the Company remains focused on its core strategies for sustainable long-term growth. At August 31, 2019, the Company's cash on hand was $47,771,000 and there was no balance outstanding on the Company's $150,000,000 revolving debt facility.\nThe Company has three reportable operating segments summarized below:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSegment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProduct Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nManufacturing Focus and Products\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdhesives, Sealants and Additives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nElectronic and Industrial Coatings\nSpecialty Chemical Intermediates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProtective coatings, including moisture protective coatings and customized sealant and adhesive systems for electronics; polyurethane dispersions, polymeric microspheres and superabsorbent polymers.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIndustrial Tapes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCable Materials\nSpecialty Products\nPulling and Detection\nElectronic Materials\nStructural Composites (1)\nFiber Optic Cable Components (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProtective tape and coating products and services, including insulating and conducting materials for wire and cable manufacturers; laminated durable papers, packaging and industrial laminate products and custom manufacturing services; pulling and detection tapes used in the installation, measurement and location of fiber optic cables and water and natural gas lines; cover tapes essential to delivering semiconductor components via tape and reel packaging; composite materials elements (now divested); glass-based strength elements designed to allow fiber optic cables to withstand mechanical and environmental strain and stress (now divested).\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCorrosion Protection and Waterproofing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCoating and Lining Systems\nPipeline Coatings\nBuilding Envelope\nBridge and Highway\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProtective coatings and tape products, including coating and lining systems for use in liquid storage and containment applications; protective coatings for pipeline and general construction applications; adhesives and sealants used in architectural and building envelope waterproofing applications; high-performance polymeric asphalt additives and expansion and control joint systems for use in the transportation and architectural markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Product line was substantially divested with the sale of the structural composites rod business on April 20, 2018.

increased $3,106,000 or 3% to $104,796,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $101,690,000 in fiscal 2018. The increase in revenue from our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from our specialty chemical intermediates product line totaling $7,083,000, which included the first full year of operations from the December 2017 acquired Zappa Stewart business. The segment's net sales increase was negatively affected by our electronic and industrial coatings product line's $3,977,000 sales-volume-driven decrease, with headwinds seen most acutely in Asian markets in the second half of the fiscal year. These headwinds also manifested in a decreased royalty received from our licensed manufacturer in Asia.\nRevenue in our Industrial Tapes segment decreased $753,000 or 1% to $129,845,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $130,598,000 in fiscal 2018. The decrease in revenue from our Industrial Tapes segment in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to: (a) a sales volume decrease of $5,077,000 from our structural composite products (following the Company's divestiture of the structural composites rod business in April 2018, product sales revenue for wind energy products significantly declined, and the Company has recognized wind-energy-related revenue, including royalty revenue and revenue for transitional custom manufacturing services performed for the buyer, in our specialty products product line since the sale); and (b) an entirely volume-driven sales decrease of $2,608,000 in our electronic materials product line, which has a near exclusively Asian end-market. These decreases were partially offset by: (a) a sales increase of $3,500,000 from our pulling and detection products, from volume and price-driven sales growth into large scale utility and telecommunications infrastructure build in North America; (b) an increase in revenue from our cable materials products of $2,880,000 on both volume and price; and (c) a sales volume increase of $552,000 for our specialty products, which, subsequent to the sale of our fiber optic cable components business in April 2017 and our structural composites rod business in April 2018, includes revenue from the manufacturing services provided by the Company to the common purchaser of the divested businesses (totaling $2,062,000 for fiscal 2019).\nRevenue from our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment decreased $5,190,000 or 10% to $46,710,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $51,900,000 for fiscal 2018. The decreased revenue for our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in sales totaling $4,680,000 in our pipeline coatings products. Our U.K.-produced water and wastewater pipeline products experienced the sharpest decline attributed to tight credit markets in the Middle East regions they sell into, while our U.S.-produced oil and gas pipeline products had sales levels only slightly below the prior year. Our bridge and highway products failed to repeat the large eastern U.S. bridge work laden prior year sales levels in the current year and were off by $2,353,000 year-over-year. Partially countering the overall decrease in revenue for the segment were: (a) a $952,000 increase in our building envelope product sales, driven predominantly by an increase in sales volume; and (b) coating and lining systems products, which had a revenue increase of $891,000.\nRoyalties and commissions in the Adhesive, Sealants and Additives and Industrial Tapes segments totaled $4,512,000, $5,226,000 and $4,683,000 for the years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in royalties and commissions in fiscal 2019 compared to both fiscal 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to decreased sales of electronic and industrial coatings products by our licensed manufacturer in Asia.\nExport sales from domestic operations to unaffiliated third parties were $30,582,000, $42,883,000 and $36,719,000 for the years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in export sales in fiscal 2019 against fiscal 2018 resulted from decreased export sales into China and Europe. Prior to its divestiture in the fiscal year 2018, nearly all sales related to our structural composite materials product line were into Europe. The increase in export sales in fiscal 2018 against fiscal 2017 resulted from increased export sales into China and Europe.\nIn fiscal 2018, total revenue increased $31,628,000 or 13% to $284,188,000 from $252,560,000 in the prior year. Revenue in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment increased $22,757,000 or 29% to $101,690,000 for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $78,933,000 in fiscal 2017. The increase in revenue from our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to: (a) increases in revenue from our specialty chemical intermediates product line totaling $17,383,000, which included sales of $16,324,000 related to the first eight months of operations from the acquired Zappa Stewart business; and (b) sales increases of $5,374,000 for our electronic and industrial coatings product line reflecting mainly sales volume increases, with some positive growth related to price, from the automotive, industrial controls and appliance manufacturing industries, along with increased sales from the Resin Designs business acquired in early fiscal 2017, and with an increased royalty received from our licensed manufacturer in Asia. Revenue in our Industrial Tapes segment increased $6,575,000 or 5% to $130,598,000 for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $124,023,000 in fiscal 2017. The increase in revenue from our Industrial Tapes segment in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to: (a) sales increases of $6,510,000, predominantly on volume, from our pulling and detection products, with large scale infrastructure build and repair work from the utility and telecommunications industries fueling growth; (b) sales volume increases of $3,902,000 for our specialty products, which, subsequent to the sale of our fiber optic cable components business in April 2017 and our structural composites rod business in April 2018, includes revenue from the manufacturing services provided by the Company to the common purchaser of the divested businesses (totaling $2,186,000 for fiscal 2018); (c) sales volume increases of $1,998,000 from our structural composite products on sales into the wind energy market (following the Company's divestiture of the structural composites rod business in April 2018, the Company began recognizing wind energy-related revenue, including royalty revenue and revenue for transitional custom manufacturing services performed for the buyer, in our specialty products product line); and (d) an entirely volume-driven sales increase of $472,000 in our electronic materials product line. These increases were negatively impacted by: (a) decreased sales of $4,340,000 from our fiber optic cable components product line, which the Company sold in April 2017 (no revenue was recorded within the fiber optic cable components product line following its divestiture early in the third quarter of 2017, including all of fiscal 2018); and (b) a net decrease in revenue from our cable materials products of $1,967,000, with decreases in sales volume more than offsetting pricing increases obtained. Revenue from our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment increased $2,296,000 or 5% to $51,900,000 for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $49,604,000 for fiscal 2017. The increased revenue for our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in sales volume and prices totaling $2,853,000 in our pipeline coatings products, with both our U.K.-produced water and wastewater pipeline products and U.S.-produced oil and gas pipeline products achieving increases over the prior year. Our bridge and highway products achieved a year-over-year increase in sales totaling $145,000, on both volume and price, compared to fiscal 2017, with large bridge infrastructure work in the eastern U.S. continuing in fiscal 2018. Partially countering the overall increase in revenue for the segment in fiscal 2018 were: (a) a $629,000 decrease in our building envelope product sales, driven predominantly by a decrease in sales volume; and (b) coating and lining systems products, which had a net revenue decrease of $73,000 on decreased sales volume offsetting increased sales prices.\nCost of Products and Services Sold\nCost of products and services sold increased $5,027,000 or 3% to $180,163,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $175,136,000 in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold increased to 64% in fiscal 2019 compared to 62% for fiscal 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the relative percentages of cost of products and services sold to revenue for our three operating segments:\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFiscal Years Ended August 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of products and services sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdhesives, Sealants and Additives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIndustrial Tapes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCorrosion Protection and Waterproofing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of products and services sold in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment was $60,345,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $53,324,000 in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment increased to 58% for fiscal 2019 compared to 52% in fiscal 2018. Cost of products and services sold in our Industrial Tapes segment was $93,299,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $92,418,000 in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment increased to 72% in fiscal 2019 compared to 71% for fiscal 2018. Cost of products and services sold in our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment was $26,519,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $29,394,000 in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment was consistent at 57% in both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services overall increased primarily due to: (a) a less favorable sales mix, most specifically felt in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment, as our lower margin products constituted a comparatively higher portion of total sales; (b) increasing supply and demand imbalances and tariffs causing rising raw material costs; and (c) production inefficiencies and additional costs to maintain service levels in the first half of fiscal 2019 at our Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC locations following the consolidation of our Pawtucket, RI operations. We purchase a wide variety of commodity items, including petroleum-based solvents, films, yarns, polymers and nonwovens, along with base metals (aluminum and copper), as well as many other substrates. To facilitate control of our margins, we closely monitor the pricing of our commodities-based raw materials across all product lines, as their price volatility can have short- and long-term effects on both our customers' demand for our products and the margins at which we are able to sell them.\nCost of products and services sold in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment was $53,324,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $37,190,000 in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment increased to 52% for fiscal 2018 compared to 47% in fiscal 2017. Cost of products and services sold in our Industrial Tapes segment was $92,418,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $81,919,000 in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment increased to 71% for fiscal 2018 compared to 66% in fiscal 2017. Cost of products and services sold in our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment was $29,394,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $26,927,000 in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment increased to 57% in fiscal 2018 compared to 54% for fiscal 2017. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in the three segments increased primarily due to: (a) the effects of international and domestic trade policy on raw material costs, which most acutely rose in the latter half of fiscal 2018; (b) the rising costs of petroleum-based inputs; (c) an unfavorable product mix, most prominently in our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment, as our lower margin products constituted a comparatively higher portion of total sales in fiscal year 2018; and (d) in the case of our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment the inclusion of $1,070,000 in cost of sale of inventory step-up, related to inventory purchased as part of our fiscal 2018 second quarter acquisition of Zappa Stewart.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $1,085,000 or 2% to $52,728,000 during fiscal 2019 compared to $51,643,000 in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 19% of total revenue in fiscal 2019 compared to 18% for fiscal 2018. The year-over-year increase in expenses is primarily attributable to: (a) increased amortization expense of $638,000, primarily related to intangible assets acquired in our December 31, 2017 acquisition of Zappa Stewart; (b) increased selling and commission expense of $252,000, principally related to sales growth on our highest commissionable products in the current year, coupled with the addition of a full year of the established sales force of Zappa Stewart; and (c) increased research and development costs of $81,000, after the addition of the established research and development department within Zappa Stewart during the second quarter of the prior year. The Company continues to closely monitor spend with an emphasis on controlling costs and leveraging existing resources.\nDuring fiscal 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4,972,000 or 11% to $51,643,000 compared to $46,671,000 in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses stayed consistent at 18% of total revenue in both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. The year-over-year increase in expenses is primarily attributable to: (a) increased amortization expense of $2,680,000, primarily related to intangible assets acquired in our December 31, 2017 acquisition of Zappa Stewart, and a full twelve months of amortization related to our September 30, 2016 acquisition of certain assets of Resin Designs; (b) increased selling and commission expense of $773,000, principally related to sales growth on our highest commissionable products in fiscal year 2018, coupled with the addition of the established sales force of Zappa Stewart and a full twelve months of the established sales force of Resin Designs; and (c) increased research and development expense of $244,000, principally related to fiscal year 2018 addition of the established research and development department of Zappa Stewart and a full twelve months of operation of the established research and development department of Resin Designs.\nLoss on Impairment of Goodwill\nDuring the three-month period ended February 28, 2019 (the second fiscal quarter of 2019), the ordering patterns of our polyurethane dispersions reporting unit's customers, especially those in the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in the reporting unit's backlog of customer orders believed to be firm as of February 28, 2019, indicated that an impairment in the carrying value of the reporting unit might have occurred. As such, we performed an impairment test on our indefinite-lived and long-lived assets related to our polyurethane dispersions reporting unit, now part of the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives operating segment (part of the former Industrial Materials segment during the second fiscal quarter of 2019), in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d and ASC Topic 360, Disclosure - Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\u201d As a result of impairment testing, which included first testing long-lived assets other than goodwill for impairment under applicable guidance, the Company recorded a charge of $2,410,000 to loss on impairment of goodwill within the consolidated statement of operations during the quarter ended February 28, 2019.\nOperations Optimization Costs\nDuring the second half of fiscal 2019, Chase began moving the pulling and detection operations housed in its Granite Falls, NC location to its Hickory, NC facility. This is in line with the Company's ongoing initiative to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its processes. Currently, the pulling and detection operations are the only Chase-owned production operations in Granite Falls, NC, with the remaining portions of the building being either utilized for research and development or leased to a third party. The process of moving has continued subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and is anticipated to be completed during the first half of fiscal 2020. The Company recognized $526,000 in expense related to the move in fiscal 2019. Future costs related to this move are currently anticipated to be approximately $700,000, and the Company plans to disclose these amounts separately on the Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, Chase commissioned engineering studies of certain legacy operations, machinery and locations related to the Company's ongoing facility rationalization and consolidation initiative. Chase is currently reviewing the data and recommendations provided by the study and may further utilize third party engineering, IT and other professional services firms in the future for similar optimization-related work. The Company recognized $200,000 in expense related to these services in fiscal 2019; but given the ongoing nature of the review, an estimate of future costs cannot currently be determined.\nOn June 25, 2018, the Company announced to its employees the planned closing of its Pawtucket, RI manufacturing facility effective August 31, 2018. This was in line with the Company's ongoing efforts to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its processes. The manufacture of products previously produced in the Pawtucket, RI facility was substantially moved to existing Company facilities in Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC during a two-month transition period, with certain additional expenditures recognized in the first fiscal quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, $1,272,000 was expensed related to the closure, including: (a) cash-related employee-related, logistics and uncapitalized facilities improvement costs of $590,000; and (b) non-cash-related accelerated depreciation expense of $682,000. The Company expensed $260,000 in the three-month period ended November 30, 2018 related to the move, with no additional expense recognized in fiscal 2019. Future costs related to this move are not anticipated to be significant to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized $70,000 and $935,000, respectively, in expenses to raze its Randolph, MA facility, which had been idle regarding production for several years. No expense related to this project was recognized in fiscal 2018 or 2019. The Company began marketing the site for sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The Company substantially completed the demolition of the structure in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, and completed other environmental aspects of the project during fiscal 2017. The sale of the property is anticipated to follow in a subsequent period, and any future expenses related to the project are not anticipated to be material.\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nIn fiscal 2018, the Company incurred $393,000 of costs related to our acquisition of Zappa Stewart. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and all related professional service fees (including banking, legal, accounting and actuarial fees) were expensed as incurred within the second fiscal quarter of 2018.\nIn fiscal 2017, the Company incurred $584,000 of costs related to our acquisition of certain assets of Resin Designs. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and all related professional service fees (including banking, legal, accounting, and actuarial fees) were expensed as incurred during the year ended August 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $653,000 or 56% to $519,000 in fiscal 2019 compared to $1,172,000 in fiscal 2018. Interest expense increased $333,000 or 40% to $1,172,000 in fiscal 2018 compared to $839,000 in fiscal 2017. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2019 is the result of the decreased average outstanding balance of Chase's revolving debt facility, following the $65,000,000 draw on the facility in December 2017 to substantially fund the Company's acquisition of Zappa Stewart and subsequent incremental principal payments made.\nIn fiscal 2018, subsequent to the December 2017 borrowing, the Company made $40,000,000 in payments against the principal. In fiscal 2019, Chase made an additional $25,000,000 in principal payments, paying off the outstanding balance in full as of August 31, 2019.\nGain on Sale of Real Estate\nIn November 2016, the Company finalized the sale of its Paterson, NJ property for proceeds of $1,382,000. This transaction resulted in a gain of $792,000 which was recorded during the year ended August 31, 2017.\nIn October 2016, Chase entered an agreement to sell its former corporate headquarters and executive offices in Bridgewater, MA. In December 2016, the sale was finalized for gross proceeds of $740,000, resulting in a gain on sale of $68,000 recognized during the year ended August 31, 2017.\nGain on Sale of License\nIn November 2017, the Company entered an agreement with an unrelated party to sell a license, including certain intellectual property, and sell certain construction in process assets, both related to the manufacturing of certain structural composite materials. In the second fiscal quarter of 2018, the transaction was finalized for gross consideration of $1,111,000 comprising cash proceeds of $1,000,000 and foreign tax consideration paid by the purchaser on Chase's behalf of $111,000. This transaction resulted in a gain of $1,085,000, which was recorded as a gain on sale of license during the fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2018.\nIn relation to this license agreement, the purchaser also entered into a royalty agreement with the Company. The purchaser will make royalty payments to Chase based on the volume of future sales of certain structural composite material manufactured by the purchaser. Revenue recognized related to this royalty agreement was not material in fiscal 2019 or 2018, and this royalty agreement was terminated in fiscal 2019.\nGain on Sale of Businesses\nOn April 20, 2018, Chase finalized an agreement with an unrelated party to sell all inventory, operational machinery and equipment and intangible assets of the Company's structural composites rod business, as well as a license related to the production and sale of rod, for proceeds of $2,232,000, net of transaction costs and following certain working capital adjustments. This business, which was part of the structural composites product line within the Industrial Tapes segment, had limited growth and profitability prospects as part of the Company, and was outside the areas Chase has identified for strategic emphasis. The resulting pre-tax gain on sale of $1,480,000 was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as a gain on sale of businesses within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Chase received $2,075,000, net of transaction costs, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, with the remaining $157,000 received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as a result of a working capital true-up. Chase will provide certain transitional manufacturing and administrative support to the purchaser for which the Company will receive additional consideration upon the performance of services.\nIn relation to this transaction, the purchaser entered into a royalty agreement with the Company. The purchaser will make royalty payments to Chase based on future sales of certain structural composite material manufactured by the purchaser. Royalty revenue recognized in 2019 and 2018 related to this agreement was not material.\nOn April 3, 2017, Chase executed an agreement with an unrelated party to sell all inventory, machinery and equipment and intangible assets of its fiber optic cable components product line for proceeds of $3,858,000, net of transaction costs and following all working capital adjustments. The fiber optic cable components product line had been a part of our Industrial Tapes segment. Given its low-growth and low-margin prospects, and a customer, supplier and equipment base separate from our other businesses, the product line was determined to not be part of Chase's long-term strategy. The resulting pre-tax gain on sale of $2,013,000 was recognized during the year ended August 31, 2017. Further, the purchaser entered a multiyear lease for a portion of the manufacturing space at the Company's Granite Falls, NC facility. Chase will provide certain transitional manufacturing and administrative support to the purchaser for which the Company will receive additional consideration upon the performance of services.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther expense was $992,000 in fiscal 2019 compared to other expense of $172,000 in fiscal 2018, an increase of $820,000. Other income (expense) primarily includes foreign exchange gains (losses) caused by changes in exchange rates on transactions or balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, non-service cost components of periodic pension expense (including pension-related settlement costs due to the timing of lump-sum distributions), interest income, rental income and other non-trade/non-royalty/non-commission receipts. The increase in total other expense in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was largely due to the recognition of $511,000 in pension-related settlement costs in fiscal 2019, while no such expense was recognized in fiscal 2018.\nOther expense was $172,000 in fiscal 2018 compared to other expense of $341,000 in fiscal 2017, a decrease of $169,000. The decrease in total other expense in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was largely due to the lower non-service cost component of periodic pension expense recognized in fiscal 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 24.9% as compared to 24.3% and 31.0% in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe current and prior years' effective tax rates were most prominently affected by the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) in December 2017 and discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognized in relation to the Company's early adoption of ASU 2016-09 and described in more detail below. For fiscal 2019, the Company utilized the new 21% Federal tax rate enacted by the Tax Act. During fiscal 2018, Chase utilized a blended rate of 25.7%, based on a combination of four months of operations under the old 35% corporate income tax rate, and eight months at the new 21% rate. During fiscal 2017, Chase utilized the old 35% corporate income tax rate for the entire period. Please see Note 7 - Income Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the effects of the Tax Act.\nThe Company early adopted ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d, during the first fiscal quarter of 2017. During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $157,000, $1,921,000 and $1,917,000, respectively, within income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The current year decrease in the benefit resulted from a decrease in certain stock option exercise activity in fiscal 2019. The Company anticipates the potential for increased periodic volatility in future effective tax rates based on the continued application of ASU No. 2016-09.\nNet Income\nNet income in fiscal 2019 decreased $10,432,000 or 24% to $32,711,000 compared to $43,143,000 in fiscal 2018. The decrease in net income in 2019 was primarily due to: (a) a lower gross profit on sales; (b) a loss on impairment of goodwill; (c) increased amortization expense recognized in the current period and related to our December 2017 acquisition of Zappa Stewart; (d) nonrecurring gains on sales of both a business and a license in the prior year period; and (e) increased pension-related settlement costs due to the timing of lump-sum disbursements in the current year-to-date period.\nNet income in fiscal 2018 increased $1,129,000 or 3% to $43,143,000 compared to $42,014,000 in fiscal 2017. The increase in net income in 2018 was primarily due to: (a) increase in gross profit on sales, positively impacted by our second quarter of 2018 acquisition of Zappa Stewart, along with increased royalties and commissions revenue; (b) a gain on sale of license and a gain on sale of business, both related to the structural composites rod business; (c) the recognition of a lower Federal statutory tax rate; and (d) the excess tax benefit recognized related to our early adoption of ASU No. 2016-09. These gains were negatively impacted by increased amortization expense, as well as one-time acquisition-related and inventory step-up costs, recognized in fiscal 2018, related to our December 2017 acquisition of Zappa Stewart.\nOther Important Performance Measures\nWe believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are useful performance measures. They are used by our executive management team to measure operating performance, to allocate resources, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our Board of Directors and investors concerning our financial performance. The Company believes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are also useful to investors. EBITDA is useful in comparing the core operations of the business from period to period by removing the impact of the Company's capital structure (through interest expense), asset base (through depreciation and amortization) and tax rate, and in evaluating operating performance relative to others in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA allows for comparison to the Company's performance in prior periods without the effect of items that, by their nature, tend to obscure the Company's core operating results due to the potential variability across periods based on their timing, frequency and magnitude. Free Cash Flow provides a means for measuring the cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory obligations, including interest payments and debt repayment, and discretionary investment opportunities such as funding acquisitions, product and market development and paying dividends. As a result, management believes these metrics, which are commonly used by financial analysts and others in the industries in which the Company operates, enhance the ability of investors to analyze trends in the Company's business and evaluate the Company's performance relative to peer companies and the past performance of the Company itself. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest expense from borrowings, income tax expense, depreciation expense from fixed assets, and amortization expense from intangible assets. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding costs and (gains) losses related to our acquisitions and divestitures, costs of products sold related to inventory step-up to fair value, settlement (gains) losses resulting from lump-sum distributions to participants from our defined benefit plans, operations optimization costs, and other significant items. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nThe use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow has limitations and these performance measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, U.S. GAAP measures such as net income and net cash provided by operating activities. None of these measures should be interpreted as representing the residual cash flow of the Company available solely for discretionary expenditures or to invest in the growth of our business, since we may have certain non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from these measures, including scheduled principal and (in the case of Free Cash Flow) interest payments on outstanding debt. Our measurement of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nTable 44: <table> <tr>

</tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Sources of Capital\nOur cash balance increased $12,943,000 to $47,771,000 at August 31, 2019 from $34,828,000 at August 31, 2018. The increased cash balance was primarily attributable to cash from operations of $49,535,000, partially offset by: (a) $25,000,000 in principal debt pay down on debt incurred to acquire Zappa Stewart in the prior year; and (b) a cash dividend payment of $7,522,000. Of the above noted amounts, $17,235,000 and $28,521,000 were held outside the U.S. by Chase Corporation and our foreign subsidiaries as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Given our cash position and borrowing capability in the United States and the potential for increased investment and acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions, prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (prior year), we did not have a history of repatriating a significant portion of our foreign cash. With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) in the second fiscal quarter of 2018, significant changes in the Internal Revenue Code were enacted, changing the U.S. taxable nature of previously unrepatriated foreign earnings. Following the passage of the Tax Act, the Company repatriated $10,499,000 in U.K. foreign earnings in fiscal 2018 and $17,230,000 in fiscal 2019. We do not currently take the position that undistributed foreign subsidiaries' earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. See Note 7 - Income Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further discussion of the effects of the Tax Act.\nOur cash balance decreased $12,526,000 to $34,828,000 at August 31, 2018 from $47,354,000 at August 31, 2017. The decreased cash balance was primarily attributable to: (a) the $73,469,000 acquisition of Zappa Stewart, partially offset by a $65,000,000 utilization of our all-revolving debt facility; (b) $40,000,000 in subsequent debt repayments; (c) a cash dividend payment of $7,497,000; and (d) $3,488,000 in purchases of machinery and equipment throughout fiscal 2018. The overall decrease was positively impacted by: (a) cash from operations of $46,071,000; (b) cash proceeds from the sale of our structural composites rod business of $2,232,000; and (c) cash proceeds from the sale of a license related to our structural composites business of $1,000,000.\nCash provided by operations was $49,535,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $46,071,000 in fiscal 2018. Cash provided by operations during fiscal 2019 was primarily due to operating income and decreased accounts receivable, which contracted on lower sales levels. Partially offsetting the overall increase of cash provided by operations were decreased payables.\nCash provided by operations was $46,071,000 for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $51,932,000 in fiscal 2017. Cash provided by operations during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to operating income and increased accounts payable, which rose on increased inventory balances. Partially offsetting the overall amount of cash provided by operations were increased inventory (as the Company made opportunistic purchases of non-perishable materials to take advantage of then current costs, which were believed to be lower than future costs), increased accounts receivable (following stronger fourth quarter sales in fiscal 2018) and decreases in accrued income taxes (as cash payments for taxes exceeded the amount of income tax expense recognized during the period).\nThe ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 6.0 as of August 31, 2019 compared to 4.4 as of August 31, 2018. The increase in our current ratio in fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to the Company's ability to increase cash and cash equivalents, while concurrently decreasing accounts payable during fiscal 2019.\nCash used in investing activities was $2,166,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $73,766,000 in fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019, cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash spent on capital purchases of machinery and equipment, partially offset by the final escrow payment received by the Company for our April 2017 sale of the fiber optic cable components business.\nCash used in investing activities was $73,766,000 for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $25,102,000 in fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2018, cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of Zappa Stewart in December 2017 and our purchases of machinery and equipment throughout fiscal 2018. Partially offsetting these uses of cash were; (a) cash proceeds from the sale of our structural composites rod business; and (b) cash proceeds from the sale of a license related to our structural composites business of $1,000,000.\nCash used in financing activities was $33,450,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $14,423,000 provided by financing activities in fiscal 2018 and $52,796,000 used in financing activities in fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, Chase repaid $25,000,000 and $40,000,000, respectively, on the $65,000,000 it borrowed on its revolving debt facility to substantially fund its purchase of Zappa Stewart in fiscal 2018. Chase also paid annual dividends of $7,522,000 and $7,497,000 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. During fiscal 2017, cash used in financing activities was primarily due to our annual dividend payment, payments made on the term debt used to finance our fiscal 2012 acquisition of NEPTCO and, after December 15, 2016, payments made on the Company's revolving credit facility, described in more detail below.\nOn November 13, 2019, we announced a cash dividend of $0.80 per share (totaling approximately $7,540,000) to shareholders of record on November 26, 2019 and payable on December 4, 2019.\nOn November 13, 2018, we announced a cash dividend of $0.80 per share (resulting in payment of $7,522,000) to shareholders of record on November 23, 2018 and payable on December 5, 2018.\nOn October 30, 2017, we announced a cash dividend of $0.80 per share (resulting in payment of $7,497,000) to shareholders of record on November 9, 2017 and payable on December 6, 2017.\nOn December 15, 2016, we entered an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Bank of America, acting as administrative agent, and with participation from Citizens Bank and JPMorgan Chase Bank (collectively with Bank of America, the Lenders\u201d). The Credit Agreement is initially an all-revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of $150,000,000, which can be increased by an additional $50,000,000 at the request of the Company and the individual or collective option of any of the Lenders. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and require certain lender approval for acquisitions by us and our subsidiaries over a certain size. It also requires us to maintain certain financial ratios on a consolidated basis, including a consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of no more than 3.25 to 1.00, and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of at least 1.25 to 1.00. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of August 31, 2019. The applicable interest rate for the Credit Agreement is based on the effective LIBOR plus an additional amount in the range of 1.00% to 1.75%, depending on our consolidated net leverage ratio or, at our option, at the bank's base lending rate. At August 31, 2019, there was no outstanding principal balance, and as such, no applicable interest rate. The Credit Agreement was used to refinance our previously existing credit facility, which consisted of a $70,000,000 five-year term loan entered into in June 2012 in connection with our acquisition of NEPTCO, together with a $15,000,000 revolving line of credit, each bearing interest at LIBOR plus an additional amount in the range of 1.75% to 2.25%, depending on our leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement also provides for additional liquidity to finance potential acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes.\nWe have several on-going capital projects, as well as our facility rationalization and consolidation initiative, which are important to our long-term strategic goals. Further, machinery and equipment will be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in our other manufacturing plants.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company announced it had begun moving the production of its pulling and detection products from its Granite Falls, NC location to its Hickory, NC location, with completion of the move expected to occur in the first half of fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2018, the Company announced the planned closing of its Pawtucket, RI manufacturing facility effective August 31, 2018. The manufacturing of products previously produced in the Pawtucket, RI facility was moved to Company facilities in Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC. These actions are in line with the Company's ongoing efforts to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its processes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company commissioned engineering studies to assess potential future operational changes and further plant rationalization and consolidation. A total of all potential future costs arising from any further plant rationalization and consolidation cannot be estimated at this time.\nWe may acquire companies or other assets in future periods which are complementary to our business. We believe that our existing resources, including cash on hand and the Credit Agreement, together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings, will be sufficient to fund our cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing, if needed, will be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nTo the extent that interest rates increase in future periods, we will assess the impact of these higher interest rates on the financial and cash flow projections of our potential acquisitions.\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at August 31, 2019 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands):\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments Due\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments After\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal (1) (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n25,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) We may be required to make payments related to our unrecognized tax benefits. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $2,324,000 as of August 31, 2019 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 7 - Income Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. \n (2) This table does not include the expected payments for our obligations for pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. As of August 31, 2019, we had recognized an accrued benefit plan liability of $12,228,000 representing the unfunded obligations of the pension benefit plans. See Note 9 - Benefits and Pension Plans\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information, including expected pension benefit payments for the next 10 years. \nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor discussion of the newly issued accounting pronouncements see Recently Issued Accounting Standards\u201d and Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\u201d in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies. The SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and operating results, and requires management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are described below.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable balances based on a combination of factors. In cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer's ability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific allowance against amounts due to us is recorded, and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due, industry and geographic concentrations, the current business environment and our historical experience. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen, additional allowances may be required in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our future operating results.\nInventory\nWe value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held, forecasted demand and changes in technology. These assessments require management judgments and estimates, and valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory may be recorded based on these assessments. We estimate excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand, product transitions, and market conditions, and record adjustments to reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value. The failure to accurately forecast demand may lead to additional excess and obsolete inventory and future charges.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. We assess the fair value of assets, including intangible assets, using a variety of methods, and each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset, including a market participant's use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant. Assets recorded from the perspective of a market participant that are determined to not have economic use for us are expensed immediately. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a transaction to acquire a business are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets consist of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, trademarks, and patents and property, plant, and equipment. Intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, excluding goodwill, are amortized over their estimated useful life. We review long-lived assets and all intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill is also reviewed at least annually for impairment. We perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. In fiscal 2017, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2017-04 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Topics (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\u201d We assess goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit, is recorded. Fair values for reporting units are determined based on the income approach (discounted cash flow method).\nRevenue\nEffective September 1, 2018, the Company adopted accounting standard ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (ASC 606) using the modified retrospective method for contracts that were not completed as of August 31, 2018. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, whereby the cumulative impact of all prior periods is recorded in retained earnings or other impacted balance sheet line items upon adoption. The comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605. The impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and statements of operations, equity and cash flows as of the adoption date as a result of applying ASC 606 have been reflected within those respective financial statements. The Company's accounting policy has been updated to align with ASC 606.\nThe adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that provides enhanced revenue recognition disclosures. The Company accounts for revenue from contracts with customers when: (a) there is approval and commitment from both parties; (b) the rights of the parties are identified; (c) payment terms are identified; (d) the contract has commercial substance; and (e) collectability of consideration is probable. Revenue is primarily derived from customer purchase orders, master sales agreements, and negotiated contracts, all of which represent contracts with customers. See Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our accounting for revenue.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. Our contingent income tax liabilities are estimated based on the methodology prescribed in the guidance for accounting for uncertain tax positions. The guidance prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax-related exposures and settlements. Our assessment is based on our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities, as well as by current income tax trends. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our accounting for uncertain tax positions.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nWe evaluate the need for a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure compensation cost for share-based compensation at fair value and recognize the expense over the period that the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the vesting period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options. This model requires significant estimates related to the award's expected life and future stock price volatility of the underlying equity security. Historically, in determining the amount of expense to be recorded, we were required to estimate forfeiture rates for awards, based on the probability that employees will complete the required service period. We estimated the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. In fiscal 2017, we early adopted ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\u201d Following the adoption of the new standard, the Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.\nPension Benefits\nWe sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan covering employees of certain divisions of the Company. In calculating our retirement plan obligations and related expense, we make various assumptions and estimates. These assumptions include discount rates, benefits earned, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension obligations and future expense.\nEffective December 1, 2008, the Chase defined benefit pension plan was amended to include a soft freeze\u201d whereby any employee hired after the effective date of December 1, 2008 will not be admitted to the plan. The only exception related to employees who are members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union whose contract was amended to include a soft freeze whereby any employees hired after the effective date of July 15, 2012 will not be admitted to the plan. All eligible participants who were previously admitted to the plan prior to the applicable soft freeze dates will continue to accrue benefits as detailed in the plan agreements.\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary NEPTCO, we have another defined benefit pension plan which covered substantially all of our union employees at our Pawtucket, RI plant. This plan was frozen effective October 31, 2006, and as a result, no new participants can enter the plan and the benefits of current participants were frozen as of that date. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee's average compensation during the earlier of five years before retirement, or October 31, 2006. In August 2019, the Board of Directors voted to terminate the NEPTCO defined benefit plan. The Company has established that November 15, 2019 will serve as the plan termination date and is currently performing the administrative actions required to carry out the termination.\nWe account for our pension plans following the requirements of ASC Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits\u201d ( ASC 715\u201d). ASC 715 requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the funded status of a benefit plan; (b) measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employer's fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs pursuant to prior existing guidance.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation has not had a significant long-term impact on our earnings. In the event of significant inflation, our efforts to recover cost increases would be hampered as a result of the competitive nature of the industries in which we operate.", "item_7_text": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion provides an analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSelected Relationships within the Consolidated Statements of Operations\n\n* denotes less than one percent\nNote: Some percentage of revenue amounts may not sum due to rounding\nOverview\nThe Company's revenue contracted in the current year, affected by challenges faced in Asian markets, a tight credit market in the Middle East and the prior year divestiture of our structural composites rod business. These decreases were tempered by a comparative bump from our December 2017 (fiscal 2018) acquired Zappa Stewart superabsorbents business, and organic sales growth in our primarily North American focused pulling and detection and cable materials product lines. Price increases continued during the current year to address elevated raw material costs, but came short of obtaining full margin recovery for the period.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company made further strides on its consolidation and rationalization initiative. We made substantial progress on relocating our pulling and detection product line production operations from our Granite Falls, NC facility to our Hickory, NC facility. The Company has been successful in not incurring elevated levels of manufacturing spend during pulling and detection's period of transition, which is anticipated to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2020. Operational efficiency gains were made in the latter half of the year at our Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC facilities, which absorbed the specialized cable material manufacturing operations of our Pawtucket, RI facility at the start of fiscal 2019. Following the move out of Pawtucket, higher manufacturing expenses were required to maintain service levels during the transition; these expenses were seen in the first half of fiscal 2019 but subsided in the second half of the year, and the Company is now beginning to recognize the long-term cost savings initially sought by combining the operations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities exceeded the prior year and, along with cash repatriated from our U.K. operations, was utilized to pay off in full the outstanding principal balance of our $150,000,000 revolving credit facility. The Company had borrowed $65,000,000 from the facility in December 2017 to substantially fund the acquisition of Zappa Stewart, and had begun paying down the balance in fiscal 2018. Our revolving credit facility allows for us to pay down debt when we have excess cash, while retaining access to immediate liquidity to fund future accretive activities as identified.\nRevenue from the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment increased over the prior year with our specialty chemical intermediates product line sales up over the prior year, with four additional months of operations of our acquired Zappa Stewart business in the current year. The segment's overall revenue increase was negatively impacted by decreased annual sales of our electronic and industrial coatings product line, which saw declines in the second half of the year on exposure to slower Asian markets, which were not fully offset by gains the product line experienced in North America.\nOur Industrial Tapes segment had a slight decrease in sales from the prior year, most notably related to the substantive divestiture of our structural composites product line in the third quarter of the prior year. Our electronic materials product line also contributed to the year-over-year decrease, as it faced headwinds selling into Asian end markets. Positively affecting the segment's top-line results for the year were our pulling and detection, cable materials and specialty products product lines, all with strong sales into North American markets.\nOur Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment's revenue declined from the prior year, primarily on decreased demand for our U.K. and U.S.-produced pipeline coatings products and our bridge and highway products. The overall decrease in sales experienced by the segment was tempered by increased sales of our building envelope and coating and lining systems products.\nThrough mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, our marketing and product development efforts and our ability to rationalize and consolidate our operations, the Company remains focused on its core strategies for sustainable long-term growth. At August 31, 2019, the Company's cash on hand was $47,771,000 and there was no balance outstanding on the Company's $150,000,000 revolving debt facility.\nThe Company has three reportable operating segments summarized below:\n\n (1) Product line was substantially divested with the sale of the structural composites rod business on April 20, 2018. Custom manufacturing performed for the purchaser of the structural composites rod business subsequent to the sale is included within the specialty products product line. \n (2) Results of product line included for period prior to its April 3, 2017 sale by the Company. \nResults of Operations\nRevenue and Income Before Income Taxes by Segment are as follows:\n\n (a) Includes $2,410 of loss on impairment of goodwill related to the Company's polyurethane dispersions business \n (b) Includes $260 of expense related to the closure and exit of our Pawtucket, RI location recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, and $526 in exit costs related to the movement of the pulling and detection business out of the Granite Falls, NC location and into the Hickory, NC location during the second half of fiscal 2019 \n (c) Includes $200 of expense related to engineering studies performed to assess potential future operational changes and further plant rationalization and consolidation \n (d) Includes $511 of pension-related settlement costs due to the timing of lump-sum distributions \n (e) Includes $1,070 of expense related to inventory step-up in fair value attributable to the acquisition of Zappa Stewart \n (f) Includes $1,085 gain on sale of license related to the structural composites product line recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, $1,480 gain on sale of business related to the April 2018 sale of the structural composites rod business and $1,272 of expense related to the exit of our Pawtucket, RI location in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 \n (g) Includes $393 in acquisition-related expense attributable to the December 2017 acquisition of Zappa Stewart \n (h) Includes $190 of expense related to inventory step-up in fair value attributable to the Resin Designs acquisition \n (i) Includes a $2,013 gain on sale of our fiber optic cable components business \n (j) Includes $584 in acquisition-related expense attributable to the September 2016 acquisition of certain assets of Resin Designs, facility exit and demolition costs of $70 related to the Company's Randolph, MA location, a $792 gain related to the November 2016 sale of the Company's Paterson, NJ location, a $68 gain related to the December 2016 sale of the Company's former corporate headquarters in Bridgewater, MA and $14 of pension-related settlement costs due to the timing of lump-sum distributions \nTotal Revenue\nTotal revenue in fiscal 2019 decreased $2,837,000 or 1% to $281,351,000 from $284,188,000 in the prior year.\nRevenue in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment increased $3,106,000 or 3% to $104,796,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $101,690,000 in fiscal 2018. The increase in revenue from our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to an increase in revenue from our specialty chemical intermediates product line totaling $7,083,000, which included the first full year of operations from the December 2017 acquired Zappa Stewart business. The segment's net sales increase was negatively affected by our electronic and industrial coatings product line's $3,977,000 sales-volume-driven decrease, with headwinds seen most acutely in Asian markets in the second half of the fiscal year. These headwinds also manifested in a decreased royalty received from our licensed manufacturer in Asia.\nRevenue in our Industrial Tapes segment decreased $753,000 or 1% to $129,845,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $130,598,000 in fiscal 2018. The decrease in revenue from our Industrial Tapes segment in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to: (a) a sales volume decrease of $5,077,000 from our structural composite products (following the Company's divestiture of the structural composites rod business in April 2018, product sales revenue for wind energy products significantly declined, and the Company has recognized wind-energy-related revenue, including royalty revenue and revenue for transitional custom manufacturing services performed for the buyer, in our specialty products product line since the sale); and (b) an entirely volume-driven sales decrease of $2,608,000 in our electronic materials product line, which has a near exclusively Asian end-market. These decreases were partially offset by: (a) a sales increase of $3,500,000 from our pulling and detection products, from volume and price-driven sales growth into large scale utility and telecommunications infrastructure build in North America; (b) an increase in revenue from our cable materials products of $2,880,000 on both volume and price; and (c) a sales volume increase of $552,000 for our specialty products, which, subsequent to the sale of our fiber optic cable components business in April 2017 and our structural composites rod business in April 2018, includes revenue from the manufacturing services provided by the Company to the common purchaser of the divested businesses (totaling $2,062,000 for fiscal 2019).\nRevenue from our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment decreased $5,190,000 or 10% to $46,710,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $51,900,000 for fiscal 2018. The decreased revenue for our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in sales totaling $4,680,000 in our pipeline coatings products. Our U.K.-produced water and wastewater pipeline products experienced the sharpest decline attributed to tight credit markets in the Middle East regions they sell into, while our U.S.-produced oil and gas pipeline products had sales levels only slightly below the prior year. Our bridge and highway products failed to repeat the large eastern U.S. bridge work laden prior year sales levels in the current year and were off by $2,353,000 year-over-year. Partially countering the overall decrease in revenue for the segment were: (a) a $952,000 increase in our building envelope product sales, driven predominantly by an increase in sales volume; and (b) coating and lining systems products, which had a revenue increase of $891,000.\nRoyalties and commissions in the Adhesive, Sealants and Additives and Industrial Tapes segments totaled $4,512,000, $5,226,000 and $4,683,000 for the years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in royalties and commissions in fiscal 2019 compared to both fiscal 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to decreased sales of electronic and industrial coatings products by our licensed manufacturer in Asia.\nExport sales from domestic operations to unaffiliated third parties were $30,582,000, $42,883,000 and $36,719,000 for the years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in export sales in fiscal 2019 against fiscal 2018 resulted from decreased export sales into China and Europe. Prior to its divestiture in the fiscal year 2018, nearly all sales related to our structural composite materials product line were into Europe. The increase in export sales in fiscal 2018 against fiscal 2017 resulted from increased export sales into China and Europe.\nIn fiscal 2018, total revenue increased $31,628,000 or 13% to $284,188,000 from $252,560,000 in the prior year. Revenue in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment increased $22,757,000 or 29% to $101,690,000 for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $78,933,000 in fiscal 2017. The increase in revenue from our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to: (a) increases in revenue from our specialty chemical intermediates product line totaling $17,383,000, which included sales of $16,324,000 related to the first eight months of operations from the acquired Zappa Stewart business; and (b) sales increases of $5,374,000 for our electronic and industrial coatings product line reflecting mainly sales volume increases, with some positive growth related to price, from the automotive, industrial controls and appliance manufacturing industries, along with increased sales from the Resin Designs business acquired in early fiscal 2017, and with an increased royalty received from our licensed manufacturer in Asia. Revenue in our Industrial Tapes segment increased $6,575,000 or 5% to $130,598,000 for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $124,023,000 in fiscal 2017. The increase in revenue from our Industrial Tapes segment in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to: (a) sales increases of $6,510,000, predominantly on volume, from our pulling and detection products, with large scale infrastructure build and repair work from the utility and telecommunications industries fueling growth; (b) sales volume increases of $3,902,000 for our specialty products, which, subsequent to the sale of our fiber optic cable components business in April 2017 and our structural composites rod business in April 2018, includes revenue from the manufacturing services provided by the Company to the common purchaser of the divested businesses (totaling $2,186,000 for fiscal 2018); (c) sales volume increases of $1,998,000 from our structural composite products on sales into the wind energy market (following the Company's divestiture of the structural composites rod business in April 2018, the Company began recognizing wind energy-related revenue, including royalty revenue and revenue for transitional custom manufacturing services performed for the buyer, in our specialty products product line); and (d) an entirely volume-driven sales increase of $472,000 in our electronic materials product line. These increases were negatively impacted by: (a) decreased sales of $4,340,000 from our fiber optic cable components product line, which the Company sold in April 2017 (no revenue was recorded within the fiber optic cable components product line following its divestiture early in the third quarter of 2017, including all of fiscal 2018); and (b) a net decrease in revenue from our cable materials products of $1,967,000, with decreases in sales volume more than offsetting pricing increases obtained. Revenue from our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment increased $2,296,000 or 5% to $51,900,000 for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $49,604,000 for fiscal 2017. The increased revenue for our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to an increase in sales volume and prices totaling $2,853,000 in our pipeline coatings products, with both our U.K.-produced water and wastewater pipeline products and U.S.-produced oil and gas pipeline products achieving increases over the prior year. Our bridge and highway products achieved a year-over-year increase in sales totaling $145,000, on both volume and price, compared to fiscal 2017, with large bridge infrastructure work in the eastern U.S. continuing in fiscal 2018. Partially countering the overall increase in revenue for the segment in fiscal 2018 were: (a) a $629,000 decrease in our building envelope product sales, driven predominantly by a decrease in sales volume; and (b) coating and lining systems products, which had a net revenue decrease of $73,000 on decreased sales volume offsetting increased sales prices.\nCost of Products and Services Sold\nCost of products and services sold increased $5,027,000 or 3% to $180,163,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $175,136,000 in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold increased to 64% in fiscal 2019 compared to 62% for fiscal 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the relative percentages of cost of products and services sold to revenue for our three operating segments:\n\nCost of products and services sold in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment was $60,345,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $53,324,000 in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment increased to 58% for fiscal 2019 compared to 52% in fiscal 2018. Cost of products and services sold in our Industrial Tapes segment was $93,299,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $92,418,000 in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment increased to 72% in fiscal 2019 compared to 71% for fiscal 2018. Cost of products and services sold in our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment was $26,519,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $29,394,000 in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment was consistent at 57% in both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services overall increased primarily due to: (a) a less favorable sales mix, most specifically felt in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment, as our lower margin products constituted a comparatively higher portion of total sales; (b) increasing supply and demand imbalances and tariffs causing rising raw material costs; and (c) production inefficiencies and additional costs to maintain service levels in the first half of fiscal 2019 at our Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC locations following the consolidation of our Pawtucket, RI operations. We purchase a wide variety of commodity items, including petroleum-based solvents, films, yarns, polymers and nonwovens, along with base metals (aluminum and copper), as well as many other substrates. To facilitate control of our margins, we closely monitor the pricing of our commodities-based raw materials across all product lines, as their price volatility can have short- and long-term effects on both our customers' demand for our products and the margins at which we are able to sell them.\nCost of products and services sold in our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment was $53,324,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $37,190,000 in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment increased to 52% for fiscal 2018 compared to 47% in fiscal 2017. Cost of products and services sold in our Industrial Tapes segment was $92,418,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $81,919,000 in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment increased to 71% for fiscal 2018 compared to 66% in fiscal 2017. Cost of products and services sold in our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment was $29,394,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $26,927,000 in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in this segment increased to 57% in fiscal 2018 compared to 54% for fiscal 2017. As a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold in the three segments increased primarily due to: (a) the effects of international and domestic trade policy on raw material costs, which most acutely rose in the latter half of fiscal 2018; (b) the rising costs of petroleum-based inputs; (c) an unfavorable product mix, most prominently in our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment, as our lower margin products constituted a comparatively higher portion of total sales in fiscal year 2018; and (d) in the case of our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment the inclusion of $1,070,000 in cost of sale of inventory step-up, related to inventory purchased as part of our fiscal 2018 second quarter acquisition of Zappa Stewart.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $1,085,000 or 2% to $52,728,000 during fiscal 2019 compared to $51,643,000 in fiscal 2018. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 19% of total revenue in fiscal 2019 compared to 18% for fiscal 2018. The year-over-year increase in expenses is primarily attributable to: (a) increased amortization expense of $638,000, primarily related to intangible assets acquired in our December 31, 2017 acquisition of Zappa Stewart; (b) increased selling and commission expense of $252,000, principally related to sales growth on our highest commissionable products in the current year, coupled with the addition of a full year of the established sales force of Zappa Stewart; and (c) increased research and development costs of $81,000, after the addition of the established research and development department within Zappa Stewart during the second quarter of the prior year. The Company continues to closely monitor spend with an emphasis on controlling costs and leveraging existing resources.\nDuring fiscal 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4,972,000 or 11% to $51,643,000 compared to $46,671,000 in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses stayed consistent at 18% of total revenue in both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017. The year-over-year increase in expenses is primarily attributable to: (a) increased amortization expense of $2,680,000, primarily related to intangible assets acquired in our December 31, 2017 acquisition of Zappa Stewart, and a full twelve months of amortization related to our September 30, 2016 acquisition of certain assets of Resin Designs; (b) increased selling and commission expense of $773,000, principally related to sales growth on our highest commissionable products in fiscal year 2018, coupled with the addition of the established sales force of Zappa Stewart and a full twelve months of the established sales force of Resin Designs; and (c) increased research and development expense of $244,000, principally related to fiscal year 2018 addition of the established research and development department of Zappa Stewart and a full twelve months of operation of the established research and development department of Resin Designs.\nLoss on Impairment of Goodwill\nDuring the three-month period ended February 28, 2019 (the second fiscal quarter of 2019), the ordering patterns of our polyurethane dispersions reporting unit's customers, especially those in the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in the reporting unit's backlog of customer orders believed to be firm as of February 28, 2019, indicated that an impairment in the carrying value of the reporting unit might have occurred. As such, we performed an impairment test on our indefinite-lived and long-lived assets related to our polyurethane dispersions reporting unit, now part of the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives operating segment (part of the former Industrial Materials segment during the second fiscal quarter of 2019), in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d and ASC Topic 360, Disclosure - Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\u201d As a result of impairment testing, which included first testing long-lived assets other than goodwill for impairment under applicable guidance, the Company recorded a charge of $2,410,000 to loss on impairment of goodwill within the consolidated statement of operations during the quarter ended February 28, 2019.\nOperations Optimization Costs\nDuring the second half of fiscal 2019, Chase began moving the pulling and detection operations housed in its Granite Falls, NC location to its Hickory, NC facility. This is in line with the Company's ongoing initiative to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its processes. Currently, the pulling and detection operations are the only Chase-owned production operations in Granite Falls, NC, with the remaining portions of the building being either utilized for research and development or leased to a third party. The process of moving has continued subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and is anticipated to be completed during the first half of fiscal 2020. The Company recognized $526,000 in expense related to the move in fiscal 2019. Future costs related to this move are currently anticipated to be approximately $700,000, and the Company plans to disclose these amounts separately on the Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, Chase commissioned engineering studies of certain legacy operations, machinery and locations related to the Company's ongoing facility rationalization and consolidation initiative. Chase is currently reviewing the data and recommendations provided by the study and may further utilize third party engineering, IT and other professional services firms in the future for similar optimization-related work. The Company recognized $200,000 in expense related to these services in fiscal 2019; but given the ongoing nature of the review, an estimate of future costs cannot currently be determined.\nOn June 25, 2018, the Company announced to its employees the planned closing of its Pawtucket, RI manufacturing facility effective August 31, 2018. This was in line with the Company's ongoing efforts to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its processes. The manufacture of products previously produced in the Pawtucket, RI facility was substantially moved to existing Company facilities in Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC during a two-month transition period, with certain additional expenditures recognized in the first fiscal quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, $1,272,000 was expensed related to the closure, including: (a) cash-related employee-related, logistics and uncapitalized facilities improvement costs of $590,000; and (b) non-cash-related accelerated depreciation expense of $682,000. The Company expensed $260,000 in the three-month period ended November 30, 2018 related to the move, with no additional expense recognized in fiscal 2019. Future costs related to this move are not anticipated to be significant to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized $70,000 and $935,000, respectively, in expenses to raze its Randolph, MA facility, which had been idle regarding production for several years. No expense related to this project was recognized in fiscal 2018 or 2019. The Company began marketing the site for sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The Company substantially completed the demolition of the structure in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, and completed other environmental aspects of the project during fiscal 2017. The sale of the property is anticipated to follow in a subsequent period, and any future expenses related to the project are not anticipated to be material.\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nIn fiscal 2018, the Company incurred $393,000 of costs related to our acquisition of Zappa Stewart. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and all related professional service fees (including banking, legal, accounting and actuarial fees) were expensed as incurred within the second fiscal quarter of 2018.\nIn fiscal 2017, the Company incurred $584,000 of costs related to our acquisition of certain assets of Resin Designs. This acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and all related professional service fees (including banking, legal, accounting, and actuarial fees) were expensed as incurred during the year ended August 31, 2017.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $653,000 or 56% to $519,000 in fiscal 2019 compared to $1,172,000 in fiscal 2018. Interest expense increased $333,000 or 40% to $1,172,000 in fiscal 2018 compared to $839,000 in fiscal 2017. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2019 is the result of the decreased average outstanding balance of Chase's revolving debt facility, following the $65,000,000 draw on the facility in December 2017 to substantially fund the Company's acquisition of Zappa Stewart and subsequent incremental principal payments made.\nIn fiscal 2018, subsequent to the December 2017 borrowing, the Company made $40,000,000 in payments against the principal. In fiscal 2019, Chase made an additional $25,000,000 in principal payments, paying off the outstanding balance in full as of August 31, 2019.\nGain on Sale of Real Estate\nIn November 2016, the Company finalized the sale of its Paterson, NJ property for proceeds of $1,382,000. This transaction resulted in a gain of $792,000 which was recorded during the year ended August 31, 2017.\nIn October 2016, Chase entered an agreement to sell its former corporate headquarters and executive offices in Bridgewater, MA. In December 2016, the sale was finalized for gross proceeds of $740,000, resulting in a gain on sale of $68,000 recognized during the year ended August 31, 2017.\nGain on Sale of License\nIn November 2017, the Company entered an agreement with an unrelated party to sell a license, including certain intellectual property, and sell certain construction in process assets, both related to the manufacturing of certain structural composite materials. In the second fiscal quarter of 2018, the transaction was finalized for gross consideration of $1,111,000 comprising cash proceeds of $1,000,000 and foreign tax consideration paid by the purchaser on Chase's behalf of $111,000. This transaction resulted in a gain of $1,085,000, which was recorded as a gain on sale of license during the fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2018.\nIn relation to this license agreement, the purchaser also entered into a royalty agreement with the Company. The purchaser will make royalty payments to Chase based on the volume of future sales of certain structural composite material manufactured by the purchaser. Revenue recognized related to this royalty agreement was not material in fiscal 2019 or 2018, and this royalty agreement was terminated in fiscal 2019.\nGain on Sale of Businesses\nOn April 20, 2018, Chase finalized an agreement with an unrelated party to sell all inventory, operational machinery and equipment and intangible assets of the Company's structural composites rod business, as well as a license related to the production and sale of rod, for proceeds of $2,232,000, net of transaction costs and following certain working capital adjustments. This business, which was part of the structural composites product line within the Industrial Tapes segment, had limited growth and profitability prospects as part of the Company, and was outside the areas Chase has identified for strategic emphasis. The resulting pre-tax gain on sale of $1,480,000 was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as a gain on sale of businesses within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Chase received $2,075,000, net of transaction costs, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, with the remaining $157,000 received in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as a result of a working capital true-up. Chase will provide certain transitional manufacturing and administrative support to the purchaser for which the Company will receive additional consideration upon the performance of services.\nIn relation to this transaction, the purchaser entered into a royalty agreement with the Company. The purchaser will make royalty payments to Chase based on future sales of certain structural composite material manufactured by the purchaser. Royalty revenue recognized in 2019 and 2018 related to this agreement was not material.\nOn April 3, 2017, Chase executed an agreement with an unrelated party to sell all inventory, machinery and equipment and intangible assets of its fiber optic cable components product line for proceeds of $3,858,000, net of transaction costs and following all working capital adjustments. The fiber optic cable components product line had been a part of our Industrial Tapes segment. Given its low-growth and low-margin prospects, and a customer, supplier and equipment base separate from our other businesses, the product line was determined to not be part of Chase's long-term strategy. The resulting pre-tax gain on sale of $2,013,000 was recognized during the year ended August 31, 2017. Further, the purchaser entered a multiyear lease for a portion of the manufacturing space at the Company's Granite Falls, NC facility. Chase will provide certain transitional manufacturing and administrative support to the purchaser for which the Company will receive additional consideration upon the performance of services.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther expense was $992,000 in fiscal 2019 compared to other expense of $172,000 in fiscal 2018, an increase of $820,000. Other income (expense) primarily includes foreign exchange gains (losses) caused by changes in exchange rates on transactions or balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, non-service cost components of periodic pension expense (including pension-related settlement costs due to the timing of lump-sum distributions), interest income, rental income and other non-trade/non-royalty/non-commission receipts. The increase in total other expense in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was largely due to the recognition of $511,000 in pension-related settlement costs in fiscal 2019, while no such expense was recognized in fiscal 2018.\nOther expense was $172,000 in fiscal 2018 compared to other expense of $341,000 in fiscal 2017, a decrease of $169,000. The decrease in total other expense in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was largely due to the lower non-service cost component of periodic pension expense recognized in fiscal 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 24.9% as compared to 24.3% and 31.0% in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe current and prior years' effective tax rates were most prominently affected by the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) in December 2017 and discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, recognized in relation to the Company's early adoption of ASU 2016-09 and described in more detail below. For fiscal 2019, the Company utilized the new 21% Federal tax rate enacted by the Tax Act. During fiscal 2018, Chase utilized a blended rate of 25.7%, based on a combination of four months of operations under the old 35% corporate income tax rate, and eight months at the new 21% rate. During fiscal 2017, Chase utilized the old 35% corporate income tax rate for the entire period. Please see Note 7 - Income Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the effects of the Tax Act.\nThe Company early adopted ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\u201d, during the first fiscal quarter of 2017. During the fiscal years ended August 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $157,000, $1,921,000 and $1,917,000, respectively, within income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The current year decrease in the benefit resulted from a decrease in certain stock option exercise activity in fiscal 2019. The Company anticipates the potential for increased periodic volatility in future effective tax rates based on the continued application of ASU No. 2016-09.\nNet Income\nNet income in fiscal 2019 decreased $10,432,000 or 24% to $32,711,000 compared to $43,143,000 in fiscal 2018. The decrease in net income in 2019 was primarily due to: (a) a lower gross profit on sales; (b) a loss on impairment of goodwill; (c) increased amortization expense recognized in the current period and related to our December 2017 acquisition of Zappa Stewart; (d) nonrecurring gains on sales of both a business and a license in the prior year period; and (e) increased pension-related settlement costs due to the timing of lump-sum disbursements in the current year-to-date period.\nNet income in fiscal 2018 increased $1,129,000 or 3% to $43,143,000 compared to $42,014,000 in fiscal 2017. The increase in net income in 2018 was primarily due to: (a) increase in gross profit on sales, positively impacted by our second quarter of 2018 acquisition of Zappa Stewart, along with increased royalties and commissions revenue; (b) a gain on sale of license and a gain on sale of business, both related to the structural composites rod business; (c) the recognition of a lower Federal statutory tax rate; and (d) the excess tax benefit recognized related to our early adoption of ASU No. 2016-09. These gains were negatively impacted by increased amortization expense, as well as one-time acquisition-related and inventory step-up costs, recognized in fiscal 2018, related to our December 2017 acquisition of Zappa Stewart.\nOther Important Performance Measures\nWe believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are useful performance measures. They are used by our executive management team to measure operating performance, to allocate resources, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our Board of Directors and investors concerning our financial performance. The Company believes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are also useful to investors. EBITDA is useful in comparing the core operations of the business from period to period by removing the impact of the Company's capital structure (through interest expense), asset base (through depreciation and amortization) and tax rate, and in evaluating operating performance relative to others in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA allows for comparison to the Company's performance in prior periods without the effect of items that, by their nature, tend to obscure the Company's core operating results due to the potential variability across periods based on their timing, frequency and magnitude. Free Cash Flow provides a means for measuring the cash generated from operations that is available for mandatory obligations, including interest payments and debt repayment, and discretionary investment opportunities such as funding acquisitions, product and market development and paying dividends. As a result, management believes these metrics, which are commonly used by financial analysts and others in the industries in which the Company operates, enhance the ability of investors to analyze trends in the Company's business and evaluate the Company's performance relative to peer companies and the past performance of the Company itself. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nWe define EBITDA as net income before interest expense from borrowings, income tax expense, depreciation expense from fixed assets, and amortization expense from intangible assets. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding costs and (gains) losses related to our acquisitions and divestitures, costs of products sold related to inventory step-up to fair value, settlement (gains) losses resulting from lump-sum distributions to participants from our defined benefit plans, operations optimization costs, and other significant items. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nThe use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow has limitations and these performance measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, U.S. GAAP measures such as net income and net cash provided by operating activities. None of these measures should be interpreted as representing the residual cash flow of the Company available solely for discretionary expenditures or to invest in the growth of our business, since we may have certain non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from these measures, including scheduled principal and (in the case of Free Cash Flow) interest payments on outstanding debt. Our measurement of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n\n (a) Represents loss on impairment of goodwill related to the polyurethane dispersions business in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 \n (b) Represents pension-related settlement costs due to the timing of lump sum distributions \n (c) Represents costs to relocate certain production operations from Granite Falls, NC to Hickory, NC in the second half of fiscal 2019, expense related to engineering studies performed to assess potential future operational changes and further plant rationalization and consolidation, Pawtucket, RI facility closure costs recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and first quarter of fiscal 2019 (excluding accelerated depreciation expense recognized) and the Randolph, MA facility exit and demolition costs incurred in 2017 \n (d) Represents costs related to the December 2017 (fiscal 2018) acquisition of Zappa Stewart and the September 2016 (fiscal 2017) acquisition of certain assets of Resin Designs \n (e) Represents expenses related to inventory step-up in fair value related to the December 2017 (fiscal 2018) acquisition of Zappa Stewart and the September 2016 (fiscal 2017) acquisition of certain assets of Resin Designs \n (f) Represents gain on November 2016 sale of the Company's Paterson, NJ location, and December 2016 sale of the Company's former corporate headquarters in Bridgewater, MA \n (g) Represents fiscal 2018 second quarter gain on sale of a license related to the structural composites product line \n (h) Represents gain on sale of the structural composites rod business in April 2018 (fiscal 2018) and the fiber optic cable components product line in April 2017 (fiscal 2017) \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to Free Cash Flow for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe following table provides a summary of net cash used in investing activities and net cash (used in) provided by financing activities, presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n\nLiquidity and Sources of Capital\nOur cash balance increased $12,943,000 to $47,771,000 at August 31, 2019 from $34,828,000 at August 31, 2018. The increased cash balance was primarily attributable to cash from operations of $49,535,000, partially offset by: (a) $25,000,000 in principal debt pay down on debt incurred to acquire Zappa Stewart in the prior year; and (b) a cash dividend payment of $7,522,000. Of the above noted amounts, $17,235,000 and $28,521,000 were held outside the U.S. by Chase Corporation and our foreign subsidiaries as of August 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Given our cash position and borrowing capability in the United States and the potential for increased investment and acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions, prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (prior year), we did not have a history of repatriating a significant portion of our foreign cash. With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) in the second fiscal quarter of 2018, significant changes in the Internal Revenue Code were enacted, changing the U.S. taxable nature of previously unrepatriated foreign earnings. Following the passage of the Tax Act, the Company repatriated $10,499,000 in U.K. foreign earnings in fiscal 2018 and $17,230,000 in fiscal 2019. We do not currently take the position that undistributed foreign subsidiaries' earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. See Note 7 - Income Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further discussion of the effects of the Tax Act.\nOur cash balance decreased $12,526,000 to $34,828,000 at August 31, 2018 from $47,354,000 at August 31, 2017. The decreased cash balance was primarily attributable to: (a) the $73,469,000 acquisition of Zappa Stewart, partially offset by a $65,000,000 utilization of our all-revolving debt facility; (b) $40,000,000 in subsequent debt repayments; (c) a cash dividend payment of $7,497,000; and (d) $3,488,000 in purchases of machinery and equipment throughout fiscal 2018. The overall decrease was positively impacted by: (a) cash from operations of $46,071,000; (b) cash proceeds from the sale of our structural composites rod business of $2,232,000; and (c) cash proceeds from the sale of a license related to our structural composites business of $1,000,000.\nCash provided by operations was $49,535,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $46,071,000 in fiscal 2018. Cash provided by operations during fiscal 2019 was primarily due to operating income and decreased accounts receivable, which contracted on lower sales levels. Partially offsetting the overall increase of cash provided by operations were decreased payables.\nCash provided by operations was $46,071,000 for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $51,932,000 in fiscal 2017. Cash provided by operations during fiscal 2018 was primarily due to operating income and increased accounts payable, which rose on increased inventory balances. Partially offsetting the overall amount of cash provided by operations were increased inventory (as the Company made opportunistic purchases of non-perishable materials to take advantage of then current costs, which were believed to be lower than future costs), increased accounts receivable (following stronger fourth quarter sales in fiscal 2018) and decreases in accrued income taxes (as cash payments for taxes exceeded the amount of income tax expense recognized during the period).\nThe ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 6.0 as of August 31, 2019 compared to 4.4 as of August 31, 2018. The increase in our current ratio in fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to the Company's ability to increase cash and cash equivalents, while concurrently decreasing accounts payable during fiscal 2019.\nCash used in investing activities was $2,166,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $73,766,000 in fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019, cash used in investing activities was primarily due to cash spent on capital purchases of machinery and equipment, partially offset by the final escrow payment received by the Company for our April 2017 sale of the fiber optic cable components business.\nCash used in investing activities was $73,766,000 for the year ended August 31, 2018 compared to $25,102,000 in fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2018, cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of Zappa Stewart in December 2017 and our purchases of machinery and equipment throughout fiscal 2018. Partially offsetting these uses of cash were; (a) cash proceeds from the sale of our structural composites rod business; and (b) cash proceeds from the sale of a license related to our structural composites business of $1,000,000.\nCash used in financing activities was $33,450,000 for the year ended August 31, 2019 compared to $14,423,000 provided by financing activities in fiscal 2018 and $52,796,000 used in financing activities in fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, Chase repaid $25,000,000 and $40,000,000, respectively, on the $65,000,000 it borrowed on its revolving debt facility to substantially fund its purchase of Zappa Stewart in fiscal 2018. Chase also paid annual dividends of $7,522,000 and $7,497,000 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. During fiscal 2017, cash used in financing activities was primarily due to our annual dividend payment, payments made on the term debt used to finance our fiscal 2012 acquisition of NEPTCO and, after December 15, 2016, payments made on the Company's revolving credit facility, described in more detail below.\nOn November 13, 2019, we announced a cash dividend of $0.80 per share (totaling approximately $7,540,000) to shareholders of record on November 26, 2019 and payable on December 4, 2019.\nOn November 13, 2018, we announced a cash dividend of $0.80 per share (resulting in payment of $7,522,000) to shareholders of record on November 23, 2018 and payable on December 5, 2018.\nOn October 30, 2017, we announced a cash dividend of $0.80 per share (resulting in payment of $7,497,000) to shareholders of record on November 9, 2017 and payable on December 6, 2017.\nOn December 15, 2016, we entered an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with Bank of America, acting as administrative agent, and with participation from Citizens Bank and JPMorgan Chase Bank (collectively with Bank of America, the Lenders\u201d). The Credit Agreement is initially an all-revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of $150,000,000, which can be increased by an additional $50,000,000 at the request of the Company and the individual or collective option of any of the Lenders. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and require certain lender approval for acquisitions by us and our subsidiaries over a certain size. It also requires us to maintain certain financial ratios on a consolidated basis, including a consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of no more than 3.25 to 1.00, and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the facility) of at least 1.25 to 1.00. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of August 31, 2019. The applicable interest rate for the Credit Agreement is based on the effective LIBOR plus an additional amount in the range of 1.00% to 1.75%, depending on our consolidated net leverage ratio or, at our option, at the bank's base lending rate. At August 31, 2019, there was no outstanding principal balance, and as such, no applicable interest rate. The Credit Agreement was used to refinance our previously existing credit facility, which consisted of a $70,000,000 five-year term loan entered into in June 2012 in connection with our acquisition of NEPTCO, together with a $15,000,000 revolving line of credit, each bearing interest at LIBOR plus an additional amount in the range of 1.75% to 2.25%, depending on our leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement also provides for additional liquidity to finance potential acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes.\nWe have several on-going capital projects, as well as our facility rationalization and consolidation initiative, which are important to our long-term strategic goals. Further, machinery and equipment will be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in our other manufacturing plants.\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company announced it had begun moving the production of its pulling and detection products from its Granite Falls, NC location to its Hickory, NC location, with completion of the move expected to occur in the first half of fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2018, the Company announced the planned closing of its Pawtucket, RI manufacturing facility effective August 31, 2018. The manufacturing of products previously produced in the Pawtucket, RI facility was moved to Company facilities in Oxford, MA and Lenoir, NC. These actions are in line with the Company's ongoing efforts to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its processes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company commissioned engineering studies to assess potential future operational changes and further plant rationalization and consolidation. A total of all potential future costs arising from any further plant rationalization and consolidation cannot be estimated at this time.\nWe may acquire companies or other assets in future periods which are complementary to our business. We believe that our existing resources, including cash on hand and the Credit Agreement, together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings, will be sufficient to fund our cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing, if needed, will be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nTo the extent that interest rates increase in future periods, we will assess the impact of these higher interest rates on the financial and cash flow projections of our potential acquisitions.\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at August 31, 2019 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) We may be required to make payments related to our unrecognized tax benefits. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $2,324,000 as of August 31, 2019 have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Note 7 - Income Taxes\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. \n (2) This table does not include the expected payments for our obligations for pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. As of August 31, 2019, we had recognized an accrued benefit plan liability of $12,228,000 representing the unfunded obligations of the pension benefit plans. See Note 9 - Benefits and Pension Plans\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information, including expected pension benefit payments for the next 10 years. \nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor discussion of the newly issued accounting pronouncements see Recently Issued Accounting Standards\u201d and Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\u201d in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies. The SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and operating results, and requires management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are described below.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable balances based on a combination of factors. In cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer's ability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific allowance against amounts due to us is recorded, and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due, industry and geographic concentrations, the current business environment and our historical experience. If the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen, additional allowances may be required in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our future operating results.\nInventory\nWe value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held, forecasted demand and changes in technology. These assessments require management judgments and estimates, and valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory may be recorded based on these assessments. We estimate excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand, product transitions, and market conditions, and record adjustments to reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value. The failure to accurately forecast demand may lead to additional excess and obsolete inventory and future charges.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. We assess the fair value of assets, including intangible assets, using a variety of methods, and each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset, including a market participant's use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant. Assets recorded from the perspective of a market participant that are determined to not have economic use for us are expensed immediately. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a transaction to acquire a business are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets consist of goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, trademarks, and patents and property, plant, and equipment. Intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, excluding goodwill, are amortized over their estimated useful life. We review long-lived assets and all intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill is also reviewed at least annually for impairment. We perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year. In fiscal 2017, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2017-04 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Topics (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\u201d We assess goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit, is recorded. Fair values for reporting units are determined based on the income approach (discounted cash flow method).\nRevenue\nEffective September 1, 2018, the Company adopted accounting standard ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (ASC 606) using the modified retrospective method for contracts that were not completed as of August 31, 2018. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, whereby the cumulative impact of all prior periods is recorded in retained earnings or other impacted balance sheet line items upon adoption. The comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under ASC 605. The impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and statements of operations, equity and cash flows as of the adoption date as a result of applying ASC 606 have been reflected within those respective financial statements. The Company's accounting policy has been updated to align with ASC 606.\nThe adoption of ASC 606 represents a change in accounting principle that provides enhanced revenue recognition disclosures. The Company accounts for revenue from contracts with customers when: (a) there is approval and commitment from both parties; (b) the rights of the parties are identified; (c) payment terms are identified; (d) the contract has commercial substance; and (e) collectability of consideration is probable. Revenue is primarily derived from customer purchase orders, master sales agreements, and negotiated contracts, all of which represent contracts with customers. See Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our accounting for revenue.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. Our contingent income tax liabilities are estimated based on the methodology prescribed in the guidance for accounting for uncertain tax positions. The guidance prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. Our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax-related exposures and settlements. Our assessment is based on our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities, as well as by current income tax trends. If circumstances change, we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for more information on our accounting for uncertain tax positions.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nWe evaluate the need for a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure compensation cost for share-based compensation at fair value and recognize the expense over the period that the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the vesting period. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options. This model requires significant estimates related to the award's expected life and future stock price volatility of the underlying equity security. Historically, in determining the amount of expense to be recorded, we were required to estimate forfeiture rates for awards, based on the probability that employees will complete the required service period. We estimated the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. In fiscal 2017, we early adopted ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\u201d Following the adoption of the new standard, the Company has elected to account for forfeitures as they occur.\nPension Benefits\nWe sponsor a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan covering employees of certain divisions of the Company. In calculating our retirement plan obligations and related expense, we make various assumptions and estimates. These assumptions include discount rates, benefits earned, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension obligations and future expense.\nEffective December 1, 2008, the Chase defined benefit pension plan was amended to include a soft freeze\u201d whereby any employee hired after the effective date of December 1, 2008 will not be admitted to the plan. The only exception related to employees who are members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union whose contract was amended to include a soft freeze whereby any employees hired after the effective date of July 15, 2012 will not be admitted to the plan. All eligible participants who were previously admitted to the plan prior to the applicable soft freeze dates will continue to accrue benefits as detailed in the plan agreements.\nThrough our wholly-owned subsidiary NEPTCO, we have another defined benefit pension plan which covered substantially all of our union employees at our Pawtucket, RI plant. This plan was frozen effective October 31, 2006, and as a result, no new participants can enter the plan and the benefits of current participants were frozen as of that date. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee's average compensation during the earlier of five years before retirement, or October 31, 2006. In August 2019, the Board of Directors voted to terminate the NEPTCO defined benefit plan. The Company has established that November 15, 2019 will serve as the plan termination date and is currently performing the administrative actions required to carry out the termination.\nWe account for our pension plans following the requirements of ASC Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits\u201d ( ASC 715\u201d). ASC 715 requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the funded status of a benefit plan; (b) measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employer's fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs pursuant to prior existing guidance.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation has not had a significant long-term impact on our earnings. In the event of significant inflation, our efforts to recover cost increases would be hampered as a result of the competitive nature of the industries in which we operate.", "item_7_tables": "Table
