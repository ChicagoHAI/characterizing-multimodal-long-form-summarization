In the Education segment, revenues increased by $25.0 million on higher sales in several business lines, particularly Grab and Go and summer reading packs, instructional programs, and literacy partnerships as well as in the segment's teaching resources and digital subscription product categories. The decrease in local currency revenues in the International segment of $18.0 million was primarily due to lower book fairs channel revenues in Canada and the UK, coupled with a decrease in direct-to-home sales in Asia, and were largely offset by a favorable impact of foreign exchange of $16.9 million. Loss per diluted share was $0.32 for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to $1.27 in the prior fiscal year.\nOperating loss in fiscal 2021 was $22.7 million compared to $88.5 million in the prior fiscal year, representing an improvement of $65.8 million. The improvement year-over-year was directly attributable to the cost-saving initiatives implemented by the Company during fiscal 2021, which helped to mitigate the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's end markets and supply chain, coupled with the absence of the $40.0 million write down of inventory that occurred in fiscal 2020. The cost savings were partially offset by a mediation-assisted settlement of $20.0 million regarding certain licenses and trademarks related to intellectual property used in formerly owned products, exclusive of potential insurance recoveries. In addition, the Company recognized asset impairments of $11.1 million in fiscal 2021 related to the Company's plan to cease use of its leased office space in New York City and consolidate into the company-owned New York headquarters building and permanently close 13 of its 54 U.S. book fairs warehouses as part of a branch consolidation project. The Company also incurred higher severance costs of $10.0 million associated with an effort to align the Company's workforce size with COVID-impacted business volumes.\nFiscal 2021 results were significantly impacted by the pandemic as a large percentage of schools were operating in a remote or hybrid mode as a result of COVID-19 concerns and restrictions. However, the Company showed improved results in revenue and operating income during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, even as educators around the globe struggled with transitioning their students safely back to the classroom. While executing on the cost-saving program, the Company continued to make investments related to its key growth initiatives with a focus on book fairs recovery, new education solutions, including digital products and early childhood programs, increasing parent access to the Company's eCommerce platforms, English language learning in Asia, the acquisition and development of content for its trade and media operations, as well as continued technology investments to improve systems and processes, all of which are the foundation of the Company's growth strategy in fiscal 2022 and beyond.\nOutlook\nWhile uncertainty still remains with respect to COVID-19, the Company is beginning to see strengthening underlying trends across all businesses and school and trade markets, as students around the globe return to the classroom, educators look to dependable and effective ways for accelerating student achievement, and stores welcome shoppers without restrictions. The Company believes it is well-positioned to continue the growth patterns seen in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as markets recover, especially for the book fairs businesses in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., and expects stronger operating leverage and resulting cash flow given the successful reduction in labor and other operating costs from pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, the Company continues to identify further opportunities for incremental cost savings through process improvements and automation, consolidating functions, and increased utilization of the Company's international shared services resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral:\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements involves the use of estimates and assumptions by management, which affects the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current business factors, future expectations and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, all of which are necessary in order to form a basis for determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates the adequacy of its reserves and the estimates used in calculations, including, but not limited to: collectability of accounts receivable; variable consideration related to anticipated returns; allocation of transaction price to contractual performance obligations; amortization periods; stock-based compensation expense; pension and other postretirement obligations; tax rates; recoverability of inventories; deferred income taxes and tax reserves; the timing and amount of future income taxes and related deductions; recoverability of prepublication costs; royalty advance reserves; customer reward programs; and the impairment assessment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangibles. For a complete description of the Company's significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The following policies and account descriptions include all those identified by the Company as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations:\nRevenue Recognition:\nThe Company's revenue recognition policies for its principal businesses are as follows:\nSchool-Based Book Clubs - Revenue from school-based book clubs is recognized upon shipment of the products.\nSchool-Based Book Fairs - Revenues associated with school-based book fairs relate to the sale of children's books and other products to book fair sponsors. In addition, the Company employs an incentive program to encourage the sponsorship of book fairs and increase the number of fairs held each school year. The Company identifies two potential performance obligations within its school-based book fair contracts, which include the fulfillment of book fairs product and the fulfillment of product upon the redemption of incentive program credits by customers. The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognizes revenue at a point in time. The Company utilizes certain estimates based on historical experience, redemption patterns and future expectations related to the participation in the incentive program to determine the relative fair value of each performance obligation when allocating the transaction price. Changes in these estimates could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue. Revenue allocated to the book fairs product is recognized at the point at which product is delivered to the customer and control is transferred. The revenue allocated to the incentive program credits is recognized upon redemption of incentive credits and the transfer of control of the redeemed product. Incentive credits are generally redeemed within 12 months of issuance. Payment for school-based book fairs product is due at the completion of a customer's fair. Revenues associated with virtual fairs are recognized upon shipment of the products and related incentive program credits are expensed upon issuance.\nTrade - Revenue from the sale of children's books for distribution in the retail channel is primarily recognized when performance obligations are satisfied and control is transferred to the customer, or when the product is on sale and available to the public. For newly published titles, the Company, on occasion, contractually agrees with its customers when the publication may be first offered for sale to the public, or an agreed upon Strict Laydown Date.\" For such titles, the control of the product is not deemed to be transferred to the customer until such time that the publication can contractually be sold to the public, and the Company defers revenue on sales of such titles until such time the customer is permitted to sell the product to the public. Revenue for ebooks, which is generally the net amount received from the retailer, is recognized upon electronic delivery to the customer by the retailer. The sale of trade product generally includes a right of return.\nEducation - Revenue from the sale of educational materials is recognized upon shipment of the products, or upon acceptance of product by the customer, depending on individual contractual terms. Revenue from digital products is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription period. Revenue from professional development services is recognized when the services have been provided to the customer. Revenue from contracts with multiple\ndeliverables are recognized as each performance obligation is satisfied in which the transaction price is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis.\nFilm Production and Licensing - Revenue from the sale of film rights, principally for the home video, streaming and domestic and foreign television markets, is deferred during production and recognized when the film or episodes have been delivered and are available for showing or exploitation. Licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with royalty agreements at the time the licensed materials are available to the licensee and collections are reasonably assured.\nMagazines - Revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription period, as the magazines are delivered.\nDirect Sales and Export - Revenue from the direct sales channel is recognized upon acceptance of the physical product by the customer.\nThe Company has elected to present sales and other related taxes on a net basis, excluded from revenues, and as such, these are included within Other accrued expenses until remitted to taxing authorities.\nAccounts receivable:\nAccounts receivable are recognized net of an allowance for credit losses. In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to customers that satisfy predefined credit criteria. The Company recognizes an allowance for credit losses on trade receivables that are expected to be incurred over the lifetime of the receivable. Reserves for estimated credit losses are established at the time of sale and are based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and supportable forecasts impacting its ultimate collectability, including specific reserves on a customer-by-customer basis, creditworthiness of the Company's customers and prior collection experience. At the time the Company determines that a receivable balance, or any portion thereof, is deemed to be permanently uncollectible, the balance is then written off. A one percentage point change in the estimated bad debt reserve rates, which are applied to the accounts receivable aging, would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $2.2 million and approximately $2.8 million, respectively.\nEstimated returns:\nFor sales that include a right of return, the Company will estimate the transaction price and record revenues as variable consideration based on the amounts the Company expects to ultimately be entitled. In order to determine estimated returns, the Company utilizes historical return rates, sales patterns, types of products and expectations and recognizes a corresponding reduction to Revenues and Cost of goods sold. Management also considers patterns of sales and returns in the months preceding the fiscal year, as well as actual returns received subsequent to the fiscal year, available customer and market specific data and other return rate information that management believes is relevant. In addition, a refund liability is recorded within Other accrued expenses for the consideration to which the Company believes it will not ultimately be entitled and a return asset is recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the expected inventory to be returned. Actual returns could differ from the Company's estimate. A one percentage point change in the estimated reserve for returns rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $3.1 million.\nInventories:\nInventories, consisting principally of books, are stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value. The Company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based upon a calculation using the expected future sales of existing inventory driven by estimates around forecasted purchases, inventory consumption costs, and the sell-through rate of current fiscal year purchases. In accordance with the Company's inventory retention policy, expected future sales of existing inventory are compared against historical usage by channel for reasonableness and any specifically identified excess or obsolete inventory, due to an anticipated lack of demand, will also be reserved. The impact of a one percentage point change in the obsolescence reserve rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $3.6 million.\nLong-lived assets:\nLong-lived assets, including operating lease right-of-use assets, property, plant, and equipment, prepublication costs and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable. For the purposes of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. If impairment indicators are present, the Company performs a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset to its carrying amount. If it is determined that a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset. The fair values determined by the Company require significant judgment and include certain assumptions regarding future sales and expenses, discount rates and real estate market conditions.\nRoyalty advances:\nRoyalty advances are initially capitalized and subsequently expensed as related revenues are earned or when the Company determines future recovery through earndowns is not probable. The Company has a long history of providing authors with royalty advances, and it tracks each advance earned with respect to the sale of the related publication. Historically, the longer the unearned portion of the advance remains outstanding, the less likely it is that the Company will recover the advance through the sale of the publication, as the related royalties earned are applied first against the remaining unearned portion of the advance. The Company applies this historical experience to its existing outstanding royalty advances to estimate the likelihood of recovery. Additionally, the Company's editorial staff regularly reviews its portfolio of royalty advances to determine if individual royalty advances are not recoverable through earndowns for discrete reasons, such as the death of an author prior to completion of a title or titles, a Company decision to not publish a title, poor market demand or other relevant factors that could impact recoverability.\nGoodwill and intangible assets:\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized and are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.\nWith regard to goodwill, the Company compares the estimated fair values of its identified reporting units to the carrying values of their net assets. The Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its identified reporting units are less than their carrying values. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company measures goodwill impairment by the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit. For each of the reporting units, the estimated fair value is determined utilizing the expected present value of the projected future cash flows of the reporting unit, in addition to comparisons to similar companies. The Company reviews its definition of reporting units annually or more frequently if conditions indicate that the reporting units may change. The Company evaluates its operating segments to determine if there are components one level below the operating segment level. A component is present if discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of the business. If an operating segment only contains a single component, that component is determined to be a reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. If an operating segment contains multiple components, the Company evaluates the economic characteristics of these components. Any components within an operating segment that share similar economic characteristics are aggregated and deemed to be a reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. Components within the same operating segment that do not share similar economic characteristics are deemed to be individual reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes.\nThe Company has seven reporting units with goodwill subject to impairment testing. The determination of the fair value of the Company's reporting units involves a number of assumptions, including the estimates of future cash flows, discount rates and market-based multiples, among others, each of which is subject to change. Accordingly, it is possible that changes in assumptions and the performance of certain reporting units could lead to impairments in future periods, which may be material.\nWith regard to other intangibles with indefinite lives, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the identified asset is less than its carrying value. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs a quantitative test. The estimated fair value is determined utilizing the expected present value of the projected future cash flows of the asset.\nIntangible assets with definite lives consist principally of tradenames, customer lists, intellectual property and other agreements and are amortized over their expected useful lives. Customer lists are amortized on a straight-line basis over five to ten years, while other agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life. Intellectual property assets are amortized over their remaining useful lives, which is approximately five years.\nEmployee Benefit Plan Obligations:\nThe rate assumptions discussed below impact the Company's calculations of its UK pension and U.S. postretirement obligations. The rates applied by the Company are based on the UK pension plan asset portfolio's past average rates of return, discount rates and actuarial information. Any change in market performance, interest rate performance, assumed health care cost trend rate and compensation rates could result in significant changes in the Company's UK pension plan and U.S. postretirement obligations.\nPension obligations\nThe Company's UK Pension Plan calculations are based on three primary actuarial assumptions: the discount rate, the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of compensation increases. The discount rate is used in the measurement of the projected, accumulated and vested benefit obligations and interest cost component of net periodic pension costs. The long-term expected return on plan assets is used to calculate the expected earnings from the investment or reinvestment of plan assets. The anticipated rate of compensation increase is used to estimate the increase in compensation for participants of the plan from their current age to their assumed retirement age. The estimated compensation amounts are used to determine the benefit obligations. A one percentage point change in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $0.3 million and approximately $0.8 million, respectively. A one percentage point change in the expected long-term return on plan assets would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $0.4 million.\nOther Postretirement benefits\nThe Company provides postretirement benefits, consisting of healthcare and life insurance benefits, to eligible retired United States-based employees. The postretirement medical plan benefits are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, with the employee paying a portion of the premium and the Company paying the remainder. The existing benefit obligation is based on the discount rate and the assumed health care cost trend rate. The discount rate is used in the measurement of the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and the interest cost component of net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The assumed health care cost trend rate is used in the measurement of the long-term expected increase in medical claims. A one percentage point change in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $0.1 million.\nEquity Awards:\nStock-based compensation - The Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company recognizes the cost, based on the award's fair value at the date of grant, on a straight-line basis over an award's requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, except for the grants to retirement-eligible employees. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model requires management to make significant judgments and estimates. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the option-pricing model could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of option grants and the related expense. The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury rate in effect on the date of grant with a term equal to the expected life. The expected term is determined based on historical employee exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected dividend yield is based on actual dividends paid or to be paid by the Company. The volatility is estimated based on historical volatility corresponding to the expected life. The fair value of restricted stock units are assumed to be the per share market price of the Company's stock as of the date of grant.\nTaxes:\nIncome Taxes - The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, for purposes of determining taxable income, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on\ndifferences between financial reporting and tax basis of such assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be realized.\nThe Company believes that its taxable earnings, during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized, should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of the tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, the Company establishes a valuation allowance.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of on-going tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carryforwards, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to adjust the valuation allowance.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step method. Recognition occurs when an entity concludes that a tax position, based solely on technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. If a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, the amount recognized is the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. The Company assesses all income tax positions and adjusts its reserves against these positions periodically based upon these criteria. The Company also assesses potential penalties and interest associated with these tax positions, and includes these amounts as a component of income tax expense.\nThe Company assesses foreign investment levels periodically to determine if all or a portion of the Company's investments in foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely invested. Any required adjustment to the income tax provision would be reflected in the period that the Company changes this assessment. The Company elects to recognize the tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) earned by foreign subsidiaries as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred.\nNon-income Taxes - The Company is subject to tax examinations for sales-based taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing and, in certain cases, have resulted in assessments from taxing authorities. Where a sales tax liability with respect to a jurisdiction is probable and can be reliably estimated, the Company has made accruals for these matters and these amounts are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Future developments relating to the foregoing could result in adjustments being made to these accruals.\nResults of Operations\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

2021, the Company recognized a pretax mediation-assisted settlement of $20.0 regarding certain licenses and trademarks related to intellectual property used in formerly owned products and pretax branch consolidation and other business rationalization costs of $7.5.

A detailed discussion of the Company's fiscal year 2019 results and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal years 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for the year ended May 31, 2020, filed with the Company's Form 10-K dated July 24, 2020.\nRevenues from operations for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 decreased by $186.8 million, or 12.6%, to $1,300.3 million, compared to $1,487.1 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in revenues was due to lower Children's Book Publishing and Distribution segment revenues of $210.7 million and lower International segment revenues of $1.1 million, partially offset by increased revenues in the Education segment of $25.0 million. Within the Children's Book Publishing and Distribution segment, book fairs channel revenues decreased $219.5 million due to significantly lower in-person fair count as schools were not hosting fairs on-site due to COVID-19, coupled with lower book clubs channel revenues of $11.7 million due, in part, to decreased sponsorship as schools were operating in a remote or hybrid mode due to COVID-19. Lower revenues were partially offset by increased revenues from the trade channel of $20.5 million, driven by the release of a number of best-selling frontlist titles combined with higher backlist sales from best-selling series. Within the Education segment, increased revenues were driven by higher sales in several business lines, particularly Grab and Go and summer reading packs, instructional programs, and literacy partnerships, as well as in the segment's teaching resources and digital subscription product categories. Local currency revenues in the International segment decreased $18.0 million, primarily driven by lower book fairs channel revenues in Canada and the UK for a combined $26.1 million decrease and lower direct-to-home sales in Asia, partially offset by increased revenues in the trade channel across all international markets. The International segment revenues were also impacted by favorable foreign currency exchange of $16.9 million.\nComponents of Cost of goods sold for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ amounts in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td>% of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>% of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product, service and production costs </td> <td>$ </td> <td>352.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>27.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>411.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>27.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty costs </td> <td> </td> <td>121.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepublication and production amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>26.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Postage, freight, shipping, fulfillment and all other costs </td> <td> </td> <td>165.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>193.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of goods sold </td> <td>$ </td> <td>666.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>51.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>751.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>50.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was 51.3%, compared to 50.5% in the prior fiscal year. The increase in Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by the sales decline in the book fairs channel, which traditionally has a higher mix of non-royalty bearing titles, coupled with higher trade sales, which typically have a higher royalty rate. In addition, the Company recognized higher inventory reserves in the book fairs channel due to the COVID-19 related sales decline, offset by lower inventory reserves in the book clubs and trade channels as a result of improved inventory management.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 were $584.9 million, compared to $722.5 million in the prior fiscal year. The $137.6 million decrease was driven by the Company's COVID-related cost-saving program, which included temporary employee furlough and reduced work week programs, the majority of which were discontinued at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, a more permanent restructuring initiative resulting in lower employee-related expenses, improvements in operating and financial processes, and other efforts to lower the Company's overall cost base. The Company also benefited from the participation in government subsidy programs resulting in subsidies of $11.2 million internationally and $8.6 million domestically. A substantial portion of the cost-saving program, excluding the employee furlough, reduced work week and government subsidy programs, is expected to bring permanent improvements to the Company's cost structure. The cost savings were partially offset by a mediation-assisted settlement of $20.0 million regarding certain licenses and trademarks related to intellectual property used in formerly owned products, exclusive of potential insurance recoveries, as well as higher severance expense, which increased to $23.5 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 from $17.2 million in the prior year period. Severance expense included a charge related to cost reduction and restructuring programs of $23.1 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $13.1 million in fiscal 2020. In addition, in fiscal 2021, the Company recognized restructuring\ncharges in the Philippines to scale back a non-profitable channel related the direct sales business of $4.2 million and branch consolidation costs of $3.3 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 were $60.5 million, which were relatively consistent to $61.5 million in the prior fiscal year. There were no significant changes to the assets in service in fiscal 2021.\nAsset impairments and write downs for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 were $11.1 million, compared to $40.6 million in the prior fiscal year. In fiscal 2021, the Company committed to a plan to cease use of its leased office space in New York City and consolidate into the company-owned New York headquarters and permanently close 13 of its 54 U.S. book fairs warehouses as part of a branch consolidation project. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment of the right-of-use assets associated with operating leases in the amount of $9.6 million and an impairment of $1.5 million of other long-lived assets, primarily leasehold improvements. The Company will continue to identify opportunities to consolidate distribution networks within the book fairs business. In fiscal 2020, changes were made to the Company's North American purchasing protocols, product offerings and inventory retention policies reducing the anticipated inventory requirements in the Company's school channels. As a result, the Company recorded a write down of inventory of $37.6 million and author advances and prepublication costs, related to the inventory, of $1.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively. In addition, in fiscal 2020, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $0.6 million related to an outdated technology platform in Canada.\nInterest income for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $0.4 million, compared to $3.1 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to lower U.S. interest rates on short-term investment balances. Interest expense for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $6.2 million, compared to $3.0 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to interest expense on increased debt borrowings.\nGain (loss) on sale of assets and other for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $10.4 million. The Company sold the company-owned facility located in Danbury, Connecticut and the UK distribution center located in Southam, recognizing a gain on sale of $6.6 million and $3.8 million, respectively.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was 40.1%, compared to 51.3% in the prior fiscal year. The lower benefit for income taxes when compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily driven by the rate differential on the prior fiscal year federal net operating loss carrybacks that did not repeat in the current fiscal year.\nNet loss for fiscal 2021 was $10.9 million compared to $43.7 million in fiscal 2020, an improvement of $32.8 million. The basic and diluted loss per share of Class A Stock and Common Stock was $0.32 in fiscal 2021, compared to $1.27 in fiscal 2020.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 was $0.1 million.\nResults of Operations - Segments\nCHILDREN'S BOOK PUBLISHING AND DISTRIBUTION\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ amounts in millions) </td> <td>2021 compared to 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ change </td> <td> </td> <td>% change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>664.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>875.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(210.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold </td> <td> </td> <td>344.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>430.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(86.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses * </td> <td> </td> <td>304.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>420.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(116.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairments and write downs </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Other operating expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses, bad debt expenses and depreciation and amortization.\nNM Not meaningful\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nRevenues for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 decreased by $210.7 million to $664.7 million, compared to $875.4 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in segment revenues is primarily driven by lower book fairs channel revenues of $219.5 million due to the significantly lower in-person fair count as schools were not able to host fairs on-\nsite due to COVID-19. Book clubs channel revenues decreased $11.7 million due to COVID-impacted delays in school reopenings coupled with a strategic reduction in certain offers and SKUs to enhance profitability. These revenue declines were partially offset by increased trade channel revenues of $20.5 million, driven by sales of current fiscal year releases including Dog Man: Grime and Punishment, Dog Man: Mothering Heights, The Ickabog\u00ae, Cat Kid Comic Club, The Baby-Sitters Club Graphic Novel #8: Logan Likes Mary Anne!, The Baby-Sitters Club Graphic Novel #9: Claudia and the New Girl, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: MinaLima Edition, and Wings of Fire, Book 14: The Dangerous Gift, increased backlist sales from best-selling series including Harry Potter\u00ae, Dog Man\u00ae, Hunger Games\u00ae, Captain Underpants\u00ae, The Bad GuysTM, Five Nights at Freddy's, Wings of Fire and The Baby-Sitters Club\u00ae GraphixTM, as well as increased sales of workbooks within the Scholastic Early Learners and BOB Books\u00ae lines and higher audio book sales. While there were strong sales of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel) in fiscal 2021, the prior fiscal year results benefited from higher sales of this title as the release occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nCost of goods sold for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $344.0 million, or 51.8% of revenues, compared to $430.9 million, or 49.2% of revenues, in the prior fiscal year. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by the sales decline in the book fairs channel which traditionally has a higher mix of non-royalty bearing titles, coupled with higher trade sales, which typically have a higher royalty rate. In addition, postage, freight and shipping costs as a percentage of revenues increased in the school-based channels due to higher volumes of direct ship-to-home and the payment of holiday surcharges as a result of industry-wide capacity constraints. The Company also recognized higher inventory reserves in the book fairs channel due to the COVID-19 related sales decline, offset by lower inventory reserves in the book clubs and trade channels as a result of improved inventory management.\nOther operating expenses were $304.4 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to $420.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The $116.5 million decrease was attributable to the cost-saving program, which included employee furlough and reduced work week programs in the first fiscal quarter as well as restructuring initiatives, resulting in a reduction in employee-related costs across all channels, a COVID-related governmental employee retention credit, lower book clubs kit costs and savings from the temporary closure of certain book fair distribution facilities. The decrease was partially offset by branch consolidation costs of $2.8 million within the book fairs channel.\nAsset impairments were $2.6 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021. The Company committed to a plan to permanently close 13 of its 54 book fairs warehouses in the U.S. as part of the branch consolidation project, resulting in the recognition of an impairment expense of $2.6 million, primarily related to the right-of-use assets associated with these warehouse operating leases. The Company intends to continue to identify opportunities to consolidate distribution networks within the book fairs business.\nSegment operating income for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $13.7 million, compared to $23.6 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily driven by the significant decline in book fairs channel revenues and related restructuring activities within the book fairs operations which resulted in asset impairment charges and branch consolidation costs. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales in the trade channel and increased profitability in the book clubs channel due to lower kit costs, as well as a reduction in employee-related costs, primarily in the school-based channels, attributable to the cost-saving programs implemented by the Company.\nEDUCATION\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ amounts in millions) </td> <td>2021 compared to 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ change </td> <td> </td> <td>% change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>312.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>287.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold </td> <td> </td> <td>108.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses * </td> <td> </td> <td>143.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.4) </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>102.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin </td> <td> </td> <td>19.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Other operating expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses, bad debt expenses and depreciation and amortization.\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nRevenues for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 increased by $25.0 million to $312.3 million, compared to $287.3 million in the prior fiscal year. The Company is winding down the custom publishing magazine business, which resulted in a decrease of $10.0 million in revenues compared to the prior fiscal year period. Excluding custom\npublishing business revenues, segment revenues increased $35.0 million driven by higher sales of the Company's Grab and Go and summer reading packs to school districts and community-based organizations, as well as higher sales of summer instructional programs, as educators attempted to keep students engaged during the summer after remote and hybrid learning imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company anticipates federal stimulus funds to be utilized by schools during the 2021/2022 school year to help students accelerate their learning post-pandemic. Digital revenues increased $4.7 million in fiscal 2021 due to higher sales of digital subscription products, including Scholastic Literacy Pro\u00ae and BookFlix\u00ae, coupled with a large school district sale of Scholastic Literacy Pro and Scholastic F.I.R.S.T.\u00ae digital programs for independent reading and foundational reading skills. In addition, the Company's teaching resources business revenues increased $10.0 million from sales of jumbo workbooks and early readers, as parents turned to these resources to supplement remote and hybrid learning resulting from COVID-19. This increase was partially offset by lower sales of the Company's classroom magazines and traditional classroom book collections as many school districts remained closed for in-person learning.\nCost of goods sold for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $108.4 million, or 34.7% of revenue, compared to $100.7 million, or 35.1% of revenue, in the prior fiscal year. In fiscal 2021, favorable product mix from higher digital sales and sales of take-home reading packs, as well as lower employee costs associated with professional services revenue as services were delivered virtually rather than in person, were offset by higher inventory reserves as a result of a shortened selling season due to COVID-19.\nOther operating expenses were $143.3 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to $156.7 million in the prior fiscal year. The $13.4 million decrease was primarily related to a decrease in employee-related costs as a result of cost-saving measures implemented to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.\nSegment operating income for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $60.6 million, compared to $29.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The $30.7 million improvement was primarily driven by revenue increases in a number of the segment's business lines, including Grab and Go and summer reading packs, instructional programs, literacy partnerships, digital product subscriptions, and teaching resources products, coupled with cost-saving measures taken to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.\nINTERNATIONAL\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ amounts in millions) </td> <td>2021 compared to 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ change </td> <td> </td> <td>% change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>323.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>324.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.1) </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold </td> <td> </td> <td>173.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.1) </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses * </td> <td> </td> <td>126.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26.9) </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairments and write downs </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6) </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Other operating expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses, bad debt expenses and depreciation and amortization.\nNM Not meaningful\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nRevenues for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 decreased by $1.1 million to $323.3 million compared to $324.4 million in the prior fiscal year, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of $16.9 million. Total local currency revenues across the Company's foreign operations decreased $18.0 million when compared to the prior fiscal year. In Canada, local currency revenues decreased $11.9 million primarily driven by lower school-based channel sales as a result of COVID-19 restrictions, partially offset by increased sales of best-selling trade titles. In the UK, local currency revenues decreased $8.4 million primarily due to lower volumes in the book fairs channel due to COVID-related school closures, partially offset by increased book clubs sales from parent-to-home orders, as well as increased sales of trade titles. In Asia, local currency revenues decreased $5.4 million primarily related to lower revenues from the direct sales channel and lower school-based channel revenues, primarily due to the adverse impact of COVID-19, partially offset by increased sales in the trade channel. In Australia and New Zealand, local currency revenues increased $5.5 million, primarily on higher revenue from the trade and book clubs channels, partially offset by lower volumes in the book fairs channel in Australia. In addition, revenues from foreign rights increased $3.4 million while the export channel revenues decreased $1.2 million as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nCost of goods sold for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $173.2 million, or 53.6% of revenues, compared to $177.3 million, or 54.7% of revenues. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues was due to lower fulfillment costs in the book fairs channel due to revenue declines, partially offset by higher royalty costs due to a sales shift to trade titles with higher royalty rates.\nOther operating expenses were $126.1 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to $153.0 million in the prior fiscal year. In local currencies, Other operating expenses decreased by $33.2 million primarily driven by lower employee-related expenses as a result of the cost-saving programs implemented by the Company and COVID-related governmental subsidy programs in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the UK which resulted in subsidies of $11.2 million in fiscal 2021. In addition, the Company recognized higher income from equity investments in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year. The decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by restructuring charges in the Philippines to scale back a non-profitable channel related the direct sales business of $4.2 million in fiscal 2021 and higher one-time severance expense which increased by $1.5 million to $2.6 million compared to $1.1 million in the prior fiscal year. Other operating expenses were also impacted by favorable foreign currency exchange of $6.3 million.\nThere were no asset impairments during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021. Asset impairments were $0.6 million in fiscal 2020 due to an impairment charge related to an outdated technology platform in Canada.\nSegment operating income for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $24.0 million, compared to operating loss of $6.5 million in the prior fiscal year. Total local currency operating results across the Company's foreign operations improved $30.1 million, primarily driven by COVID-related governmental employee retention programs and lower employee-related costs as a result of cost-saving measures, in addition to increased trade channel revenues and higher equity investment income, partially offset by lower revenues in the book fairs and direct sales channels as well as increased severance expense and business rationalization costs.\nOverhead\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nUnallocated overhead expense for fiscal 2021 decreased by $14.5 million to $121.0 million, compared to $135.5 million in the prior fiscal year. A substantial portion of the decrease is related to charges in the prior fiscal year period that did not reoccur in the current fiscal year period including the $40.0 million write down of inventory, a $1.5 million settlement charge related to an alleged patent infringement and a $1.0 million settlement arising from an intellectual property producing agreement. Also contributing to the decrease in costs were lower employee-related costs resulting from lower headcount from restructuring activities and a COVID-related governmental employee retention credit, and an overall reduction in spending including medical, outside services and consultants, travel, and supplies. This decrease was partially offset by one-time charges in the current fiscal year including a mediation-assisted settlement of $20.0 million regarding certain licenses and trademarks related to intellectual property used in formerly owned products, exclusive of potential insurance recoveries, an $8.5 million asset impairment related to the leased office space in New York City in connection with the consolidation into the company-owned New York headquarters and higher severance expense related to the cost-saving programs, which increased by $8.5 million to $20.5 million, compared to $12.0 million in the prior fiscal year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nCash provided by operating activities was $71.0 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $2.1 million for the prior fiscal year, representing an increase in cash provided by operating activities of $68.9 million. Despite lower revenues in fiscal 2021, the Company's cost-savings initiatives continued to drive an overall reduction in spending including employee-related costs, medical, outside services and consultants, travel, and supplies, as well as lower income tax payments in the U.S. The Company intends to continue to limit certain spending in view of the economic uncertainty brought on by the global pandemic, however, savings related to certain employee-related costs are not expected to continue into fiscal 2022.\nCash used in investing activities was $50.5 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to cash used in investing activities of $95.7 million for the prior fiscal year, representing a decrease in cash used in investing activities of $45.2 million. The decrease in cash used was primarily driven by the net proceeds from the sale of the Danbury facility and the Southam distribution center of $12.3 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The Company also had lower capital expenditures of $15.5 million as it continued to make strategic investments in key growth areas of the\nbusiness and technology, both internal and customer-facing, to allow it to operate with greater efficiency, and lower prepublication spending of $7.8 million. Additionally, in the prior year, the Company acquired land in the UK as part of a warehouse consolidation project and made other acquisition-related payments, both of which did not reoccur in the current fiscal year.\nCash used by financing activities was $52.3 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to cash provided in financing activities of $154.1 million for the prior fiscal year. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities of $206.4 million was primarily driven by the $200.0 million borrowing under the U.S. loan agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, with no additional borrowings made in fiscal 2021. The decrease was also attributable to a repayment of borrowings under the U.S. loan agreement of $25.0 million and lower short-term credit facility net borrowings of $12.4 million in fiscal 2021. This decrease was partially offset by the temporary suspension of the Company's share buy back program pursuant to which $35.5 million of common stock was reacquired in the prior fiscal year.\nCash Position\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $366.5 million at May 31, 2021 and $393.8 million at May 31, 2020. Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's U.S. operations totaled $318.0 million at May 31, 2021 and $364.2 million at May 31, 2020.\nDue to the seasonal nature of its business as discussed under Seasonality\u201d above, the Company usually experiences negative cash flows in the June through October time period. As a result of the Company's business cycle, borrowings have historically increased during June, July and August, have generally peaked in September or October, and have been at their lowest point in May. As a precautionary measure in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company accessed its committed bank credit facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 by taking a U.S. dollar LIBOR-based advance for $200.0 million, although there continues to be no immediate working capital requirement. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company paid down $25.0 million of the borrowing, resulting in $175.0 million outstanding as of May 31, 2021, which is classified as current effective as of the third quarter of fiscal 2021. On December 16, 2020, the U.S. loan agreement was amended, which, among other things, included adjustments to certain covenant thresholds and reduced the borrowing limit from $375.0 million to $250.0 million. See Note 5, \"Debt\" of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, \"Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for more information concerning the amended U.S. loan agreement. The Company intends to extend the current Loan Agreement, or enter into a new long-term bank credit facility, prior to its expiration on January 5, 2022.\nThe Company's operating philosophy is to use cash provided by operating activities to create value by paying down debt, reinvesting in existing businesses and, from time to time, making acquisitions that will complement its portfolio of businesses or acquiring other strategic assets, as well as engaging in shareholder enhancement initiatives, such as share repurchases or dividend declarations. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, there were no share repurchases as the Company's open-market buy-back program was, and continues to be, temporarily suspended in the face of COVID-19 uncertainties. Approximately $35.5 million of shares were repurchased in the prior fiscal year.\nThe Company has maintained, and expects to maintain for the foreseeable future, sufficient liquidity to fund ongoing operations, including working capital requirements, pension contributions, postretirement benefits, debt service, planned capital expenditures and other investments, as well as dividends and share repurchases as appropriate in the context of COVID-19 considerations. As of May 31, 2021, the Company's primary sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $366.5 million, cash from operations, and the Company's loan agreements in the U.S. and the UK. As indicated above, the U.S. loan agreement was amended on December 16, 2020, which reduced the borrowing limit from $375.0 million to $250.0 million, of which a maximum of $225.0 is available until the Company satisfies its pre-amendment financial covenants and the minimum liquidity covenant that has been added by the Amendment. The Company's amended U.S. loan agreement and its loan agreements in the UK total $237.1 million, less borrowings of $182.3 million and commitments of $0.4 million, resulting in $54.4 million of availability. Additionally, the Company has short-term credit facilities of $38.6 million, less current borrowings of $7.9 million and commitments of $3.9 million, resulting in $26.8 million of current availability at May 31, 2021. Accordingly, the Company believes these sources of liquidity are sufficient to finance its currently anticipated ongoing operating needs, as well as its financing and investing activities.\nThe following table summarizes, as of May 31, 2021, the Company's contractual cash obligations by future period (see Notes 5, 6, 9 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ amounts in millions </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due By Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td>1 Year or Less </td> <td> </td> <td>Years 2-3 </td> <td> </td> <td>Years 4-5 </td> <td> </td> <td>After Year 5 </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum print quantities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty advances </td> <td> </td> <td>32.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lines of credit and short-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>182.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>182.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and postretirement plans (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>380.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes principal and interest.\n(2) Excludes expected Medicare Part D subsidy receipts.\nFinancing\nLoan Agreements\nThe Company is party to two loan agreements, as well as certain credit lines with various banks. For a more complete description of the loan agreements, as well as the Company's other debt obligations, reference is made to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nAcquisitions\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company explores domestic and international expansion opportunities, including potential niche and strategic acquisitions. As part of this process, the Company engages with interested parties in discussions concerning possible transactions. The Company will continue to evaluate such expansion opportunities and prospects. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 | Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThe Company categorizes its businesses into three reportable segments: Children's Book Publishing and Distribution; Education; and International.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the Company's financial position and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes included in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nOverview and Outlook\nOverview\nRevenues in fiscal 2021 were $1.30 billion, a decrease of 12.6% from $1.49 billion in fiscal 2020, reflecting lower sales in the Company's Children's Book Publishing and Distribution segment of $210.7 million, primarily driven by a decline in book fair channel revenues as schools were not hosting fairs on-site due to COVID-19, partially offset by an increase in trade channel revenues as a result of strong demand for core frontlist titles and backlist titles from best-selling series. In the Education segment, revenues increased by $25.0 million on higher sales in several business lines, particularly Grab and Go and summer reading packs, instructional programs, and literacy partnerships as well as in the segment's teaching resources and digital subscription product categories. The decrease in local currency revenues in the International segment of $18.0 million was primarily due to lower book fairs channel revenues in Canada and the UK, coupled with a decrease in direct-to-home sales in Asia, and were largely offset by a favorable impact of foreign exchange of $16.9 million. Loss per diluted share was $0.32 for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to $1.27 in the prior fiscal year.\nOperating loss in fiscal 2021 was $22.7 million compared to $88.5 million in the prior fiscal year, representing an improvement of $65.8 million. The improvement year-over-year was directly attributable to the cost-saving initiatives implemented by the Company during fiscal 2021, which helped to mitigate the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's end markets and supply chain, coupled with the absence of the $40.0 million write down of inventory that occurred in fiscal 2020. The cost savings were partially offset by a mediation-assisted settlement of $20.0 million regarding certain licenses and trademarks related to intellectual property used in formerly owned products, exclusive of potential insurance recoveries. In addition, the Company recognized asset impairments of $11.1 million in fiscal 2021 related to the Company's plan to cease use of its leased office space in New York City and consolidate into the company-owned New York headquarters building and permanently close 13 of its 54 U.S. book fairs warehouses as part of a branch consolidation project. The Company also incurred higher severance costs of $10.0 million associated with an effort to align the Company's workforce size with COVID-impacted business volumes.\nFiscal 2021 results were significantly impacted by the pandemic as a large percentage of schools were operating in a remote or hybrid mode as a result of COVID-19 concerns and restrictions. However, the Company showed improved results in revenue and operating income during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, even as educators around the globe struggled with transitioning their students safely back to the classroom. While executing on the cost-saving program, the Company continued to make investments related to its key growth initiatives with a focus on book fairs recovery, new education solutions, including digital products and early childhood programs, increasing parent access to the Company's eCommerce platforms, English language learning in Asia, the acquisition and development of content for its trade and media operations, as well as continued technology investments to improve systems and processes, all of which are the foundation of the Company's growth strategy in fiscal 2022 and beyond.\nOutlook\nWhile uncertainty still remains with respect to COVID-19, the Company is beginning to see strengthening underlying trends across all businesses and school and trade markets, as students around the globe return to the classroom, educators look to dependable and effective ways for accelerating student achievement, and stores welcome shoppers without restrictions. The Company believes it is well-positioned to continue the growth patterns seen in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as markets recover, especially for the book fairs businesses in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., and expects stronger operating leverage and resulting cash flow given the successful reduction in labor and other operating costs from pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, the Company continues to identify further opportunities for incremental cost savings through process improvements and automation, consolidating functions, and increased utilization of the Company's international shared services resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral:\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements involves the use of estimates and assumptions by management, which affects the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current business factors, future expectations and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, all of which are necessary in order to form a basis for determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates the adequacy of its reserves and the estimates used in calculations, including, but not limited to: collectability of accounts receivable; variable consideration related to anticipated returns; allocation of transaction price to contractual performance obligations; amortization periods; stock-based compensation expense; pension and other postretirement obligations; tax rates; recoverability of inventories; deferred income taxes and tax reserves; the timing and amount of future income taxes and related deductions; recoverability of prepublication costs; royalty advance reserves; customer reward programs; and the impairment assessment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangibles. For a complete description of the Company's significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The following policies and account descriptions include all those identified by the Company as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations:\nRevenue Recognition:\nThe Company's revenue recognition policies for its principal businesses are as follows:\nSchool-Based Book Clubs - Revenue from school-based book clubs is recognized upon shipment of the products.\nSchool-Based Book Fairs - Revenues associated with school-based book fairs relate to the sale of children's books and other products to book fair sponsors. In addition, the Company employs an incentive program to encourage the sponsorship of book fairs and increase the number of fairs held each school year. The Company identifies two potential performance obligations within its school-based book fair contracts, which include the fulfillment of book fairs product and the fulfillment of product upon the redemption of incentive program credits by customers. The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognizes revenue at a point in time. The Company utilizes certain estimates based on historical experience, redemption patterns and future expectations related to the participation in the incentive program to determine the relative fair value of each performance obligation when allocating the transaction price. Changes in these estimates could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue. Revenue allocated to the book fairs product is recognized at the point at which product is delivered to the customer and control is transferred. The revenue allocated to the incentive program credits is recognized upon redemption of incentive credits and the transfer of control of the redeemed product. Incentive credits are generally redeemed within 12 months of issuance. Payment for school-based book fairs product is due at the completion of a customer's fair. Revenues associated with virtual fairs are recognized upon shipment of the products and related incentive program credits are expensed upon issuance.\nTrade - Revenue from the sale of children's books for distribution in the retail channel is primarily recognized when performance obligations are satisfied and control is transferred to the customer, or when the product is on sale and available to the public. For newly published titles, the Company, on occasion, contractually agrees with its customers when the publication may be first offered for sale to the public, or an agreed upon Strict Laydown Date.\" For such titles, the control of the product is not deemed to be transferred to the customer until such time that the publication can contractually be sold to the public, and the Company defers revenue on sales of such titles until such time the customer is permitted to sell the product to the public. Revenue for ebooks, which is generally the net amount received from the retailer, is recognized upon electronic delivery to the customer by the retailer. The sale of trade product generally includes a right of return.\nEducation - Revenue from the sale of educational materials is recognized upon shipment of the products, or upon acceptance of product by the customer, depending on individual contractual terms. Revenue from digital products is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription period. Revenue from professional development services is recognized when the services have been provided to the customer. Revenue from contracts with multiple\ndeliverables are recognized as each performance obligation is satisfied in which the transaction price is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis.\nFilm Production and Licensing - Revenue from the sale of film rights, principally for the home video, streaming and domestic and foreign television markets, is deferred during production and recognized when the film or episodes have been delivered and are available for showing or exploitation. Licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with royalty agreements at the time the licensed materials are available to the licensee and collections are reasonably assured.\nMagazines - Revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription period, as the magazines are delivered.\nDirect Sales and Export - Revenue from the direct sales channel is recognized upon acceptance of the physical product by the customer.\nThe Company has elected to present sales and other related taxes on a net basis, excluded from revenues, and as such, these are included within Other accrued expenses until remitted to taxing authorities.\nAccounts receivable:\nAccounts receivable are recognized net of an allowance for credit losses. In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to customers that satisfy predefined credit criteria. The Company recognizes an allowance for credit losses on trade receivables that are expected to be incurred over the lifetime of the receivable. Reserves for estimated credit losses are established at the time of sale and are based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and supportable forecasts impacting its ultimate collectability, including specific reserves on a customer-by-customer basis, creditworthiness of the Company's customers and prior collection experience. At the time the Company determines that a receivable balance, or any portion thereof, is deemed to be permanently uncollectible, the balance is then written off. A one percentage point change in the estimated bad debt reserve rates, which are applied to the accounts receivable aging, would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $2.2 million and approximately $2.8 million, respectively.\nEstimated returns:\nFor sales that include a right of return, the Company will estimate the transaction price and record revenues as variable consideration based on the amounts the Company expects to ultimately be entitled. In order to determine estimated returns, the Company utilizes historical return rates, sales patterns, types of products and expectations and recognizes a corresponding reduction to Revenues and Cost of goods sold. Management also considers patterns of sales and returns in the months preceding the fiscal year, as well as actual returns received subsequent to the fiscal year, available customer and market specific data and other return rate information that management believes is relevant. In addition, a refund liability is recorded within Other accrued expenses for the consideration to which the Company believes it will not ultimately be entitled and a return asset is recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the expected inventory to be returned. Actual returns could differ from the Company's estimate. A one percentage point change in the estimated reserve for returns rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $3.1 million.\nInventories:\nInventories, consisting principally of books, are stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value. The Company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based upon a calculation using the expected future sales of existing inventory driven by estimates around forecasted purchases, inventory consumption costs, and the sell-through rate of current fiscal year purchases. In accordance with the Company's inventory retention policy, expected future sales of existing inventory are compared against historical usage by channel for reasonableness and any specifically identified excess or obsolete inventory, due to an anticipated lack of demand, will also be reserved. The impact of a one percentage point change in the obsolescence reserve rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $3.6 million.\nLong-lived assets:\nLong-lived assets, including operating lease right-of-use assets, property, plant, and equipment, prepublication costs and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable. For the purposes of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. If impairment indicators are present, the Company performs a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset to its carrying amount. If it is determined that a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset. The fair values determined by the Company require significant judgment and include certain assumptions regarding future sales and expenses, discount rates and real estate market conditions.\nRoyalty advances:\nRoyalty advances are initially capitalized and subsequently expensed as related revenues are earned or when the Company determines future recovery through earndowns is not probable. The Company has a long history of providing authors with royalty advances, and it tracks each advance earned with respect to the sale of the related publication. Historically, the longer the unearned portion of the advance remains outstanding, the less likely it is that the Company will recover the advance through the sale of the publication, as the related royalties earned are applied first against the remaining unearned portion of the advance. The Company applies this historical experience to its existing outstanding royalty advances to estimate the likelihood of recovery. Additionally, the Company's editorial staff regularly reviews its portfolio of royalty advances to determine if individual royalty advances are not recoverable through earndowns for discrete reasons, such as the death of an author prior to completion of a title or titles, a Company decision to not publish a title, poor market demand or other relevant factors that could impact recoverability.\nGoodwill and intangible assets:\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized and are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.\nWith regard to goodwill, the Company compares the estimated fair values of its identified reporting units to the carrying values of their net assets. The Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its identified reporting units are less than their carrying values. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company measures goodwill impairment by the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit. For each of the reporting units, the estimated fair value is determined utilizing the expected present value of the projected future cash flows of the reporting unit, in addition to comparisons to similar companies. The Company reviews its definition of reporting units annually or more frequently if conditions indicate that the reporting units may change. The Company evaluates its operating segments to determine if there are components one level below the operating segment level. A component is present if discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of the business. If an operating segment only contains a single component, that component is determined to be a reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. If an operating segment contains multiple components, the Company evaluates the economic characteristics of these components. Any components within an operating segment that share similar economic characteristics are aggregated and deemed to be a reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. Components within the same operating segment that do not share similar economic characteristics are deemed to be individual reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes.\nThe Company has seven reporting units with goodwill subject to impairment testing. The determination of the fair value of the Company's reporting units involves a number of assumptions, including the estimates of future cash flows, discount rates and market-based multiples, among others, each of which is subject to change. Accordingly, it is possible that changes in assumptions and the performance of certain reporting units could lead to impairments in future periods, which may be material.\nWith regard to other intangibles with indefinite lives, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the identified asset is less than its carrying value. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs a quantitative test. The estimated fair value is determined utilizing the expected present value of the projected future cash flows of the asset.\nIntangible assets with definite lives consist principally of tradenames, customer lists, intellectual property and other agreements and are amortized over their expected useful lives. Customer lists are amortized on a straight-line basis over five to ten years, while other agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life. Intellectual property assets are amortized over their remaining useful lives, which is approximately five years.\nEmployee Benefit Plan Obligations:\nThe rate assumptions discussed below impact the Company's calculations of its UK pension and U.S. postretirement obligations. The rates applied by the Company are based on the UK pension plan asset portfolio's past average rates of return, discount rates and actuarial information. Any change in market performance, interest rate performance, assumed health care cost trend rate and compensation rates could result in significant changes in the Company's UK pension plan and U.S. postretirement obligations.\nPension obligations\nThe Company's UK Pension Plan calculations are based on three primary actuarial assumptions: the discount rate, the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of compensation increases. The discount rate is used in the measurement of the projected, accumulated and vested benefit obligations and interest cost component of net periodic pension costs. The long-term expected return on plan assets is used to calculate the expected earnings from the investment or reinvestment of plan assets. The anticipated rate of compensation increase is used to estimate the increase in compensation for participants of the plan from their current age to their assumed retirement age. The estimated compensation amounts are used to determine the benefit obligations. A one percentage point change in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $0.3 million and approximately $0.8 million, respectively. A one percentage point change in the expected long-term return on plan assets would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $0.4 million.\nOther Postretirement benefits\nThe Company provides postretirement benefits, consisting of healthcare and life insurance benefits, to eligible retired United States-based employees. The postretirement medical plan benefits are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, with the employee paying a portion of the premium and the Company paying the remainder. The existing benefit obligation is based on the discount rate and the assumed health care cost trend rate. The discount rate is used in the measurement of the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and the interest cost component of net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The assumed health care cost trend rate is used in the measurement of the long-term expected increase in medical claims. A one percentage point change in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $0.1 million.\nEquity Awards:\nStock-based compensation - The Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company recognizes the cost, based on the award's fair value at the date of grant, on a straight-line basis over an award's requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, except for the grants to retirement-eligible employees. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model requires management to make significant judgments and estimates. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the option-pricing model could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of option grants and the related expense. The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury rate in effect on the date of grant with a term equal to the expected life. The expected term is determined based on historical employee exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected dividend yield is based on actual dividends paid or to be paid by the Company. The volatility is estimated based on historical volatility corresponding to the expected life. The fair value of restricted stock units are assumed to be the per share market price of the Company's stock as of the date of grant.\nTaxes:\nIncome Taxes - The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, for purposes of determining taxable income, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on\ndifferences between financial reporting and tax basis of such assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be realized.\nThe Company believes that its taxable earnings, during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized, should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of the tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, the Company establishes a valuation allowance.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of on-going tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carryforwards, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to adjust the valuation allowance.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step method. Recognition occurs when an entity concludes that a tax position, based solely on technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. If a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, the amount recognized is the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. The Company assesses all income tax positions and adjusts its reserves against these positions periodically based upon these criteria. The Company also assesses potential penalties and interest associated with these tax positions, and includes these amounts as a component of income tax expense.\nThe Company assesses foreign investment levels periodically to determine if all or a portion of the Company's investments in foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely invested. Any required adjustment to the income tax provision would be reflected in the period that the Company changes this assessment. The Company elects to recognize the tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) earned by foreign subsidiaries as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred.\nNon-income Taxes - The Company is subject to tax examinations for sales-based taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing and, in certain cases, have resulted in assessments from taxing authorities. Where a sales tax liability with respect to a jurisdiction is probable and can be reliably estimated, the Company has made accruals for these matters and these amounts are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Future developments relating to the foregoing could result in adjustments being made to these accruals.\nResults of Operations\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

2021, the Company recognized a pretax mediation-assisted settlement of $20.0 regarding certain licenses and trademarks related to intellectual property used in formerly owned products and pretax branch consolidation and other business rationalization costs of $7.5. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized pretax severance expense of $23.1 and $13.1, respectively, related to cost reduction and restructuring programs. In fiscal 2020, the Company recognized a pretax charge of $1.0 related to a settlement of an intellectual property producing agreement and a pretax settlement expense of $1.5 related to an alleged patent infringement claim.\n(3) In fiscal 2021, the Company recognized a pretax impairment charge of $8.5 related to its plan to cease use of certain leased office space in New York City and consolidate into its company-owned New York headquarters building and a pretax impairment charge of $2.6 related to its plan to permanently close 13 of its 54 book fair warehouses in the U.S. as part of a branch consolidation project. In fiscal 2020, the Company recognized a pretax impairment charge of $40.0 related to the write down of inventory from lower anticipated requirements in the Company's club and fair channels and a pretax impairment charge of $0.6 related to an outdated technology platform in Canada.\n(4) In fiscal 2021, the Company recognized a pretax gain of $3.8 on the sale of its UK distribution center located in Southam and a pretax gain of $6.6 on the sale of its Danbury facility.\n(5) In fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized a benefit for income taxes in respect to one-time pretax charges of $15.5 and $15.3, respectively.\nResults of Operations - Consolidated\nThe section below is a discussion of the Company's fiscal year 2021 results compared to fiscal year 2020. A detailed discussion of the Company's fiscal year 2019 results and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal years 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for the year ended May 31, 2020, filed with the Company's Form 10-K dated July 24, 2020.\nRevenues from operations for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 decreased by $186.8 million, or 12.6%, to $1,300.3 million, compared to $1,487.1 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in revenues was due to lower Children's Book Publishing and Distribution segment revenues of $210.7 million and lower International segment revenues of $1.1 million, partially offset by increased revenues in the Education segment of $25.0 million. Within the Children's Book Publishing and Distribution segment, book fairs channel revenues decreased $219.5 million due to significantly lower in-person fair count as schools were not hosting fairs on-site due to COVID-19, coupled with lower book clubs channel revenues of $11.7 million due, in part, to decreased sponsorship as schools were operating in a remote or hybrid mode due to COVID-19. Lower revenues were partially offset by increased revenues from the trade channel of $20.5 million, driven by the release of a number of best-selling frontlist titles combined with higher backlist sales from best-selling series. Within the Education segment, increased revenues were driven by higher sales in several business lines, particularly Grab and Go and summer reading packs, instructional programs, and literacy partnerships, as well as in the segment's teaching resources and digital subscription product categories. Local currency revenues in the International segment decreased $18.0 million, primarily driven by lower book fairs channel revenues in Canada and the UK for a combined $26.1 million decrease and lower direct-to-home sales in Asia, partially offset by increased revenues in the trade channel across all international markets. The International segment revenues were also impacted by favorable foreign currency exchange of $16.9 million.\nComponents of Cost of goods sold for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>($ amounts in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td>% of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td>% of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product, service and production costs </td> <td>$ </td> <td>352.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>27.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>411.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>27.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty costs </td> <td> </td> <td>121.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepublication and production amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>26.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Postage, freight, shipping, fulfillment and all other costs </td> <td> </td> <td>165.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>193.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of goods sold </td> <td>$ </td> <td>666.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>51.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>751.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>50.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was 51.3%, compared to 50.5% in the prior fiscal year. The increase in Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by the sales decline in the book fairs channel, which traditionally has a higher mix of non-royalty bearing titles, coupled with higher trade sales, which typically have a higher royalty rate. In addition, the Company recognized higher inventory reserves in the book fairs channel due to the COVID-19 related sales decline, offset by lower inventory reserves in the book clubs and trade channels as a result of improved inventory management.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 were $584.9 million, compared to $722.5 million in the prior fiscal year. The $137.6 million decrease was driven by the Company's COVID-related cost-saving program, which included temporary employee furlough and reduced work week programs, the majority of which were discontinued at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, a more permanent restructuring initiative resulting in lower employee-related expenses, improvements in operating and financial processes, and other efforts to lower the Company's overall cost base. The Company also benefited from the participation in government subsidy programs resulting in subsidies of $11.2 million internationally and $8.6 million domestically. A substantial portion of the cost-saving program, excluding the employee furlough, reduced work week and government subsidy programs, is expected to bring permanent improvements to the Company's cost structure. The cost savings were partially offset by a mediation-assisted settlement of $20.0 million regarding certain licenses and trademarks related to intellectual property used in formerly owned products, exclusive of potential insurance recoveries, as well as higher severance expense, which increased to $23.5 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 from $17.2 million in the prior year period. Severance expense included a charge related to cost reduction and restructuring programs of $23.1 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $13.1 million in fiscal 2020. In addition, in fiscal 2021, the Company recognized restructuring\ncharges in the Philippines to scale back a non-profitable channel related the direct sales business of $4.2 million and branch consolidation costs of $3.3 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 were $60.5 million, which were relatively consistent to $61.5 million in the prior fiscal year. There were no significant changes to the assets in service in fiscal 2021.\nAsset impairments and write downs for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 were $11.1 million, compared to $40.6 million in the prior fiscal year. In fiscal 2021, the Company committed to a plan to cease use of its leased office space in New York City and consolidate into the company-owned New York headquarters and permanently close 13 of its 54 U.S. book fairs warehouses as part of a branch consolidation project. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment of the right-of-use assets associated with operating leases in the amount of $9.6 million and an impairment of $1.5 million of other long-lived assets, primarily leasehold improvements. The Company will continue to identify opportunities to consolidate distribution networks within the book fairs business. In fiscal 2020, changes were made to the Company's North American purchasing protocols, product offerings and inventory retention policies reducing the anticipated inventory requirements in the Company's school channels. As a result, the Company recorded a write down of inventory of $37.6 million and author advances and prepublication costs, related to the inventory, of $1.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively. In addition, in fiscal 2020, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $0.6 million related to an outdated technology platform in Canada.\nInterest income for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $0.4 million, compared to $3.1 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to lower U.S. interest rates on short-term investment balances. Interest expense for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $6.2 million, compared to $3.0 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to interest expense on increased debt borrowings.\nGain (loss) on sale of assets and other for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $10.4 million. The Company sold the company-owned facility located in Danbury, Connecticut and the UK distribution center located in Southam, recognizing a gain on sale of $6.6 million and $3.8 million, respectively.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was 40.1%, compared to 51.3% in the prior fiscal year. The lower benefit for income taxes when compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily driven by the rate differential on the prior fiscal year federal net operating loss carrybacks that did not repeat in the current fiscal year.\nNet loss for fiscal 2021 was $10.9 million compared to $43.7 million in fiscal 2020, an improvement of $32.8 million. The basic and diluted loss per share of Class A Stock and Common Stock was $0.32 in fiscal 2021, compared to $1.27 in fiscal 2020.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 was $0.1 million.\nResults of Operations - Segments\nCHILDREN'S BOOK PUBLISHING AND DISTRIBUTION\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ amounts in millions) </td> <td>2021 compared to 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ change </td> <td> </td> <td>% change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>664.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>875.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(210.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold </td> <td> </td> <td>344.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>430.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(86.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses * </td> <td> </td> <td>304.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>420.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(116.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairments and write downs </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Other operating expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses, bad debt expenses and depreciation and amortization.\nNM Not meaningful\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nRevenues for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 decreased by $210.7 million to $664.7 million, compared to $875.4 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in segment revenues is primarily driven by lower book fairs channel revenues of $219.5 million due to the significantly lower in-person fair count as schools were not able to host fairs on-\nsite due to COVID-19. Book clubs channel revenues decreased $11.7 million due to COVID-impacted delays in school reopenings coupled with a strategic reduction in certain offers and SKUs to enhance profitability. These revenue declines were partially offset by increased trade channel revenues of $20.5 million, driven by sales of current fiscal year releases including Dog Man: Grime and Punishment, Dog Man: Mothering Heights, The Ickabog\u00ae, Cat Kid Comic Club, The Baby-Sitters Club Graphic Novel #8: Logan Likes Mary Anne!, The Baby-Sitters Club Graphic Novel #9: Claudia and the New Girl, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: MinaLima Edition, and Wings of Fire, Book 14: The Dangerous Gift, increased backlist sales from best-selling series including Harry Potter\u00ae, Dog Man\u00ae, Hunger Games\u00ae, Captain Underpants\u00ae, The Bad GuysTM, Five Nights at Freddy's, Wings of Fire and The Baby-Sitters Club\u00ae GraphixTM, as well as increased sales of workbooks within the Scholastic Early Learners and BOB Books\u00ae lines and higher audio book sales. While there were strong sales of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel) in fiscal 2021, the prior fiscal year results benefited from higher sales of this title as the release occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nCost of goods sold for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $344.0 million, or 51.8% of revenues, compared to $430.9 million, or 49.2% of revenues, in the prior fiscal year. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by the sales decline in the book fairs channel which traditionally has a higher mix of non-royalty bearing titles, coupled with higher trade sales, which typically have a higher royalty rate. In addition, postage, freight and shipping costs as a percentage of revenues increased in the school-based channels due to higher volumes of direct ship-to-home and the payment of holiday surcharges as a result of industry-wide capacity constraints. The Company also recognized higher inventory reserves in the book fairs channel due to the COVID-19 related sales decline, offset by lower inventory reserves in the book clubs and trade channels as a result of improved inventory management.\nOther operating expenses were $304.4 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to $420.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The $116.5 million decrease was attributable to the cost-saving program, which included employee furlough and reduced work week programs in the first fiscal quarter as well as restructuring initiatives, resulting in a reduction in employee-related costs across all channels, a COVID-related governmental employee retention credit, lower book clubs kit costs and savings from the temporary closure of certain book fair distribution facilities. The decrease was partially offset by branch consolidation costs of $2.8 million within the book fairs channel.\nAsset impairments were $2.6 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021. The Company committed to a plan to permanently close 13 of its 54 book fairs warehouses in the U.S. as part of the branch consolidation project, resulting in the recognition of an impairment expense of $2.6 million, primarily related to the right-of-use assets associated with these warehouse operating leases. The Company intends to continue to identify opportunities to consolidate distribution networks within the book fairs business.\nSegment operating income for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $13.7 million, compared to $23.6 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily driven by the significant decline in book fairs channel revenues and related restructuring activities within the book fairs operations which resulted in asset impairment charges and branch consolidation costs. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales in the trade channel and increased profitability in the book clubs channel due to lower kit costs, as well as a reduction in employee-related costs, primarily in the school-based channels, attributable to the cost-saving programs implemented by the Company.\nEDUCATION\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ amounts in millions) </td> <td>2021 compared to 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ change </td> <td> </td> <td>% change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>312.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>287.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold </td> <td> </td> <td>108.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses * </td> <td> </td> <td>143.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.4) </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>102.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin </td> <td> </td> <td>19.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Other operating expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses, bad debt expenses and depreciation and amortization.\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nRevenues for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 increased by $25.0 million to $312.3 million, compared to $287.3 million in the prior fiscal year. The Company is winding down the custom publishing magazine business, which resulted in a decrease of $10.0 million in revenues compared to the prior fiscal year period. Excluding custom\npublishing business revenues, segment revenues increased $35.0 million driven by higher sales of the Company's Grab and Go and summer reading packs to school districts and community-based organizations, as well as higher sales of summer instructional programs, as educators attempted to keep students engaged during the summer after remote and hybrid learning imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company anticipates federal stimulus funds to be utilized by schools during the 2021/2022 school year to help students accelerate their learning post-pandemic. Digital revenues increased $4.7 million in fiscal 2021 due to higher sales of digital subscription products, including Scholastic Literacy Pro\u00ae and BookFlix\u00ae, coupled with a large school district sale of Scholastic Literacy Pro and Scholastic F.I.R.S.T.\u00ae digital programs for independent reading and foundational reading skills. In addition, the Company's teaching resources business revenues increased $10.0 million from sales of jumbo workbooks and early readers, as parents turned to these resources to supplement remote and hybrid learning resulting from COVID-19. This increase was partially offset by lower sales of the Company's classroom magazines and traditional classroom book collections as many school districts remained closed for in-person learning.\nCost of goods sold for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $108.4 million, or 34.7% of revenue, compared to $100.7 million, or 35.1% of revenue, in the prior fiscal year. In fiscal 2021, favorable product mix from higher digital sales and sales of take-home reading packs, as well as lower employee costs associated with professional services revenue as services were delivered virtually rather than in person, were offset by higher inventory reserves as a result of a shortened selling season due to COVID-19.\nOther operating expenses were $143.3 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to $156.7 million in the prior fiscal year. The $13.4 million decrease was primarily related to a decrease in employee-related costs as a result of cost-saving measures implemented to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.\nSegment operating income for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $60.6 million, compared to $29.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The $30.7 million improvement was primarily driven by revenue increases in a number of the segment's business lines, including Grab and Go and summer reading packs, instructional programs, literacy partnerships, digital product subscriptions, and teaching resources products, coupled with cost-saving measures taken to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.\nINTERNATIONAL\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ amounts in millions) </td> <td>2021 compared to 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ change </td> <td> </td> <td>% change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>323.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>324.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.1) </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold </td> <td> </td> <td>173.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.1) </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses * </td> <td> </td> <td>126.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26.9) </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairments and write downs </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6) </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Other operating expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses, bad debt expenses and depreciation and amortization.\nNM Not meaningful\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nRevenues for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 decreased by $1.1 million to $323.3 million compared to $324.4 million in the prior fiscal year, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of $16.9 million. Total local currency revenues across the Company's foreign operations decreased $18.0 million when compared to the prior fiscal year. In Canada, local currency revenues decreased $11.9 million primarily driven by lower school-based channel sales as a result of COVID-19 restrictions, partially offset by increased sales of best-selling trade titles. In the UK, local currency revenues decreased $8.4 million primarily due to lower volumes in the book fairs channel due to COVID-related school closures, partially offset by increased book clubs sales from parent-to-home orders, as well as increased sales of trade titles. In Asia, local currency revenues decreased $5.4 million primarily related to lower revenues from the direct sales channel and lower school-based channel revenues, primarily due to the adverse impact of COVID-19, partially offset by increased sales in the trade channel. In Australia and New Zealand, local currency revenues increased $5.5 million, primarily on higher revenue from the trade and book clubs channels, partially offset by lower volumes in the book fairs channel in Australia. In addition, revenues from foreign rights increased $3.4 million while the export channel revenues decreased $1.2 million as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nCost of goods sold for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $173.2 million, or 53.6% of revenues, compared to $177.3 million, or 54.7% of revenues. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues was due to lower fulfillment costs in the book fairs channel due to revenue declines, partially offset by higher royalty costs due to a sales shift to trade titles with higher royalty rates.\nOther operating expenses were $126.1 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to $153.0 million in the prior fiscal year. In local currencies, Other operating expenses decreased by $33.2 million primarily driven by lower employee-related expenses as a result of the cost-saving programs implemented by the Company and COVID-related governmental subsidy programs in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the UK which resulted in subsidies of $11.2 million in fiscal 2021. In addition, the Company recognized higher income from equity investments in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year. The decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by restructuring charges in the Philippines to scale back a non-profitable channel related the direct sales business of $4.2 million in fiscal 2021 and higher one-time severance expense which increased by $1.5 million to $2.6 million compared to $1.1 million in the prior fiscal year. Other operating expenses were also impacted by favorable foreign currency exchange of $6.3 million.\nThere were no asset impairments during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021. Asset impairments were $0.6 million in fiscal 2020 due to an impairment charge related to an outdated technology platform in Canada.\nSegment operating income for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $24.0 million, compared to operating loss of $6.5 million in the prior fiscal year. Total local currency operating results across the Company's foreign operations improved $30.1 million, primarily driven by COVID-related governmental employee retention programs and lower employee-related costs as a result of cost-saving measures, in addition to increased trade channel revenues and higher equity investment income, partially offset by lower revenues in the book fairs and direct sales channels as well as increased severance expense and business rationalization costs.\nOverhead\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nUnallocated overhead expense for fiscal 2021 decreased by $14.5 million to $121.0 million, compared to $135.5 million in the prior fiscal year. A substantial portion of the decrease is related to charges in the prior fiscal year period that did not reoccur in the current fiscal year period including the $40.0 million write down of inventory, a $1.5 million settlement charge related to an alleged patent infringement and a $1.0 million settlement arising from an intellectual property producing agreement. Also contributing to the decrease in costs were lower employee-related costs resulting from lower headcount from restructuring activities and a COVID-related governmental employee retention credit, and an overall reduction in spending including medical, outside services and consultants, travel, and supplies. This decrease was partially offset by one-time charges in the current fiscal year including a mediation-assisted settlement of $20.0 million regarding certain licenses and trademarks related to intellectual property used in formerly owned products, exclusive of potential insurance recoveries, an $8.5 million asset impairment related to the leased office space in New York City in connection with the consolidation into the company-owned New York headquarters and higher severance expense related to the cost-saving programs, which increased by $8.5 million to $20.5 million, compared to $12.0 million in the prior fiscal year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nCash provided by operating activities was $71.0 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $2.1 million for the prior fiscal year, representing an increase in cash provided by operating activities of $68.9 million. Despite lower revenues in fiscal 2021, the Company's cost-savings initiatives continued to drive an overall reduction in spending including employee-related costs, medical, outside services and consultants, travel, and supplies, as well as lower income tax payments in the U.S. The Company intends to continue to limit certain spending in view of the economic uncertainty brought on by the global pandemic, however, savings related to certain employee-related costs are not expected to continue into fiscal 2022.\nCash used in investing activities was $50.5 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to cash used in investing activities of $95.7 million for the prior fiscal year, representing a decrease in cash used in investing activities of $45.2 million. The decrease in cash used was primarily driven by the net proceeds from the sale of the Danbury facility and the Southam distribution center of $12.3 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The Company also had lower capital expenditures of $15.5 million as it continued to make strategic investments in key growth areas of the\nbusiness and technology, both internal and customer-facing, to allow it to operate with greater efficiency, and lower prepublication spending of $7.8 million. Additionally, in the prior year, the Company acquired land in the UK as part of a warehouse consolidation project and made other acquisition-related payments, both of which did not reoccur in the current fiscal year.\nCash used by financing activities was $52.3 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to cash provided in financing activities of $154.1 million for the prior fiscal year. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities of $206.4 million was primarily driven by the $200.0 million borrowing under the U.S. loan agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, with no additional borrowings made in fiscal 2021. The decrease was also attributable to a repayment of borrowings under the U.S. loan agreement of $25.0 million and lower short-term credit facility net borrowings of $12.4 million in fiscal 2021. This decrease was partially offset by the temporary suspension of the Company's share buy back program pursuant to which $35.5 million of common stock was reacquired in the prior fiscal year.\nCash Position\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $366.5 million at May 31, 2021 and $393.8 million at May 31, 2020. Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's U.S. operations totaled $318.0 million at May 31, 2021 and $364.2 million at May 31, 2020.\nDue to the seasonal nature of its business as discussed under Seasonality\u201d above, the Company usually experiences negative cash flows in the June through October time period. As a result of the Company's business cycle, borrowings have historically increased during June, July and August, have generally peaked in September or October, and have been at their lowest point in May. As a precautionary measure in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company accessed its committed bank credit facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 by taking a U.S. dollar LIBOR-based advance for $200.0 million, although there continues to be no immediate working capital requirement. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company paid down $25.0 million of the borrowing, resulting in $175.0 million outstanding as of May 31, 2021, which is classified as current effective as of the third quarter of fiscal 2021. On December 16, 2020, the U.S. loan agreement was amended, which, among other things, included adjustments to certain covenant thresholds and reduced the borrowing limit from $375.0 million to $250.0 million. See Note 5, \"Debt\" of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, \"Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for more information concerning the amended U.S. loan agreement. The Company intends to extend the current Loan Agreement, or enter into a new long-term bank credit facility, prior to its expiration on January 5, 2022.\nThe Company's operating philosophy is to use cash provided by operating activities to create value by paying down debt, reinvesting in existing businesses and, from time to time, making acquisitions that will complement its portfolio of businesses or acquiring other strategic assets, as well as engaging in shareholder enhancement initiatives, such as share repurchases or dividend declarations. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, there were no share repurchases as the Company's open-market buy-back program was, and continues to be, temporarily suspended in the face of COVID-19 uncertainties. Approximately $35.5 million of shares were repurchased in the prior fiscal year.\nThe Company has maintained, and expects to maintain for the foreseeable future, sufficient liquidity to fund ongoing operations, including working capital requirements, pension contributions, postretirement benefits, debt service, planned capital expenditures and other investments, as well as dividends and share repurchases as appropriate in the context of COVID-19 considerations. As of May 31, 2021, the Company's primary sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $366.5 million, cash from operations, and the Company's loan agreements in the U.S. and the UK. As indicated above, the U.S. loan agreement was amended on December 16, 2020, which reduced the borrowing limit from $375.0 million to $250.0 million, of which a maximum of $225.0 is available until the Company satisfies its pre-amendment financial covenants and the minimum liquidity covenant that has been added by the Amendment. The Company's amended U.S. loan agreement and its loan agreements in the UK total $237.1 million, less borrowings of $182.3 million and commitments of $0.4 million, resulting in $54.4 million of availability. Additionally, the Company has short-term credit facilities of $38.6 million, less current borrowings of $7.9 million and commitments of $3.9 million, resulting in $26.8 million of current availability at May 31, 2021. Accordingly, the Company believes these sources of liquidity are sufficient to finance its currently anticipated ongoing operating needs, as well as its financing and investing activities.\nThe following table summarizes, as of May 31, 2021, the Company's contractual cash obligations by future period (see Notes 5, 6, 9 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ amounts in millions </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due By Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td>1 Year or Less </td> <td> </td> <td>Years 2-3 </td> <td> </td> <td>Years 4-5 </td> <td> </td> <td>After Year 5 </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum print quantities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty advances </td> <td> </td> <td>32.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lines of credit and short-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>182.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>182.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td>28.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and postretirement plans (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>250.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>380.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes principal and interest.\n(2) Excludes expected Medicare Part D subsidy receipts.\nFinancing\nLoan Agreements\nThe Company is party to two loan agreements, as well as certain credit lines with various banks. For a more complete description of the loan agreements, as well as the Company's other debt obligations, reference is made to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nAcquisitions\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company explores domestic and international expansion opportunities, including potential niche and strategic acquisitions. As part of this process, the Company engages with interested parties in discussions concerning possible transactions. The Company will continue to evaluate such expansion opportunities and prospects. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d", "item_7_text": "Item 7 | Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThe Company categorizes its businesses into three reportable segments: Children's Book Publishing and Distribution; Education; and International.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the Company's financial position and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes included in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nOverview and Outlook\nOverview\nRevenues in fiscal 2021 were $1.30 billion, a decrease of 12.6% from $1.49 billion in fiscal 2020, reflecting lower sales in the Company's Children's Book Publishing and Distribution segment of $210.7 million, primarily driven by a decline in book fair channel revenues as schools were not hosting fairs on-site due to COVID-19, partially offset by an increase in trade channel revenues as a result of strong demand for core frontlist titles and backlist titles from best-selling series. In the Education segment, revenues increased by $25.0 million on higher sales in several business lines, particularly Grab and Go and summer reading packs, instructional programs, and literacy partnerships as well as in the segment's teaching resources and digital subscription product categories. The decrease in local currency revenues in the International segment of $18.0 million was primarily due to lower book fairs channel revenues in Canada and the UK, coupled with a decrease in direct-to-home sales in Asia, and were largely offset by a favorable impact of foreign exchange of $16.9 million. Loss per diluted share was $0.32 for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to $1.27 in the prior fiscal year.\nOperating loss in fiscal 2021 was $22.7 million compared to $88.5 million in the prior fiscal year, representing an improvement of $65.8 million. The improvement year-over-year was directly attributable to the cost-saving initiatives implemented by the Company during fiscal 2021, which helped to mitigate the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's end markets and supply chain, coupled with the absence of the $40.0 million write down of inventory that occurred in fiscal 2020. The cost savings were partially offset by a mediation-assisted settlement of $20.0 million regarding certain licenses and trademarks related to intellectual property used in formerly owned products, exclusive of potential insurance recoveries. In addition, the Company recognized asset impairments of $11.1 million in fiscal 2021 related to the Company's plan to cease use of its leased office space in New York City and consolidate into the company-owned New York headquarters building and permanently close 13 of its 54 U.S. book fairs warehouses as part of a branch consolidation project. The Company also incurred higher severance costs of $10.0 million associated with an effort to align the Company's workforce size with COVID-impacted business volumes.\nFiscal 2021 results were significantly impacted by the pandemic as a large percentage of schools were operating in a remote or hybrid mode as a result of COVID-19 concerns and restrictions. However, the Company showed improved results in revenue and operating income during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, even as educators around the globe struggled with transitioning their students safely back to the classroom. While executing on the cost-saving program, the Company continued to make investments related to its key growth initiatives with a focus on book fairs recovery, new education solutions, including digital products and early childhood programs, increasing parent access to the Company's eCommerce platforms, English language learning in Asia, the acquisition and development of content for its trade and media operations, as well as continued technology investments to improve systems and processes, all of which are the foundation of the Company's growth strategy in fiscal 2022 and beyond.\nOutlook\nWhile uncertainty still remains with respect to COVID-19, the Company is beginning to see strengthening underlying trends across all businesses and school and trade markets, as students around the globe return to the classroom, educators look to dependable and effective ways for accelerating student achievement, and stores welcome shoppers without restrictions. The Company believes it is well-positioned to continue the growth patterns seen in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as markets recover, especially for the book fairs businesses in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., and expects stronger operating leverage and resulting cash flow given the successful reduction in labor and other operating costs from pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, the Company continues to identify further opportunities for incremental cost savings through process improvements and automation, consolidating functions, and increased utilization of the Company's international shared services resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral:\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements involves the use of estimates and assumptions by management, which affects the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current business factors, future expectations and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, all of which are necessary in order to form a basis for determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates the adequacy of its reserves and the estimates used in calculations, including, but not limited to: collectability of accounts receivable; variable consideration related to anticipated returns; allocation of transaction price to contractual performance obligations; amortization periods; stock-based compensation expense; pension and other postretirement obligations; tax rates; recoverability of inventories; deferred income taxes and tax reserves; the timing and amount of future income taxes and related deductions; recoverability of prepublication costs; royalty advance reserves; customer reward programs; and the impairment assessment of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangibles. For a complete description of the Company's significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The following policies and account descriptions include all those identified by the Company as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations:\nRevenue Recognition:\nThe Company's revenue recognition policies for its principal businesses are as follows:\nSchool-Based Book Clubs - Revenue from school-based book clubs is recognized upon shipment of the products.\nSchool-Based Book Fairs - Revenues associated with school-based book fairs relate to the sale of children's books and other products to book fair sponsors. In addition, the Company employs an incentive program to encourage the sponsorship of book fairs and increase the number of fairs held each school year. The Company identifies two potential performance obligations within its school-based book fair contracts, which include the fulfillment of book fairs product and the fulfillment of product upon the redemption of incentive program credits by customers. The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognizes revenue at a point in time. The Company utilizes certain estimates based on historical experience, redemption patterns and future expectations related to the participation in the incentive program to determine the relative fair value of each performance obligation when allocating the transaction price. Changes in these estimates could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue. Revenue allocated to the book fairs product is recognized at the point at which product is delivered to the customer and control is transferred. The revenue allocated to the incentive program credits is recognized upon redemption of incentive credits and the transfer of control of the redeemed product. Incentive credits are generally redeemed within 12 months of issuance. Payment for school-based book fairs product is due at the completion of a customer's fair. Revenues associated with virtual fairs are recognized upon shipment of the products and related incentive program credits are expensed upon issuance.\nTrade - Revenue from the sale of children's books for distribution in the retail channel is primarily recognized when performance obligations are satisfied and control is transferred to the customer, or when the product is on sale and available to the public. For newly published titles, the Company, on occasion, contractually agrees with its customers when the publication may be first offered for sale to the public, or an agreed upon Strict Laydown Date.\" For such titles, the control of the product is not deemed to be transferred to the customer until such time that the publication can contractually be sold to the public, and the Company defers revenue on sales of such titles until such time the customer is permitted to sell the product to the public. Revenue for ebooks, which is generally the net amount received from the retailer, is recognized upon electronic delivery to the customer by the retailer. The sale of trade product generally includes a right of return.\nEducation - Revenue from the sale of educational materials is recognized upon shipment of the products, or upon acceptance of product by the customer, depending on individual contractual terms. Revenue from digital products is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription period. Revenue from professional development services is recognized when the services have been provided to the customer. Revenue from contracts with multiple\ndeliverables are recognized as each performance obligation is satisfied in which the transaction price is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis.\nFilm Production and Licensing - Revenue from the sale of film rights, principally for the home video, streaming and domestic and foreign television markets, is deferred during production and recognized when the film or episodes have been delivered and are available for showing or exploitation. Licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with royalty agreements at the time the licensed materials are available to the licensee and collections are reasonably assured.\nMagazines - Revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription period, as the magazines are delivered.\nDirect Sales and Export - Revenue from the direct sales channel is recognized upon acceptance of the physical product by the customer.\nThe Company has elected to present sales and other related taxes on a net basis, excluded from revenues, and as such, these are included within Other accrued expenses until remitted to taxing authorities.\nAccounts receivable:\nAccounts receivable are recognized net of an allowance for credit losses. In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to customers that satisfy predefined credit criteria. The Company recognizes an allowance for credit losses on trade receivables that are expected to be incurred over the lifetime of the receivable. Reserves for estimated credit losses are established at the time of sale and are based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and supportable forecasts impacting its ultimate collectability, including specific reserves on a customer-by-customer basis, creditworthiness of the Company's customers and prior collection experience. At the time the Company determines that a receivable balance, or any portion thereof, is deemed to be permanently uncollectible, the balance is then written off. A one percentage point change in the estimated bad debt reserve rates, which are applied to the accounts receivable aging, would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $2.2 million and approximately $2.8 million, respectively.\nEstimated returns:\nFor sales that include a right of return, the Company will estimate the transaction price and record revenues as variable consideration based on the amounts the Company expects to ultimately be entitled. In order to determine estimated returns, the Company utilizes historical return rates, sales patterns, types of products and expectations and recognizes a corresponding reduction to Revenues and Cost of goods sold. Management also considers patterns of sales and returns in the months preceding the fiscal year, as well as actual returns received subsequent to the fiscal year, available customer and market specific data and other return rate information that management believes is relevant. In addition, a refund liability is recorded within Other accrued expenses for the consideration to which the Company believes it will not ultimately be entitled and a return asset is recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the expected inventory to be returned. Actual returns could differ from the Company's estimate. A one percentage point change in the estimated reserve for returns rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $3.1 million.\nInventories:\nInventories, consisting principally of books, are stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value. The Company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based upon a calculation using the expected future sales of existing inventory driven by estimates around forecasted purchases, inventory consumption costs, and the sell-through rate of current fiscal year purchases. In accordance with the Company's inventory retention policy, expected future sales of existing inventory are compared against historical usage by channel for reasonableness and any specifically identified excess or obsolete inventory, due to an anticipated lack of demand, will also be reserved. The impact of a one percentage point change in the obsolescence reserve rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $3.6 million.\nLong-lived assets:\nLong-lived assets, including operating lease right-of-use assets, property, plant, and equipment, prepublication costs and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable. For the purposes of impairment testing, long-lived assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. If impairment indicators are present, the Company performs a recoverability test by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset to its carrying amount. If it is determined that a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset. The fair values determined by the Company require significant judgment and include certain assumptions regarding future sales and expenses, discount rates and real estate market conditions.\nRoyalty advances:\nRoyalty advances are initially capitalized and subsequently expensed as related revenues are earned or when the Company determines future recovery through earndowns is not probable. The Company has a long history of providing authors with royalty advances, and it tracks each advance earned with respect to the sale of the related publication. Historically, the longer the unearned portion of the advance remains outstanding, the less likely it is that the Company will recover the advance through the sale of the publication, as the related royalties earned are applied first against the remaining unearned portion of the advance. The Company applies this historical experience to its existing outstanding royalty advances to estimate the likelihood of recovery. Additionally, the Company's editorial staff regularly reviews its portfolio of royalty advances to determine if individual royalty advances are not recoverable through earndowns for discrete reasons, such as the death of an author prior to completion of a title or titles, a Company decision to not publish a title, poor market demand or other relevant factors that could impact recoverability.\nGoodwill and intangible assets:\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized and are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.\nWith regard to goodwill, the Company compares the estimated fair values of its identified reporting units to the carrying values of their net assets. The Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of its identified reporting units are less than their carrying values. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company measures goodwill impairment by the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit. For each of the reporting units, the estimated fair value is determined utilizing the expected present value of the projected future cash flows of the reporting unit, in addition to comparisons to similar companies. The Company reviews its definition of reporting units annually or more frequently if conditions indicate that the reporting units may change. The Company evaluates its operating segments to determine if there are components one level below the operating segment level. A component is present if discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of the business. If an operating segment only contains a single component, that component is determined to be a reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. If an operating segment contains multiple components, the Company evaluates the economic characteristics of these components. Any components within an operating segment that share similar economic characteristics are aggregated and deemed to be a reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. Components within the same operating segment that do not share similar economic characteristics are deemed to be individual reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes.\nThe Company has seven reporting units with goodwill subject to impairment testing. The determination of the fair value of the Company's reporting units involves a number of assumptions, including the estimates of future cash flows, discount rates and market-based multiples, among others, each of which is subject to change. Accordingly, it is possible that changes in assumptions and the performance of certain reporting units could lead to impairments in future periods, which may be material.\nWith regard to other intangibles with indefinite lives, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the identified asset is less than its carrying value. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs a quantitative test. The estimated fair value is determined utilizing the expected present value of the projected future cash flows of the asset.\nIntangible assets with definite lives consist principally of tradenames, customer lists, intellectual property and other agreements and are amortized over their expected useful lives. Customer lists are amortized on a straight-line basis over five to ten years, while other agreements are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life. Intellectual property assets are amortized over their remaining useful lives, which is approximately five years.\nEmployee Benefit Plan Obligations:\nThe rate assumptions discussed below impact the Company's calculations of its UK pension and U.S. postretirement obligations. The rates applied by the Company are based on the UK pension plan asset portfolio's past average rates of return, discount rates and actuarial information. Any change in market performance, interest rate performance, assumed health care cost trend rate and compensation rates could result in significant changes in the Company's UK pension plan and U.S. postretirement obligations.\nPension obligations\nThe Company's UK Pension Plan calculations are based on three primary actuarial assumptions: the discount rate, the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and the anticipated rate of compensation increases. The discount rate is used in the measurement of the projected, accumulated and vested benefit obligations and interest cost component of net periodic pension costs. The long-term expected return on plan assets is used to calculate the expected earnings from the investment or reinvestment of plan assets. The anticipated rate of compensation increase is used to estimate the increase in compensation for participants of the plan from their current age to their assumed retirement age. The estimated compensation amounts are used to determine the benefit obligations. A one percentage point change in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $0.3 million and approximately $0.8 million, respectively. A one percentage point change in the expected long-term return on plan assets would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $0.4 million.\nOther Postretirement benefits\nThe Company provides postretirement benefits, consisting of healthcare and life insurance benefits, to eligible retired United States-based employees. The postretirement medical plan benefits are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, with the employee paying a portion of the premium and the Company paying the remainder. The existing benefit obligation is based on the discount rate and the assumed health care cost trend rate. The discount rate is used in the measurement of the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and the interest cost component of net periodic postretirement benefit cost. The assumed health care cost trend rate is used in the measurement of the long-term expected increase in medical claims. A one percentage point change in the discount rate would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income for the year ended May 31, 2021 of approximately $0.1 million.\nEquity Awards:\nStock-based compensation - The Company measures the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company recognizes the cost, based on the award's fair value at the date of grant, on a straight-line basis over an award's requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, except for the grants to retirement-eligible employees. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model requires management to make significant judgments and estimates. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the option-pricing model could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of option grants and the related expense. The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury rate in effect on the date of grant with a term equal to the expected life. The expected term is determined based on historical employee exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected dividend yield is based on actual dividends paid or to be paid by the Company. The volatility is estimated based on historical volatility corresponding to the expected life. The fair value of restricted stock units are assumed to be the per share market price of the Company's stock as of the date of grant.\nTaxes:\nIncome Taxes - The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, for purposes of determining taxable income, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on\ndifferences between financial reporting and tax basis of such assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be realized.\nThe Company believes that its taxable earnings, during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized, should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of the tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely, the Company establishes a valuation allowance.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable earnings, with consideration for the feasibility of on-going tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carryforwards, to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, the Company may need to adjust the valuation allowance.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions using a two-step method. Recognition occurs when an entity concludes that a tax position, based solely on technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. If a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, the amount recognized is the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, which is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. The Company assesses all income tax positions and adjusts its reserves against these positions periodically based upon these criteria. The Company also assesses potential penalties and interest associated with these tax positions, and includes these amounts as a component of income tax expense.\nThe Company assesses foreign investment levels periodically to determine if all or a portion of the Company's investments in foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely invested. Any required adjustment to the income tax provision would be reflected in the period that the Company changes this assessment. The Company elects to recognize the tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) earned by foreign subsidiaries as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred.\nNon-income Taxes - The Company is subject to tax examinations for sales-based taxes. A number of these examinations are ongoing and, in certain cases, have resulted in assessments from taxing authorities. Where a sales tax liability with respect to a jurisdiction is probable and can be reliably estimated, the Company has made accruals for these matters and these amounts are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Future developments relating to the foregoing could result in adjustments being made to these accruals.\nResults of Operations\n\n(1) Represents percentage of total revenues.\n(2) In fiscal 2021, the Company recognized a pretax mediation-assisted settlement of $20.0 regarding certain licenses and trademarks related to intellectual property used in formerly owned products and pretax branch consolidation and other business rationalization costs of $7.5. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized pretax severance expense of $23.1 and $13.1, respectively, related to cost reduction and restructuring programs. In fiscal 2020, the Company recognized a pretax charge of $1.0 related to a settlement of an intellectual property producing agreement and a pretax settlement expense of $1.5 related to an alleged patent infringement claim.\n(3) In fiscal 2021, the Company recognized a pretax impairment charge of $8.5 related to its plan to cease use of certain leased office space in New York City and consolidate into its company-owned New York headquarters building and a pretax impairment charge of $2.6 related to its plan to permanently close 13 of its 54 book fair warehouses in the U.S. as part of a branch consolidation project. In fiscal 2020, the Company recognized a pretax impairment charge of $40.0 related to the write down of inventory from lower anticipated requirements in the Company's club and fair channels and a pretax impairment charge of $0.6 related to an outdated technology platform in Canada.\n(4) In fiscal 2021, the Company recognized a pretax gain of $3.8 on the sale of its UK distribution center located in Southam and a pretax gain of $6.6 on the sale of its Danbury facility.\n(5) In fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized a benefit for income taxes in respect to one-time pretax charges of $15.5 and $15.3, respectively.\nResults of Operations - Consolidated\nThe section below is a discussion of the Company's fiscal year 2021 results compared to fiscal year 2020. A detailed discussion of the Company's fiscal year 2019 results and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal years 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for the year ended May 31, 2020, filed with the Company's Form 10-K dated July 24, 2020.\nRevenues from operations for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 decreased by $186.8 million, or 12.6%, to $1,300.3 million, compared to $1,487.1 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in revenues was due to lower Children's Book Publishing and Distribution segment revenues of $210.7 million and lower International segment revenues of $1.1 million, partially offset by increased revenues in the Education segment of $25.0 million. Within the Children's Book Publishing and Distribution segment, book fairs channel revenues decreased $219.5 million due to significantly lower in-person fair count as schools were not hosting fairs on-site due to COVID-19, coupled with lower book clubs channel revenues of $11.7 million due, in part, to decreased sponsorship as schools were operating in a remote or hybrid mode due to COVID-19. Lower revenues were partially offset by increased revenues from the trade channel of $20.5 million, driven by the release of a number of best-selling frontlist titles combined with higher backlist sales from best-selling series. Within the Education segment, increased revenues were driven by higher sales in several business lines, particularly Grab and Go and summer reading packs, instructional programs, and literacy partnerships, as well as in the segment's teaching resources and digital subscription product categories. Local currency revenues in the International segment decreased $18.0 million, primarily driven by lower book fairs channel revenues in Canada and the UK for a combined $26.1 million decrease and lower direct-to-home sales in Asia, partially offset by increased revenues in the trade channel across all international markets. The International segment revenues were also impacted by favorable foreign currency exchange of $16.9 million.\nComponents of Cost of goods sold for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\n\nCost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was 51.3%, compared to 50.5% in the prior fiscal year. The increase in Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by the sales decline in the book fairs channel, which traditionally has a higher mix of non-royalty bearing titles, coupled with higher trade sales, which typically have a higher royalty rate. In addition, the Company recognized higher inventory reserves in the book fairs channel due to the COVID-19 related sales decline, offset by lower inventory reserves in the book clubs and trade channels as a result of improved inventory management.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 were $584.9 million, compared to $722.5 million in the prior fiscal year. The $137.6 million decrease was driven by the Company's COVID-related cost-saving program, which included temporary employee furlough and reduced work week programs, the majority of which were discontinued at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, a more permanent restructuring initiative resulting in lower employee-related expenses, improvements in operating and financial processes, and other efforts to lower the Company's overall cost base. The Company also benefited from the participation in government subsidy programs resulting in subsidies of $11.2 million internationally and $8.6 million domestically. A substantial portion of the cost-saving program, excluding the employee furlough, reduced work week and government subsidy programs, is expected to bring permanent improvements to the Company's cost structure. The cost savings were partially offset by a mediation-assisted settlement of $20.0 million regarding certain licenses and trademarks related to intellectual property used in formerly owned products, exclusive of potential insurance recoveries, as well as higher severance expense, which increased to $23.5 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 from $17.2 million in the prior year period. Severance expense included a charge related to cost reduction and restructuring programs of $23.1 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $13.1 million in fiscal 2020. In addition, in fiscal 2021, the Company recognized restructuring\ncharges in the Philippines to scale back a non-profitable channel related the direct sales business of $4.2 million and branch consolidation costs of $3.3 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 were $60.5 million, which were relatively consistent to $61.5 million in the prior fiscal year. There were no significant changes to the assets in service in fiscal 2021.\nAsset impairments and write downs for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 were $11.1 million, compared to $40.6 million in the prior fiscal year. In fiscal 2021, the Company committed to a plan to cease use of its leased office space in New York City and consolidate into the company-owned New York headquarters and permanently close 13 of its 54 U.S. book fairs warehouses as part of a branch consolidation project. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment of the right-of-use assets associated with operating leases in the amount of $9.6 million and an impairment of $1.5 million of other long-lived assets, primarily leasehold improvements. The Company will continue to identify opportunities to consolidate distribution networks within the book fairs business. In fiscal 2020, changes were made to the Company's North American purchasing protocols, product offerings and inventory retention policies reducing the anticipated inventory requirements in the Company's school channels. As a result, the Company recorded a write down of inventory of $37.6 million and author advances and prepublication costs, related to the inventory, of $1.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively. In addition, in fiscal 2020, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $0.6 million related to an outdated technology platform in Canada.\nInterest income for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $0.4 million, compared to $3.1 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to lower U.S. interest rates on short-term investment balances. Interest expense for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $6.2 million, compared to $3.0 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to interest expense on increased debt borrowings.\nGain (loss) on sale of assets and other for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $10.4 million. The Company sold the company-owned facility located in Danbury, Connecticut and the UK distribution center located in Southam, recognizing a gain on sale of $6.6 million and $3.8 million, respectively.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was 40.1%, compared to 51.3% in the prior fiscal year. The lower benefit for income taxes when compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily driven by the rate differential on the prior fiscal year federal net operating loss carrybacks that did not repeat in the current fiscal year.\nNet loss for fiscal 2021 was $10.9 million compared to $43.7 million in fiscal 2020, an improvement of $32.8 million. The basic and diluted loss per share of Class A Stock and Common Stock was $0.32 in fiscal 2021, compared to $1.27 in fiscal 2020.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 was $0.1 million.\nResults of Operations - Segments\nCHILDREN'S BOOK PUBLISHING AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n* Other operating expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses, bad debt expenses and depreciation and amortization.\nNM Not meaningful\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nRevenues for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 decreased by $210.7 million to $664.7 million, compared to $875.4 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in segment revenues is primarily driven by lower book fairs channel revenues of $219.5 million due to the significantly lower in-person fair count as schools were not able to host fairs on-\nsite due to COVID-19. Book clubs channel revenues decreased $11.7 million due to COVID-impacted delays in school reopenings coupled with a strategic reduction in certain offers and SKUs to enhance profitability. These revenue declines were partially offset by increased trade channel revenues of $20.5 million, driven by sales of current fiscal year releases including Dog Man: Grime and Punishment, Dog Man: Mothering Heights, The Ickabog\u00ae, Cat Kid Comic Club, The Baby-Sitters Club Graphic Novel #8: Logan Likes Mary Anne!, The Baby-Sitters Club Graphic Novel #9: Claudia and the New Girl, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: MinaLima Edition, and Wings of Fire, Book 14: The Dangerous Gift, increased backlist sales from best-selling series including Harry Potter\u00ae, Dog Man\u00ae, Hunger Games\u00ae, Captain Underpants\u00ae, The Bad GuysTM, Five Nights at Freddy's, Wings of Fire and The Baby-Sitters Club\u00ae GraphixTM, as well as increased sales of workbooks within the Scholastic Early Learners and BOB Books\u00ae lines and higher audio book sales. While there were strong sales of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes (A Hunger Games Novel) in fiscal 2021, the prior fiscal year results benefited from higher sales of this title as the release occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nCost of goods sold for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $344.0 million, or 51.8% of revenues, compared to $430.9 million, or 49.2% of revenues, in the prior fiscal year. The increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by the sales decline in the book fairs channel which traditionally has a higher mix of non-royalty bearing titles, coupled with higher trade sales, which typically have a higher royalty rate. In addition, postage, freight and shipping costs as a percentage of revenues increased in the school-based channels due to higher volumes of direct ship-to-home and the payment of holiday surcharges as a result of industry-wide capacity constraints. The Company also recognized higher inventory reserves in the book fairs channel due to the COVID-19 related sales decline, offset by lower inventory reserves in the book clubs and trade channels as a result of improved inventory management.\nOther operating expenses were $304.4 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to $420.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The $116.5 million decrease was attributable to the cost-saving program, which included employee furlough and reduced work week programs in the first fiscal quarter as well as restructuring initiatives, resulting in a reduction in employee-related costs across all channels, a COVID-related governmental employee retention credit, lower book clubs kit costs and savings from the temporary closure of certain book fair distribution facilities. The decrease was partially offset by branch consolidation costs of $2.8 million within the book fairs channel.\nAsset impairments were $2.6 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021. The Company committed to a plan to permanently close 13 of its 54 book fairs warehouses in the U.S. as part of the branch consolidation project, resulting in the recognition of an impairment expense of $2.6 million, primarily related to the right-of-use assets associated with these warehouse operating leases. The Company intends to continue to identify opportunities to consolidate distribution networks within the book fairs business.\nSegment operating income for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $13.7 million, compared to $23.6 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily driven by the significant decline in book fairs channel revenues and related restructuring activities within the book fairs operations which resulted in asset impairment charges and branch consolidation costs. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales in the trade channel and increased profitability in the book clubs channel due to lower kit costs, as well as a reduction in employee-related costs, primarily in the school-based channels, attributable to the cost-saving programs implemented by the Company.\nEDUCATION\n\n* Other operating expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses, bad debt expenses and depreciation and amortization.\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nRevenues for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 increased by $25.0 million to $312.3 million, compared to $287.3 million in the prior fiscal year. The Company is winding down the custom publishing magazine business, which resulted in a decrease of $10.0 million in revenues compared to the prior fiscal year period. Excluding custom\npublishing business revenues, segment revenues increased $35.0 million driven by higher sales of the Company's Grab and Go and summer reading packs to school districts and community-based organizations, as well as higher sales of summer instructional programs, as educators attempted to keep students engaged during the summer after remote and hybrid learning imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company anticipates federal stimulus funds to be utilized by schools during the 2021/2022 school year to help students accelerate their learning post-pandemic. Digital revenues increased $4.7 million in fiscal 2021 due to higher sales of digital subscription products, including Scholastic Literacy Pro\u00ae and BookFlix\u00ae, coupled with a large school district sale of Scholastic Literacy Pro and Scholastic F.I.R.S.T.\u00ae digital programs for independent reading and foundational reading skills. In addition, the Company's teaching resources business revenues increased $10.0 million from sales of jumbo workbooks and early readers, as parents turned to these resources to supplement remote and hybrid learning resulting from COVID-19. This increase was partially offset by lower sales of the Company's classroom magazines and traditional classroom book collections as many school districts remained closed for in-person learning.\nCost of goods sold for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $108.4 million, or 34.7% of revenue, compared to $100.7 million, or 35.1% of revenue, in the prior fiscal year. In fiscal 2021, favorable product mix from higher digital sales and sales of take-home reading packs, as well as lower employee costs associated with professional services revenue as services were delivered virtually rather than in person, were offset by higher inventory reserves as a result of a shortened selling season due to COVID-19.\nOther operating expenses were $143.3 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to $156.7 million in the prior fiscal year. The $13.4 million decrease was primarily related to a decrease in employee-related costs as a result of cost-saving measures implemented to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.\nSegment operating income for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $60.6 million, compared to $29.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The $30.7 million improvement was primarily driven by revenue increases in a number of the segment's business lines, including Grab and Go and summer reading packs, instructional programs, literacy partnerships, digital product subscriptions, and teaching resources products, coupled with cost-saving measures taken to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.\nINTERNATIONAL\n\n* Other operating expenses include selling, general and administrative expenses, bad debt expenses and depreciation and amortization.\nNM Not meaningful\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nRevenues for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 decreased by $1.1 million to $323.3 million compared to $324.4 million in the prior fiscal year, including a favorable foreign exchange impact of $16.9 million. Total local currency revenues across the Company's foreign operations decreased $18.0 million when compared to the prior fiscal year. In Canada, local currency revenues decreased $11.9 million primarily driven by lower school-based channel sales as a result of COVID-19 restrictions, partially offset by increased sales of best-selling trade titles. In the UK, local currency revenues decreased $8.4 million primarily due to lower volumes in the book fairs channel due to COVID-related school closures, partially offset by increased book clubs sales from parent-to-home orders, as well as increased sales of trade titles. In Asia, local currency revenues decreased $5.4 million primarily related to lower revenues from the direct sales channel and lower school-based channel revenues, primarily due to the adverse impact of COVID-19, partially offset by increased sales in the trade channel. In Australia and New Zealand, local currency revenues increased $5.5 million, primarily on higher revenue from the trade and book clubs channels, partially offset by lower volumes in the book fairs channel in Australia. In addition, revenues from foreign rights increased $3.4 million while the export channel revenues decreased $1.2 million as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nCost of goods sold for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $173.2 million, or 53.6% of revenues, compared to $177.3 million, or 54.7% of revenues. The decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues was due to lower fulfillment costs in the book fairs channel due to revenue declines, partially offset by higher royalty costs due to a sales shift to trade titles with higher royalty rates.\nOther operating expenses were $126.1 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to $153.0 million in the prior fiscal year. In local currencies, Other operating expenses decreased by $33.2 million primarily driven by lower employee-related expenses as a result of the cost-saving programs implemented by the Company and COVID-related governmental subsidy programs in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the UK which resulted in subsidies of $11.2 million in fiscal 2021. In addition, the Company recognized higher income from equity investments in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year. The decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by restructuring charges in the Philippines to scale back a non-profitable channel related the direct sales business of $4.2 million in fiscal 2021 and higher one-time severance expense which increased by $1.5 million to $2.6 million compared to $1.1 million in the prior fiscal year. Other operating expenses were also impacted by favorable foreign currency exchange of $6.3 million.\nThere were no asset impairments during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021. Asset impairments were $0.6 million in fiscal 2020 due to an impairment charge related to an outdated technology platform in Canada.\nSegment operating income for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021 was $24.0 million, compared to operating loss of $6.5 million in the prior fiscal year. Total local currency operating results across the Company's foreign operations improved $30.1 million, primarily driven by COVID-related governmental employee retention programs and lower employee-related costs as a result of cost-saving measures, in addition to increased trade channel revenues and higher equity investment income, partially offset by lower revenues in the book fairs and direct sales channels as well as increased severance expense and business rationalization costs.\nOverhead\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nUnallocated overhead expense for fiscal 2021 decreased by $14.5 million to $121.0 million, compared to $135.5 million in the prior fiscal year. A substantial portion of the decrease is related to charges in the prior fiscal year period that did not reoccur in the current fiscal year period including the $40.0 million write down of inventory, a $1.5 million settlement charge related to an alleged patent infringement and a $1.0 million settlement arising from an intellectual property producing agreement. Also contributing to the decrease in costs were lower employee-related costs resulting from lower headcount from restructuring activities and a COVID-related governmental employee retention credit, and an overall reduction in spending including medical, outside services and consultants, travel, and supplies. This decrease was partially offset by one-time charges in the current fiscal year including a mediation-assisted settlement of $20.0 million regarding certain licenses and trademarks related to intellectual property used in formerly owned products, exclusive of potential insurance recoveries, an $8.5 million asset impairment related to the leased office space in New York City in connection with the consolidation into the company-owned New York headquarters and higher severance expense related to the cost-saving programs, which increased by $8.5 million to $20.5 million, compared to $12.0 million in the prior fiscal year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020\nCash provided by operating activities was $71.0 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $2.1 million for the prior fiscal year, representing an increase in cash provided by operating activities of $68.9 million. Despite lower revenues in fiscal 2021, the Company's cost-savings initiatives continued to drive an overall reduction in spending including employee-related costs, medical, outside services and consultants, travel, and supplies, as well as lower income tax payments in the U.S. The Company intends to continue to limit certain spending in view of the economic uncertainty brought on by the global pandemic, however, savings related to certain employee-related costs are not expected to continue into fiscal 2022.\nCash used in investing activities was $50.5 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to cash used in investing activities of $95.7 million for the prior fiscal year, representing a decrease in cash used in investing activities of $45.2 million. The decrease in cash used was primarily driven by the net proceeds from the sale of the Danbury facility and the Southam distribution center of $12.3 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The Company also had lower capital expenditures of $15.5 million as it continued to make strategic investments in key growth areas of the\nbusiness and technology, both internal and customer-facing, to allow it to operate with greater efficiency, and lower prepublication spending of $7.8 million. Additionally, in the prior year, the Company acquired land in the UK as part of a warehouse consolidation project and made other acquisition-related payments, both of which did not reoccur in the current fiscal year.\nCash used by financing activities was $52.3 million for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, compared to cash provided in financing activities of $154.1 million for the prior fiscal year. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities of $206.4 million was primarily driven by the $200.0 million borrowing under the U.S. loan agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, with no additional borrowings made in fiscal 2021. The decrease was also attributable to a repayment of borrowings under the U.S. loan agreement of $25.0 million and lower short-term credit facility net borrowings of $12.4 million in fiscal 2021. This decrease was partially offset by the temporary suspension of the Company's share buy back program pursuant to which $35.5 million of common stock was reacquired in the prior fiscal year.\nCash Position\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $366.5 million at May 31, 2021 and $393.8 million at May 31, 2020. Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's U.S. operations totaled $318.0 million at May 31, 2021 and $364.2 million at May 31, 2020.\nDue to the seasonal nature of its business as discussed under Seasonality\u201d above, the Company usually experiences negative cash flows in the June through October time period. As a result of the Company's business cycle, borrowings have historically increased during June, July and August, have generally peaked in September or October, and have been at their lowest point in May. As a precautionary measure in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company accessed its committed bank credit facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 by taking a U.S. dollar LIBOR-based advance for $200.0 million, although there continues to be no immediate working capital requirement. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company paid down $25.0 million of the borrowing, resulting in $175.0 million outstanding as of May 31, 2021, which is classified as current effective as of the third quarter of fiscal 2021. On December 16, 2020, the U.S. loan agreement was amended, which, among other things, included adjustments to certain covenant thresholds and reduced the borrowing limit from $375.0 million to $250.0 million. See Note 5, \"Debt\" of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, \"Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for more information concerning the amended U.S. loan agreement. The Company intends to extend the current Loan Agreement, or enter into a new long-term bank credit facility, prior to its expiration on January 5, 2022.\nThe Company's operating philosophy is to use cash provided by operating activities to create value by paying down debt, reinvesting in existing businesses and, from time to time, making acquisitions that will complement its portfolio of businesses or acquiring other strategic assets, as well as engaging in shareholder enhancement initiatives, such as share repurchases or dividend declarations. During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, there were no share repurchases as the Company's open-market buy-back program was, and continues to be, temporarily suspended in the face of COVID-19 uncertainties. Approximately $35.5 million of shares were repurchased in the prior fiscal year.\nThe Company has maintained, and expects to maintain for the foreseeable future, sufficient liquidity to fund ongoing operations, including working capital requirements, pension contributions, postretirement benefits, debt service, planned capital expenditures and other investments, as well as dividends and share repurchases as appropriate in the context of COVID-19 considerations. As of May 31, 2021, the Company's primary sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $366.5 million, cash from operations, and the Company's loan agreements in the U.S. and the UK. As indicated above, the U.S. loan agreement was amended on December 16, 2020, which reduced the borrowing limit from $375.0 million to $250.0 million, of which a maximum of $225.0 is available until the Company satisfies its pre-amendment financial covenants and the minimum liquidity covenant that has been added by the Amendment. The Company's amended U.S. loan agreement and its loan agreements in the UK total $237.1 million, less borrowings of $182.3 million and commitments of $0.4 million, resulting in $54.4 million of availability. Additionally, the Company has short-term credit facilities of $38.6 million, less current borrowings of $7.9 million and commitments of $3.9 million, resulting in $26.8 million of current availability at May 31, 2021. Accordingly, the Company believes these sources of liquidity are sufficient to finance its currently anticipated ongoing operating needs, as well as its financing and investing activities.\nThe following table summarizes, as of May 31, 2021, the Company's contractual cash obligations by future period (see Notes 5, 6, 9 and 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d):\n\n(1) Includes principal and interest.\n(2) Excludes expected Medicare Part D subsidy receipts.\nFinancing\nLoan Agreements\nThe Company is party to two loan agreements, as well as certain credit lines with various banks. For a more complete description of the loan agreements, as well as the Company's other debt obligations, reference is made to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nAcquisitions\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company explores domestic and international expansion opportunities, including potential niche and strategic acquisitions. As part of this process, the Company engages with interested parties in discussions concerning possible transactions. The Company will continue to evaluate such expansion opportunities and prospects.
