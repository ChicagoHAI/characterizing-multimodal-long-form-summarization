For the past few years we have obtained loans, primarily from related parties, and incurred significant operating payables.\nIn the third quarter of 2011, we completed an acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Kansas. These properties include proved undeveloped and probable drilling opportunities. However, due to our working capital deficit discussed above, our primary challenge is to obtain additional financing to primarily address the significant working capital deficit and secondarily to seek to exploit existing drilling opportunities and possibly to acquire additional properties. We have sold some of these properties while retaining overriding royalty interests for future upside upon further development of the properties. In addition, from time to time we review opportunities for the purchase of production and underdeveloped oil and gas leases for future development. In order to purchase properties or begin substantive drilling activities we must obtain additional financing, which cannot be assured. We rely heavily on the skills of our board members in the areas of business development, capital acquisition, corporate visibility, oil and gas development, geology and operations.\nThere are no assurances that we can resolve our pressing capital needs, and although we have revenue from operations, our ability to execute our plans will still be dependent on our ability to raise additional capital. Our operating cash flow is dependent on the prices for crude oil. We also have a line of credit for $1,500,000 of which we have drawn $616,105.\nWhile we seek to reduce the amount of our variable costs on an ongoing basis, it is difficult to reduce or offset our fixed expenses related to being a public company, such as legal, accounting, transfer agent fees, reporting, corporate governance, and shareholder communications. We also incur cash costs for the due diligence, reserve studies, audits, and legal cost for any proposed acquisitions of oil and gas properties.\nOur future expectation is that monthly operating expenses will remain as low as possible until we can raise additional capital to address our working capital deficit.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company has identified the accounting policies described below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of the Company's results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the Company's business operations is discussed throughout this section where such policies affect the Company's reported and expected financial results. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities of the Company, revenues and expenses of the Company during the reporting period, and contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Company's consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that the actual results will not differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe record revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGL's and crude oil when delivery to the purchaser has occurred and title has transferred. We use the sales method to account for gas imbalances. Under this method, revenue is recorded on the basis of gas actually sold by us. In addition, we record revenue for our share of gas sold by other owners that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves. Our remaining over- and under-produced gas balancing positions are considered in our proved oil and gas reserves. Gas imbalances at December 31, 2014 and 2015 were not material.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make various assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes in these assumptions, judgments and estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events and, accordingly, actual results could differ from amounts initially established.\nThe most significant areas requiring the use of assumptions, judgments and estimates relate to the volumes of natural gas and oil reserves used in calculating depreciation, depletion and amortization, which we refer to as DD&A, the amount of expected future cash flows used in determining possible impairments of oil and gas properties and the amount of future capital costs used in these calculations. Assumptions, judgments and estimates also are required in determining future asset retirement obligations, impairments of undeveloped properties, and in valuing stock-based payment awards.\nOil and Gas Producing Activities\nIn January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which we refer to as the FASB, issued authoritative oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure guidance that was effective for the Company beginning in 2010. This guidance was issued to align the accounting oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with the requirements in the SEC final rule, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting\u201d, which was also effective in 2010.\nOur oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not find proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the Statements of Cash Flows. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive. Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized.\nOther exploration costs, including certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases, are charged to expense as incurred. The sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit-of-production DD&A rate. A gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of proved properties and is classified in other operating revenues. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, and renewals and betterments are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts.\nUnevaluated oil and gas property costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties if the properties are subsequently determined to be productive. Proceeds from sales of partial interests in unproved leases are accounted for as a recovery of cost without recognizing any gain until all costs are recovered. Unevaluated oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on a property-by-property basis based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance, commodity price outlooks and future plans to develop acreage.\nWe review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. We estimate the expected undiscounted future cash flows of our oil and gas properties and compare such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, the present value of estimated future cash flows, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected.\nThe provision for DD&A of oil and gas properties is calculated on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method. Natural gas is converted to barrel equivalents, BOE, at the rate of six Mcf to one barrel of oil. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, which are net of estimated salvage values, are taken into consideration.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe estimated fair value of the future costs associated with dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of oil and gas properties is recorded generally upon acquisition or completion of a well. The net estimated costs are discounted to present values using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate over the estimated economic life of the oil and gas properties. Such costs are capitalized as part of the related asset. The asset is depleted on the units-of-production method on a field-by-field basis. The associated liability is classified in current and long-term liabilities in the Balance Sheets. The liability is periodically adjusted to reflect (1) new liabilities incurred, (2) liabilities settled during the period, (3) accretion expense and (4) revisions to estimated future cash flow requirements. The accretion expense is recorded as a component of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe did not grant any stock options or warrants during 2015 and 2014 and no options or warrants were outstanding at any time during these years. We have issued shares of common stock for services performed by officers, directors and unrelated parties during 2015 and 2014. We have recorded these transactions based on the value of the services or the value of the common stock, whichever is more readily determinable.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nPresented below is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOil and Gas Producing Activities\nIn 2011, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement which resulted in our acquisition of producing oil and gas properties in Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas and Montana. Presented below is a summary of our oil and gas operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 777,123\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,797,230\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 143,907\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 361,053\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Royalty revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,871\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,369\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sale of oil and natural gas properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 27,120\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 391,585\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 953,021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,553,237\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (84,576\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (179,660\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease operating expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (754,362\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (791,142\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (160,011\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (36,250\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion ( DD&A\u201d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (816,481\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (767,857\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impairment expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,231,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,093,409\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 778,328\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net barrels of oil sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,956\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22,825\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Mcf of gas sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 62,630\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 70,195\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Barrels of Oil Equivalent ( BOE\u201d) sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 29,394\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 34,524\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average price per barrel of oil sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41.00\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78.74\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average price for per Mcf of natural gas sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.30\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.14\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease operating expense per BOE\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25.66\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22.92\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DD&A per BOE\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27.78\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22.24\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur oil sales are primarily attributable to our properties in Kansas and Wyoming. The average realized oil price for 2015 and 2014 were $41.00 and $78.74 per barrel, respectively, a decrease of 47.9% or $37.74 per barrel and our oil sales volumes decreased 3,869 barrels or 17.0%, resulting in barrels sold of 18,956 compared to 22,825 in the prior year. These decreases in oil price and volumes negatively impacted our oil sales revenues by $1,020,107 compared to the prior year. The impact of the lower prices reduced our revenue by $861,476 and the lower volumes impacted revenue by $158,631. This decrease in our oil sales volumes is attributed to the natural decline of production in our wells and to the inclement weather in March, April and May of 2015, which made it difficult to get back to the tank batteries and pick up the oil to transport it to the market. The wells automatically shut-in once the tank batteries become full.\nThe average realized natural gas prices, including proceeds from sales of natural gas liquids, was $2.30 and $5.14 per Mcf for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and our natural gas sales volumes decreased from 70,195 mcf in 2014 to 62,630 mcf in 2015, resulting in a decrease of 7,565 mcf or 10.8%. The impact due to lower prices resulted in a decrease of natural gas revenues of $199,764, while the impact of lower sales volumes decreased revenue by $17,382.\nProduction taxes on a per BOE basis for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, decreased 52.9% compared to the prior year. We generally expect production tax expense to trend with oil, gas, and NGL production revenue. Product mix, the location of production, and incentives to encourage oil and gas development can all impact or change the amount of production tax we recognize. Production taxes as a percentage of revenue was 8.3% and 9.1% during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGas Gathering\nWe have owned and operated a natural gas gathering system (pipeline and compressor station) for coal bed methane properties in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming since 2006. We have had no revenues relating to this system since June 2011 due to low natural gas prices which resulted in all wells in the field being shut-in. While this field is shut-in we do continue to perform routine maintenance to ensure it is in a safe condition. Operating expenses for 2015 and 2014 were $1,406 and $8,926, respectively. At December 31, 2015, we wrote off the remaining book value of this asset by recording $56,648 of impairment expense.\nGeneral and Administrative\nPresented below is a summary of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Director fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,833\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,450\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,383\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investor relations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 28,128\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 65,833\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (37,705\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal, auditing and professional services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 116,078\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 146,581\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (30,503\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consulting and executive services:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Related parties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 172,217\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 220,800\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (48,583\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrelated parties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 74,634\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 72,807\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,827\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (142\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 439,318\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 527,041\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (87,723\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $87,723 for 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to decreases in investor relations, legal, auditing and professional fees and related party consulting services. Director fees increased by $27,383 and other administrative expenses increased slightly by 1,827. The increase in directors fees is related to shares issued to two board members for five years of service on the board and the addition of a new board member increasing the board from 5 seats to 6 seats.\nWe have an operating agreement with DNR, whereby executive level expertise for our existing and prospective oil and gas properties is provided for a monthly fee of $18,000. This monthly charge is allocated $10,000 to consulting and executive services and $8,000 is allocated to lease operating expense. DNR is an affiliate of Charles B. Davis, an executive officer and director of the Company.\nWe had a net loss for 2015 of $4,747,053 compared to net income of $62,369 for 2014. This decrease was primarily due to decreased revenues from lower oil and natural gas prices and volumes and a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $3.3 million recorded as impairment expense related to our oil and gas properties and gas gathering system. Depreciation, depletion & amortization increased approximately $48,000 due to a lower reserve base. These costs were offset slightly by lower lease operating costs, which decreased approximately $37,000 and lower production taxes, which are directly related to revenue, which decreased approximately $95,000.\nInterest expense decreased from $135,773 for 2014 to $111,910 for 2015. The decrease of $23,863 was due primarily to the pay down of principal on certain notes payable.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn order to execute our drilling plans and to be in a position to seek to acquire additional interests in oil and gas properties that meet our objectives, we need to obtain significant additional financing. Historically, we have used a line of credit, preferred stock offerings and sales of oil and gas properties in order to fund our operations. In late 2015, we raised approximately $1.7 million through a private placement of our Series A2 Preferred Stock to accredited investors only. Also, since 2011, we have sold various interests in some of our oil and gas properties, which have resulted in aggregate net proceeds from three sales of $6,377,000. We intend to continue to sell properties, but only those properties that can be liquidated at attractive prices. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate any proceeds from the sale of our properties or that we will successfully raise additional capital from sales of our equity.\nWe had a working capital deficit as of December 31, 2015 of approximately $1.4 million, compared to a working capital deficit of approximately $1.3 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in our deficit was primarily due to the payable due to DNR related to a settlement agreement of approximately $300,000 that was accrued as part of operator fees and other in current liabilities, an increase in our current obligation for our asset retirement obligations and certain notes payable that are due within 12 months. This was offset with higher current assets, primarily due to sales of preferred stock.\nWe used $96,890 in operating cash flow during the year ended 2015 compared to $658,919 generated through operating cash flow during the year ended 2014. This is primarily related to lower oil and natural gas prices and lower sales volumes, which resulted in lower revenues of approximately $1.6 million.\nDuring 2015 investing activities used net cash of approximately $1.1 million, which was attributed to an acquisition of oil and gas properties that we closed on December 30, 2015. We also had capital additions of $68,631, which was offset with proceeds received of $50,000 for the sale of one of our wells. During 2014, we generated net proceeds of approximately $313,000 from a participation agreement in an oil and gas property, which was offset with capital additions of $640,000, resulting in net cash used in investing activities of $326,470.\nWe had approximately $1.7 million of net cash provided by financing activities in 2015, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $778,000 in 2014. We borrowed $67,000 against our line of credit during the year, we made principal payments to certain notes payables of $25,568 and we raised $1,665,000 through our Series A2 Preferred Stock private placement. The 2014 financing activities included borrowings of approximately $623,000. These funds were needed to fund our operations, a redemption of Series A1 Preferred Stock of $15,500, repurchase of 1,200,000 shares of common stock for $228,000, and repayment of notes payable of $1,157,000.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no operating leases in place.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn connection with the related party acquisition of oil and gas properties in the third quarter of 2011, we acquired interests in certain geologic zones of the properties. This agreement contained several arrangements that would require us to pay certain amounts depending on certain thresholds met. However, on January 19, 2016, but effective December 31, 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Sellers of these properties, whereby in consideration of the amounts indicated below, the parties (i) terminated Exhibits C and C-2 to the DNR and Tindall PSA for all purposes; (ii) extinguished all liabilities of the Company under Exhibit C of the DNR and Tindall PSA including $250,000, related to the increase in oil prices after the acquisition; (iii) agreed that the promissory note owed by us to DNR in the amount of $792,151 and accrued interest thereon was paid in full; and (iv) released each other against any and all claims which have been raised or could have been raised among them. Specifically, Exhibits C and C-2 to the DNR and Tindall PSA related to potential payments that would have been needed to be made by us in the event oil prices increased to certain levels and related to certain payments that would have been needed to be made by us in the event we sold certain properties purchased under the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Exhibits C and C-2 were terminated and extinguished (including any amounts owed thereunder including $250,000 under Exhibit C to the Purchase and Sale Agreement) in exchange for 25 fully paid, nonassessable restricted shares of our 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock. Consideration to pay the above promissory note in full consisted of us issuing to DNR 65 fully paid, nonassessable restricted shares of our 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock, and paying DNR $303,329 in cash.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period ( ASU 2014-12\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2014-12 require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d ( ASC 718\u201d), as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. The amendments in ASU 2014-12 are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in ASU 2014-12 either: (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.\u201d ASU 2014-08 changes the criteria for reporting a discontinued operation. Under the new pronouncement, a disposal of a part of an organization that has a major effect on its operations and financial results is a discontinued operation. The Company is required to adopt ASU 2014-08 prospectively for all disposals or components of its business classified as held for sale during fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2014. The adoption of ASU 2014-08 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition,\u201d and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition- Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts.\u201d ASU 2014-09's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under today's guidance, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017 and, at that time, the Company may adopt the new standard under the full retrospective approach or the modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the method and impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 will explicitly require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosure in certain circumstances. The new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-15.\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued new authoritative accounting guidance requiring debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the related debt liability. This guidance is to be applied using a retrospective method and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This guidance eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments may be applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company does not expect this to impact its operating results or cash flows.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16 (ASU 2015-16): Business Combinations (Topic 805), effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period, to simplify the accounting for measurement-period adjustments for an acquirer in a business combination. ASU 2015-16 requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The acquirer is required to adjust its financial statements for the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2015-16 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on our financial position and results of operations.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB, or other standards-setting bodies, that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements upon adoption.\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> Item 8.\n</td> <td> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAR\u00caTE INDUSTRIES, INC.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ar\u00eate Industries, Inc. at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Denver, Colorado\nMay 6, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n/s/ CAUSEY DEMGEN & MOORE P.C.\n</td>

of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAr\u00eate Industries, Inc. ( Ar\u00eate\u201d or the Company\u201d), is a Colorado corporation that was incorporated on July 21, 1987. The Company is in the business of exploration for and production of oil and natural gas. The Company's primary area of oil exploration and production is in Colorado, Montana, Kansas, and Wyoming.\nThe Company seeks to focus on acquiring interests in traditional exploratory and development oil and gas ventures, and seek properties that offer profit potential from overlooked and by-passed reserves of oil and natural gas, which may include shut-in wells, in-field development, stripper wells, enhanced recovery, re-completion and re-working projects. In addition, the Company's strategy includes the purchase and sale of acreage prospective for oil and natural gas and seeking to obtain cash flow from the sale and farm out of such prospects.\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> 2.\n</td> <td> Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of the Company's financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make various assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes in these assumptions, judgments and estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events and, accordingly, actual results could differ from amounts initially established.\nThe most significant areas requiring the use of assumptions, judgments and estimates relate to the volumes of natural gas and oil reserves used in calculating depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d), the amount of expected future cash flows used in determining possible impairments of oil and gas properties and the amount of future capital costs used in these calculations. Assumptions, judgments and estimates also are required in determining future asset retirement obligations, impairments of undeveloped properties, and in valuing stock-based payment awards.\nThe only component of comprehensive income that is applicable to the Company is net income (loss). Accordingly, a separate statement of comprehensive income (loss) is not included in these financial statements.\nCash Equivalents\nFor purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers cash and all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company's receivables consist mainly of trade account receivables from working interests in oil and gas production from partners with interests in common properties. Collectability is dependent upon the financial wherewithal of each entity and is influenced by the general economic conditions of the oil and gas industry. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts on a case by case basis once there is evidence that collection is not probable.\nGas Gathering System, Furniture and Equipment\nThe Company's gas gathering system and its furniture and equipment are stated at cost. Material expenditures that increase the life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs is charged to operating expenses as incurred. Upon disposal of an asset, the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gains or losses will be reflected in current operations. For the gas gathering system, depreciation is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of ten years. Depreciation of furniture and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of five years. At December 31, 2015, the Company wrote this asset off by recording an impairment charge against the gas gathering system of $56,648. Furniture and equipment was fully depreciated at December 31, 2015.\nOil and Gas Producing Activities\nThe Company's oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the well has proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not result in proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the Statements of Cash Flows. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive. Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized.\nOther exploration costs, including certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases, are charged to expense as incurred. The sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit-of-production DD&A rate. A gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of proved properties and is classified in other operating revenues. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, and renewals and betterments are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts.\nUnevaluated oil and gas property costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties if the properties are subsequently determined to be productive. Proceeds from sales of partial interests in unproved leases are accounted for as a recovery of cost without recognizing any gain until all costs are recovered. Unevaluated oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on a property-by-property basis based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance, commodity price outlooks or future plans to develop acreage.\nThe Company reviews its proved oil and gas properties for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. The Company estimates the expected undiscounted future cash flows of its oil and gas properties and compares such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, the present value of estimated future cash flows, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected. Once incurred, a write-down may not be reversed in a later period. At December 31, 2015, the Company recorded impairment against its oil and gas properties in the amount of $3,231,000 due to the sustained decline in oil prices in 2015 and forecasts for future prices. There was no impairment at December 31, 2014.\nThe provision for DD&A of oil and gas properties is calculated based on proved reserves on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method. Natural gas is converted to barrel equivalents, BOE, at the rate of six Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of oil. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, which are net of estimated salvage values, are taken into consideration.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe estimated fair value of the future costs associated with dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of oil and gas properties is recorded generally upon acquisition or completion of a well. The net estimated costs are discounted to present values using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate over the estimated economic life of the oil and gas properties. Such costs are capitalized as part of the related asset. The asset is depleted on the units-of-production method on a field-by-field basis. The associated liability is classified in current and long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The liability is periodically adjusted to reflect (1) new liabilities incurred, (2) liabilities settled during the period, (3) accretion expense and (4) revisions to estimated future cash flow requirements. The accretion expense is recorded as a component of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 8 - Asset Retirement Obligation.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenues from the sale of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids ( NGL\u201d) when delivery to the purchaser has occurred and title has transferred. The Company uses the sales method to account for gas imbalances. Under this method, revenue is recorded on the basis of gas actually sold by the Company. In addition, the Company will record revenue for its share of gas sold by other owners that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves. The Company also reduces revenue for other owners' gas sold by the Company that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves. The Company's remaining over and under produced gas balancing positions are considered in the Company's proved oil and gas reserves. Gas imbalances at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were not material.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nEnvironmental expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are expensed. Liabilities are accrued when environmental assessments and/or clean-ups are probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had not accrued for nor been fined or cited for any environmental violations that would have a material adverse effect upon capital expenditures, operating results or the competitive position of the Company.\nIndustry Segment and Geographic Information\nThe Company operates in one industry segment, which is the exploration, development and production of natural gas and crude oil, and all of the Company's operations are conducted in the continental United States. Consequently, the Company currently reports as a single industry segment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company did not grant any stock options or warrants during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and no options or warrants were outstanding at any time during these years. The Company has issued shares of common stock for services performed by officers, directors and unrelated parties during 2015 and 2014. The Company has recorded these transactions based on the value of the services or the value of the common stock, whichever is more readily determinable.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are reported in accordance with GAAP, which requires the establishment of deferred tax accounts for all temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using currently enacted federal and state income tax rates. In addition, deferred tax accounts must be adjusted to reflect new rates if enacted.\nRealization of deferred tax assets is contingent on the generation of future taxable income. As a result, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will be realized during periods when they are available, and if not, management provides a valuation allowance for amounts not likely to be recognized.\nManagement periodically evaluates tax reporting methods to determine if any uncertain tax positions exist that would require the establishment of a loss contingency. A loss contingency would be recognized if it were probable that a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nCash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and notes payable are carried in the Consolidated Financial Statements in amounts which approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and revenue receivables. The Company periodically maintains cash balances at a commercial bank in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit of $250,000. At December 31, 2015, the Company's uninsured cash balance was $271,666. The Company received 82% and 84% of its oil and gas production revenue from two purchasers during fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe concentration of credit risk in the oil and gas industry affects the overall exposure to credit risk because customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and other dilutive securities. The only potentially dilutive securities for the diluted earnings per share calculations consist of Series A2 preferred stock that is convertible into common stock at an exchange price of $2.00 per common share. As of December 31, 2015, the convertible preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation preference of $2,670,000 and was convertible to 1,335,000 shares of common stock. These shares were excluded from the earnings per share calculation because they would be anti-dilutive. All of the Series A1 preferred stock was redeemed during the year ended December 31, 2014, therefore, there was no outstanding preferred stock at December 31, 2014.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) available to common shareholder's - Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,747,053\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,945\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Plus: Preferred stock dividends\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) available to common shareholder's - Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,747,053\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,945\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,882,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,450,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Dilutive effect of stock options\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Dilutive effect of preferred stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average common shares outstanding - Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,882,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,450,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) per common share:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.37\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.01\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.37\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.01\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period ( ASU 2014-12\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2014-12 require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d ( ASC 718\u201d), as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. The amendments in ASU 2014-12 are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in ASU 2014-12 either: (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.\u201d ASU 2014-08 changes the criteria for reporting a discontinued operation. Under the new pronouncement, a disposal of a part of an organization that has a major effect on its operations and financial results is a discontinued operation. The Company is required to adopt ASU 2014-08 prospectively for all disposals or components of its business classified as held for sale during fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2014. The adoption of ASU 2014-08 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition,\u201d and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition- Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts.\u201d ASU 2014-09's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under today's guidance, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017 and, at that time, the Company may adopt the new standard under the full retrospective approach or the modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the method and impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 will explicitly require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosure in certain circumstances. The new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-15.\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued new authoritative accounting guidance requiring debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the related debt liability. This guidance is to be applied using a retrospective method and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This guidance eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments may be applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company does not expect this to impact its operating results or cash flows.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16 (ASU 2015-16): Business Combinations (Topic 805), effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period, to simplify the accounting for measurement-period adjustments for an acquirer in a business combination. ASU 2015-16 requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The acquirer is required to adjust its financial statements for the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2015-16 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on our financial position and results of operations.\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> 3.\n</td> <td> Acquisitions and Dispositions of Oil and Gas Properties\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisitions\nIn 2011, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement ( DNR and Tindall PSA\u201d) and other related agreements and documents with Tucker Family Investments, LLLP, which we refer to as Tucker\u201d; DNR Oil & Gas, Inc. which we refer to as DNR\u201d; and Tindall Operating Company, which we refer to as Tindall\u201d, and collectively we refer to these parties as the Sellers\u201d, for the purchase of certain oil and gas operating properties in Colorado, Kansas, Wyoming, and Montana. DNR is owned primarily by an officer and director of the Company, Charles B. Davis, and he is an affiliate of Tucker and Tindall. The consideration for the purchase was determined by bargaining between management of the Company and Mr. Davis, and the Company used reports of independent engineering firms to analyze the purchase price. The base purchase price was paid in full on September 29, 2011.\nOn January 19, 2016, but effective December 31, 2015, (the \"Effective Date\") we entered into a Settlement Agreement with Tucker, DNR and Tindall regarding the DNR and Tindall PSA and other related matters. In consideration of the amounts indicated below, the parties (i) terminated Exhibits C and C-2 to the DNR and Tindall PSA for all purposes; (ii) extinguished all liabilities of the Company under Exhibit C of the DNR and Tindall PSA including $250,000 related to the increase in oil prices after the acquisition; (iii) agreed that the promissory note of $792,151 due to DNR (See Note 5 - Notes and Advances Payable) and accrued interest thereon was paid in full; and (iv) released each other against any and all claims which have been raised or could have been raised among them. Specifically, Exhibits C and C-2 to the DNR and Tindall PSA related to potential payments that would have needed to have been made by the us in the event oil prices increased to certain levels and related to certain payments to have been made by us in the event we sold certain properties purchased under the DNR and Tindall PSA. Exhibits C and C-2 were terminated and extinguished (including any amounts owed thereunder including $250,000 under Exhibit C to the DNR and Tindall PSA) in exchange for 25 fully paid nonassessable restricted shares of our 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock. Consideration to pay the above promissory note in full consisted of the issuance to DNR of 65 fully paid, nonassessable restricted shares of its 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock, and paying DNR $303,329 in cash. A description of the terms of the 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock, including its terms of conversion into shares of the Company's common stock is set forth in Note 4 below. The Company recorded an expense of $141,099 included in other operating expense in the statement of operations as a result of this transaction.\nOn December 30, 2015, the Company completed an asset acquisition pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement executed on November 25, 2015, but effective December 1, 2015 (the \"Wellstar Purchase and Sale Agreement \") with Wellstar Corporation (the \"Seller\"), an unaffiliated corporation. The assets acquired were producing oil and gas leases in Sumner County, Kansas and Kimball County, Nebraska (collectively, the \"Properties\" and individually, the \"Padgett Properties\" and the \"Nebraska Properties\"). The Company acquired 51% of Seller's interest (ranging from 47% to 100% of the working interests) in the Padgett Properties and acquired 100% of the Seller's interest (100% of the working interests) in the Nebraska Properties for aggregate consideration of $1,100,000 and the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of the Company's restricted common stock valued at $0.10 per share at the date of closing, or $100,000.\nThe table below presents the purchase price allocation for the Wellstar Purchase and Sale Agreement:\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> Purchase Price allocation:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,100,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common Stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Consideration\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,200,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil and gas properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,404,493\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset retirement obligation assumed\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (204,493\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Purchase price allocation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,200,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPro-Forma information acquisition (unaudited)\nThe table below reflects unaudited pro forma results as if the acquisition of oil and gas properties had taken place as of January 1, 2014:\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,294,069\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,384,674\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,773,679\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 455,736\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,773,679\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 464,312\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.34\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.03\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.34\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.03\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe unaudited pro forma data gives effect to the actual operating results of the acquired properties prior to the acquisition, adjusted to include the pro forma effect of depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion based on the purchase price of the properties.\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> 4.\n</td> <td> Oil and Gas Properties\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth information concerning the Company's oil and gas properties:\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proved oil and gas properties at cost, net of impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,683,273\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,222,668\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unevaluated oil and gas properties at cost, net of impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 154,836\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 348,836\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3,223,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,476,898\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil and gas properties, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,615,109\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,094,606\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded depletion expense of $746,104 and $701,042, respectively.

There was no impairment expense during fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> 5.\n</td> <td> Fair Value Measurements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d, establishes a framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under FASB ASC 820 are described as follows:\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>Level 1 - Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets, for substantially identical assets and liabilities. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 for similar assets and liabilities. These include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. If the asset or liability has a specified or contractual term, the input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, generally requiring a significant amount of judgment by management. The assets or liabilities fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Further, although the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nUpon completion of wells, the Company records an asset retirement obligation at fair value using Level 3 assumptions.\nNonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis upon impairment. The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Company's assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Book Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Pre-tax\n(Non-cash)\nImpairment Loss\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proved oil and gas properties at cost, net of impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 315,138\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,386,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,071,447 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unevaluated oil and gas properties at cost, net of impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 154,783\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>314,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,553 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gas gathering system (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,648 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The gas gathering system was written off entirely at December 31, 2015.\nThe fair values of the properties were determined using discounted cash flow models. The discounted cash flows were based on management's expectations for the future. The inputs included estimates of future crude oil and natural gas production, commodity prices based on sales contracted terms or commodity price curves as of the date of the estimate, estimated operating and development costs, as a risk-adjusted discount rate of 10%.\nThe carrying amounts of other financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, account payables, accrued liabilities and long term debt in our balance sheet approximates fair value as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nStockholders' Equity\nCommon Stock\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company purchased an option to acquire rights in minerals owned by William W. Stewart (related party) for 150,000 shares of common stock valued at $34,500.\nOn January 30, 2014, the Company entered into a Direct Stock Purchase Agreement with Burlingame Equity Investors II L.P. and Burlingame Equity Investors Master Fund, L.P., whereby the Company purchased an aggregate 1,200,000 shares of its common stock from these entities at a price of $0.19 per share for total consideration of $228,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued 736,954 shares of common stock as compensation for services; 480,288 shares of common stock were issued for board services ranging in value from $0.10 to $0.20 per share and 256,666 shares of common stock were issued for consulting services provided by three related parties ranging in value from $0.10 to $0.16 per share.\nThe Company issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock valued at $0.10 per share or $100,000 related to the Wellstar Purchase and Sale Agreement that was executed on December 30, 2015. See Note 3 - Acquisitions, for additional information regarding this transaction.\nPreferred Stock\nOn September 29, 2011, the Company completed a private placement of its Series A1 Preferred Stock which resulted in the issuance of 522.5 shares for gross proceeds of $5,225,000.\nEffective June 28, 2013, several holders of the Company's Series A1 Convertible Preferred Stock elected to convert shares of such stock into the Company's common stock at a redemption price of $0.75 per common share. In connection with those redemptions all such holders agreed to waive all dividend rights on their shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock subsequent to March 30, 2013.

See additional discussion of the note below in Note 5 - Notes and Advances Payable.\nOn December 11, 2015, the Company began a private placement of its Series A2 7% Preferred Convertible Stock with a maximum amount of 600 shares at $10,000 per share or $6,000,000. At December 31, 2015, the Company had sold subscriptions equal to $1,750,000 (175 shares) and issued to DNR 90 shares fully paid ($900,000), nonassessable restricted shares of its 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock as part of the consideration for a settlement agreement entered into with DNR (See Note 5 - Advances and Notes Payable for details of the settlement).\nThe following are the terms of the Preferred Stock Series A2:\nAuthorized Shares, Stated Value and Liquidation Preference. Six hundred shares are designated as the Series A2 7% Convertible Preferred Stock, which has a stated value and liquidation preference of $10,000 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends.\nRanking. The Series A2 Preferred Stock will rank senior to future classes or series of preferred stock established after the issue date of the Series A2 Preferred Stock, unless the Company's Board of Directors expressly provides otherwise when establishing a future class or series. The Series A2 Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company's common stock but it is junior to the Company's outstanding debt and accounts payable.\nDividends. Holders of Series A2 Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends at an annual rate of 7.0% of the $10,000 per share liquidation preference, payable quarterly on each of March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31. Dividends are payable in cash or in shares of common stock (at its then fair market value), at the Company's election.\nVoting Rights. Holders of the Series A2 Preferred Stock will vote together with the holders of the Company's common stock as a single class on all matters upon which the holders of common stock are entitled to vote. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to such number of votes as the number of shares of common stock into which such share of Preferred Stock is convertible; however, solely for the purpose of determining such number of votes, the conversion price per share will be deemed to be $2.00, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustment. In addition, the holders of the Series A2 Preferred Stock will vote as a separate class with respect to certain matters, including amendments to the Company's Articles of Incorporation that alter the voting powers, preferences and special rights of the Series A2 Preferred Stock.\nLiquidation. In the event we voluntarily or involuntarily liquidate, dissolve or wind up, the holders of the Series A2 Preferred Stock will be entitled, before any distribution or payment out of the Company's assets may be made to or set aside for the holders of any of the Company's junior capital stock and subject to the rights of the Company's creditors, to receive a liquidation distribution in an amount equal to $10,000 per share, plus any unpaid dividends. A merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's property or business is not deemed to be a liquidation for purposes of the preceding sentence.\nRedemption by the Company. The Series A2 Preferred Stock is redeemable in whole or in part at the Company's option at any time for cash. The redemption price is equal to $10,000 per share, plus any unpaid dividends.\nOptional Redemption by Holder. Unless prohibited by Colorado law governing distributions to shareholders, the Company, upon 90 days' prior written request from any holders of outstanding shares of Series A2 Preferred Stock, in its sole discretion, may redeem at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) $10,000 per share and (ii) the accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date, up to one-third of each holder's outstanding shares of Series A2 Preferred Stock on: (i) the first anniversary of the Original Issue Date (the \"First Redemption Date\"), (ii) the second anniversary of the Original Issue Date (the \"Second Redemption Date\") and (iii) the third anniversary of the Original Issue Date (the \"Third Redemption Date\", along with the First Redemption Date and the Second Redemption Date, collectively, each a \"Redemption Date\"). If on any Redemption Date, Colorado law governing distributions to shareholders prevents the Company from redeeming all shares of Series A2 Preferred Stock to be redeemed, the Company may ratably redeem the maximum number of shares that it may redeem consistent with such law, and may also redeem the remaining shares as soon as it may lawfully do so under such law.\nPreemptive Rights. Holders of the Series A2 Preferred Stock do not have preemptive rights.\nMandatory Conversion. Each share of Series A2 Preferred Stock remaining outstanding will automatically be converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon the earlier of (i) any closing of underwritten public offering by us of shares of common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, in which the aggregate cash proceeds to be received by us and selling stockholders (if any) from such offering (without deducting underwriting discounts, expenses and commissions) are at least $7,000,000, and per share sales price is at least $3.00 (such price to be adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits or (ii) the date agreed to by written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series A2 Preferred Stock.\nOptional Conversion by Investors. At any time, each holder of Series A2 Preferred Stock has the right, at the holder's option, to convert all or any portion of such holder's Series A2 Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $2.00 per share prior to the mandatory conversion of the Series A2 Preferred Stock.\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> 7.\n</td> <td> Notes and advances payable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNotes payable consist of the following as of December 31:\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Officers, directors and affiliates:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Note payable, interest at 7.5%, due March 2016 (6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 150,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 150,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable, interest 7.0%, due January 2019 (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 63,464\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 79,970\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable, interest varies (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 792,151\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Collateralized note payable (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 120,728\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 120,728\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total officers, directors and affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 334,192\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,142,849\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Current portion of officers, directors, and affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,900\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 288,258\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term portion of officers, directors, and affiliates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 315,292\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 854,591\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrelated parties:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable, interest at 7.5%, due March 2016 (7)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Note payable, interest variable (see below) due January 2016, Extended to May 2016 (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 616,105\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 549,105\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Note payable, interest at 7.0%, due August 2016 (8)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 62,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 62,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable, interest at 7.0%, due January 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 32,606\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 41,668\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable, interest at 7.0%, due January 2016, Extended to May 2016 (5)(8)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 183,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 183,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total unrelated parties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 993,711\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 935,773\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Current portion of unrelated parties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 970,953\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 872,239\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term portion of unrelated parties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,758\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,534\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>On April 29, 2013, the Company executed a promissory note under which the Company agreed to pay Apex Financial Services Corp, a Colorado corporation, ( Apex\u201d) the principal sum of $1,000,000, with interest accruing at an annual rate of 7.5%, with principal and interest due on May 31, 2014, and subsequently extended to March 31, 2017.

The Company's policy is to recognize any interest or penalties as a component of income tax expense. The Company's material taxing jurisdictions are comprised of the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the states of Colorado, Wyoming and Kansas.

The Company's ARO primarily represents the estimated present value of the amounts expected to be incurred to plug, abandon and remediate producing and shut-in wells at the end of their productive lives in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. The Company determines the estimated fair value of its ARO by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to plugging and abandonment liabilities. The significant inputs used to calculate such liabilities include estimates of costs to be incurred; the Company's credit adjusted discount rates, inflation rates and estimated dates of abandonment. The ARO is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized asset retirement costs are amortized using the unit of production method.\nA reconciliation of the Company's ARO for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, beginning of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 749,013\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 682,203\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Liabilities incurred upon acquisition of properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 204,493\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Liabilities settled\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (28,684\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 70,375\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 66,810\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revisions of prior estimates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 995,197\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 749,013\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less current asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (409,621\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (191,843\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 585,576\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 557,170\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> 11.\n</td> <td> Commitments and Contingencies\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLease commitments.

The Company believes such information is essential for a proper understanding and assessment of the data presented.\nAs of December 31, 2014, future cash inflows were computed by applying the SEC-mandated 12 month arithmetic average of the first of month price for January through December of 2014, which resulted in benchmark prices of $94.99 per barrel for crude oil and $4.35 per MMbtu for natural gas. Prices were further adjusted for transportation, quality and basis differentials, which resulted in an average price used as of December 31, 2014, of $84.09 per barrel of oil and $6.09 per Mcf for natural gas.\nAs of December 31, 2015, future cash inflows were computed by applying the SEC-mandated 12 month arithmetic average of the first of month price for January through December of 2015, which resulted in benchmark prices of $50.28 per barrel for crude oil and $2.587 per MMbtu for natural gas. Prices were further adjusted for transportation, quality and basis differentials, which resulted in a difference from the benchmark prices ranging from -$3.40 per barrel to -$10.77 per barrel, depending on the location of the wells. The calculated natural gas differentials ranged from -81% to +59% as a percentage of the benchmark prices depending on where the well was located.\nThe assumptions used to compute estimated future cash inflows do not necessarily reflect the Company's expectations of actual revenues or costs, nor their present worth. In addition, variations from the expected production rate also could result directly or indirectly from factors outside of the Company's control, such as unexpected delays in development, changes in prices or regulatory or environmental policies. The reserve valuation further assumes that all reserves will be disposed of by production. However, if reserves are sold in place, additional economic considerations could also affect the amount of cash eventually realized.\nFuture development and production costs are computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions.\nFuture income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already legislated, to the future pre-tax net cash flows relating to the Company's proved oil and gas reserves. Net operating losses incurred in oil and gas producing activities are utilized to reduce taxable income. Permanent differences in oil and gas related tax credits and allowances are recognized, if reasonably estimable.\nA 10% annual discount rate was used to reflect the timing of the future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves. The following table presents the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2013 and 2014:\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Future cash inflows\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,002,030\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,132,987\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Future production costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (7,976,560\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9,732,541\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Future development costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (781,442\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Future income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,905,627\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Future net cash flows\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,025,470\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,713,377\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10% annual discount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,472,800\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,724,250\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,552,670\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,989,127\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe present value (at a 10% annual discount) of future net cash flows from the Company's proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of its estimated oil and gas reserves. The Company bases the estimated discounted future net cash flows from its proved reserves on average prices realized in the preceding year and on costs in effect at the end of the year. However, actual future net cash flows from the Company's oil and gas properties will also be affected by factors such as actual prices the Company receives for oil and gas, the amount and timing of actual production, supply of and demand for oil and gas and changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both the Company's production and incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% annual discount factor the Company uses when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the Company or the oil and gas industry in general.\nA summary of changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is as follows for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014:\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, beginning of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,989,127\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,154,647\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales of oil and gas, net of production costs and taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23,891\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,190,850\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchases of reserves in place\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 589,190\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales of reserves in place\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in development costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (699,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 98,054\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revisions of previous estimates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (440,871\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 213,112\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in prices and production costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,661,912\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (341,335\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net changes in income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,153,332\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 440,034\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion of discount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 598,913\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 615,465\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,552,670\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,989,127\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> Item 9.\n</td> <td> CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNot Applicable.\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> Item 9A.\n</td> <td> CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2015, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the Certifying Officers\u201d) conducted evaluations of our disclosure controls and procedures. As defined under Sections 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, the term disclosure controls and procedures\u201d means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including the Certifying Officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Certifying Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by our management on a timely basis in order to comply with the disclosure requirements under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO\u201d) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following material weaknesses.\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> We have not developed and effectively communicated our accounting policies and procedures, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Our controls over financial statement disclosures were determined to be ineffective.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nThe annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.

All services performed by Causey Demgen and Moore, P.C. in 2015 and 2014 were pre-approved by our Audit Committee. Having considered whether the provision of the auditors' services other than for the annual audit and quarterly reviews is compatible with its independence, the Audit Committee has concluded that it is.\nThe Audit Committee on an annual basis reviews audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditors. All audit and non-audit services are pre-approved by the Audit Committee, which considers, among other things, the possible effect of the performance of such services on the auditors' independence. All requests for services to be provided by the independent auditor, which must include a description of the services to be rendered and the amount of corresponding fees, are submitted to the Chief Executive or Financial Officer. The Chief Executive or Financial Officer authorizes services that have been pre-approved by the Audit Committee. If there is any question as to whether a proposed service fits within a pre-approved service, the Audit Committee chair is consulted for a determination. The Chief Executive or Financial Officer submits requests or applications to provide services that have not been pre-approved by the Audit Committee, which must include an affirmation by the Chief Executive or Financial Officer and the independent auditor that the request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, to the Audit Committee (or its chair or any of its other members pursuant to delegated authority) for approval.\n(ii) 100 per cent of the fees billed by the principal accountant were approved by the Audit Committee (described in paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X).\n6.

For the past few years we have obtained loans, primarily from related parties, and incurred significant operating payables.\nIn the third quarter of 2011, we completed an acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Kansas. These properties include proved undeveloped and probable drilling opportunities. However, due to our working capital deficit discussed above, our primary challenge is to obtain additional financing to primarily address the significant working capital deficit and secondarily to seek to exploit existing drilling opportunities and possibly to acquire additional properties. We have sold some of these properties while retaining overriding royalty interests for future upside upon further development of the properties. In addition, from time to time we review opportunities for the purchase of production and underdeveloped oil and gas leases for future development. In order to purchase properties or begin substantive drilling activities we must obtain additional financing, which cannot be assured. We rely heavily on the skills of our board members in the areas of business development, capital acquisition, corporate visibility, oil and gas development, geology and operations.\nThere are no assurances that we can resolve our pressing capital needs, and although we have revenue from operations, our ability to execute our plans will still be dependent on our ability to raise additional capital. Our operating cash flow is dependent on the prices for crude oil. We also have a line of credit for $1,500,000 of which we have drawn $616,105.\nWhile we seek to reduce the amount of our variable costs on an ongoing basis, it is difficult to reduce or offset our fixed expenses related to being a public company, such as legal, accounting, transfer agent fees, reporting, corporate governance, and shareholder communications. We also incur cash costs for the due diligence, reserve studies, audits, and legal cost for any proposed acquisitions of oil and gas properties.\nOur future expectation is that monthly operating expenses will remain as low as possible until we can raise additional capital to address our working capital deficit.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company has identified the accounting policies described below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of the Company's results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the Company's business operations is discussed throughout this section where such policies affect the Company's reported and expected financial results. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities of the Company, revenues and expenses of the Company during the reporting period, and contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Company's consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that the actual results will not differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe record revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGL's and crude oil when delivery to the purchaser has occurred and title has transferred. We use the sales method to account for gas imbalances. Under this method, revenue is recorded on the basis of gas actually sold by us. In addition, we record revenue for our share of gas sold by other owners that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves. Our remaining over- and under-produced gas balancing positions are considered in our proved oil and gas reserves. Gas imbalances at December 31, 2014 and 2015 were not material.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make various assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes in these assumptions, judgments and estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events and, accordingly, actual results could differ from amounts initially established.\nThe most significant areas requiring the use of assumptions, judgments and estimates relate to the volumes of natural gas and oil reserves used in calculating depreciation, depletion and amortization, which we refer to as DD&A, the amount of expected future cash flows used in determining possible impairments of oil and gas properties and the amount of future capital costs used in these calculations. Assumptions, judgments and estimates also are required in determining future asset retirement obligations, impairments of undeveloped properties, and in valuing stock-based payment awards.\nOil and Gas Producing Activities\nIn January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which we refer to as the FASB, issued authoritative oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure guidance that was effective for the Company beginning in 2010. This guidance was issued to align the accounting oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with the requirements in the SEC final rule, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting\u201d, which was also effective in 2010.\nOur oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not find proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the Statements of Cash Flows. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive. Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized.\nOther exploration costs, including certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases, are charged to expense as incurred. The sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit-of-production DD&A rate. A gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of proved properties and is classified in other operating revenues. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, and renewals and betterments are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts.\nUnevaluated oil and gas property costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties if the properties are subsequently determined to be productive. Proceeds from sales of partial interests in unproved leases are accounted for as a recovery of cost without recognizing any gain until all costs are recovered. Unevaluated oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on a property-by-property basis based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance, commodity price outlooks and future plans to develop acreage.\nWe review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. We estimate the expected undiscounted future cash flows of our oil and gas properties and compare such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, the present value of estimated future cash flows, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected.\nThe provision for DD&A of oil and gas properties is calculated on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method. Natural gas is converted to barrel equivalents, BOE, at the rate of six Mcf to one barrel of oil. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, which are net of estimated salvage values, are taken into consideration.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe estimated fair value of the future costs associated with dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of oil and gas properties is recorded generally upon acquisition or completion of a well. The net estimated costs are discounted to present values using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate over the estimated economic life of the oil and gas properties. Such costs are capitalized as part of the related asset. The asset is depleted on the units-of-production method on a field-by-field basis. The associated liability is classified in current and long-term liabilities in the Balance Sheets. The liability is periodically adjusted to reflect (1) new liabilities incurred, (2) liabilities settled during the period, (3) accretion expense and (4) revisions to estimated future cash flow requirements. The accretion expense is recorded as a component of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe did not grant any stock options or warrants during 2015 and 2014 and no options or warrants were outstanding at any time during these years. We have issued shares of common stock for services performed by officers, directors and unrelated parties during 2015 and 2014. We have recorded these transactions based on the value of the services or the value of the common stock, whichever is more readily determinable.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nPresented below is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOil and Gas Producing Activities\nIn 2011, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement which resulted in our acquisition of producing oil and gas properties in Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas and Montana. Presented below is a summary of our oil and gas operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 777,123\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,797,230\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 143,907\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 361,053\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Royalty revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,871\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,369\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sale of oil and natural gas properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 27,120\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 391,585\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 953,021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,553,237\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (84,576\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (179,660\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease operating expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (754,362\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (791,142\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (160,011\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (36,250\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion ( DD&A\u201d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (816,481\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (767,857\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impairment expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,231,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,093,409\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 778,328\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net barrels of oil sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,956\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22,825\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Mcf of gas sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 62,630\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 70,195\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Barrels of Oil Equivalent ( BOE\u201d) sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 29,394\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 34,524\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average price per barrel of oil sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41.00\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78.74\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average price for per Mcf of natural gas sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.30\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.14\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease operating expense per BOE\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25.66\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22.92\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DD&A per BOE\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27.78\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22.24\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur oil sales are primarily attributable to our properties in Kansas and Wyoming. The average realized oil price for 2015 and 2014 were $41.00 and $78.74 per barrel, respectively, a decrease of 47.9% or $37.74 per barrel and our oil sales volumes decreased 3,869 barrels or 17.0%, resulting in barrels sold of 18,956 compared to 22,825 in the prior year. These decreases in oil price and volumes negatively impacted our oil sales revenues by $1,020,107 compared to the prior year. The impact of the lower prices reduced our revenue by $861,476 and the lower volumes impacted revenue by $158,631. This decrease in our oil sales volumes is attributed to the natural decline of production in our wells and to the inclement weather in March, April and May of 2015, which made it difficult to get back to the tank batteries and pick up the oil to transport it to the market. The wells automatically shut-in once the tank batteries become full.\nThe average realized natural gas prices, including proceeds from sales of natural gas liquids, was $2.30 and $5.14 per Mcf for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and our natural gas sales volumes decreased from 70,195 mcf in 2014 to 62,630 mcf in 2015, resulting in a decrease of 7,565 mcf or 10.8%. The impact due to lower prices resulted in a decrease of natural gas revenues of $199,764, while the impact of lower sales volumes decreased revenue by $17,382.\nProduction taxes on a per BOE basis for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, decreased 52.9% compared to the prior year. We generally expect production tax expense to trend with oil, gas, and NGL production revenue. Product mix, the location of production, and incentives to encourage oil and gas development can all impact or change the amount of production tax we recognize. Production taxes as a percentage of revenue was 8.3% and 9.1% during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGas Gathering\nWe have owned and operated a natural gas gathering system (pipeline and compressor station) for coal bed methane properties in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming since 2006. We have had no revenues relating to this system since June 2011 due to low natural gas prices which resulted in all wells in the field being shut-in. While this field is shut-in we do continue to perform routine maintenance to ensure it is in a safe condition. Operating expenses for 2015 and 2014 were $1,406 and $8,926, respectively. At December 31, 2015, we wrote off the remaining book value of this asset by recording $56,648 of impairment expense.\nGeneral and Administrative\nPresented below is a summary of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Director fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,833\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,450\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,383\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investor relations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 28,128\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 65,833\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (37,705\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal, auditing and professional services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 116,078\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 146,581\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (30,503\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consulting and executive services:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Related parties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 172,217\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 220,800\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (48,583\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrelated parties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 74,634\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 72,807\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,827\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (142\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 439,318\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 527,041\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (87,723\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $87,723 for 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to decreases in investor relations, legal, auditing and professional fees and related party consulting services. Director fees increased by $27,383 and other administrative expenses increased slightly by 1,827. The increase in directors fees is related to shares issued to two board members for five years of service on the board and the addition of a new board member increasing the board from 5 seats to 6 seats.\nWe have an operating agreement with DNR, whereby executive level expertise for our existing and prospective oil and gas properties is provided for a monthly fee of $18,000. This monthly charge is allocated $10,000 to consulting and executive services and $8,000 is allocated to lease operating expense. DNR is an affiliate of Charles B. Davis, an executive officer and director of the Company.\nWe had a net loss for 2015 of $4,747,053 compared to net income of $62,369 for 2014. This decrease was primarily due to decreased revenues from lower oil and natural gas prices and volumes and a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $3.3 million recorded as impairment expense related to our oil and gas properties and gas gathering system. Depreciation, depletion & amortization increased approximately $48,000 due to a lower reserve base. These costs were offset slightly by lower lease operating costs, which decreased approximately $37,000 and lower production taxes, which are directly related to revenue, which decreased approximately $95,000.\nInterest expense decreased from $135,773 for 2014 to $111,910 for 2015. The decrease of $23,863 was due primarily to the pay down of principal on certain notes payable.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn order to execute our drilling plans and to be in a position to seek to acquire additional interests in oil and gas properties that meet our objectives, we need to obtain significant additional financing. Historically, we have used a line of credit, preferred stock offerings and sales of oil and gas properties in order to fund our operations. In late 2015, we raised approximately $1.7 million through a private placement of our Series A2 Preferred Stock to accredited investors only. Also, since 2011, we have sold various interests in some of our oil and gas properties, which have resulted in aggregate net proceeds from three sales of $6,377,000. We intend to continue to sell properties, but only those properties that can be liquidated at attractive prices. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate any proceeds from the sale of our properties or that we will successfully raise additional capital from sales of our equity.\nWe had a working capital deficit as of December 31, 2015 of approximately $1.4 million, compared to a working capital deficit of approximately $1.3 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in our deficit was primarily due to the payable due to DNR related to a settlement agreement of approximately $300,000 that was accrued as part of operator fees and other in current liabilities, an increase in our current obligation for our asset retirement obligations and certain notes payable that are due within 12 months. This was offset with higher current assets, primarily due to sales of preferred stock.\nWe used $96,890 in operating cash flow during the year ended 2015 compared to $658,919 generated through operating cash flow during the year ended 2014. This is primarily related to lower oil and natural gas prices and lower sales volumes, which resulted in lower revenues of approximately $1.6 million.\nDuring 2015 investing activities used net cash of approximately $1.1 million, which was attributed to an acquisition of oil and gas properties that we closed on December 30, 2015. We also had capital additions of $68,631, which was offset with proceeds received of $50,000 for the sale of one of our wells. During 2014, we generated net proceeds of approximately $313,000 from a participation agreement in an oil and gas property, which was offset with capital additions of $640,000, resulting in net cash used in investing activities of $326,470.\nWe had approximately $1.7 million of net cash provided by financing activities in 2015, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $778,000 in 2014. We borrowed $67,000 against our line of credit during the year, we made principal payments to certain notes payables of $25,568 and we raised $1,665,000 through our Series A2 Preferred Stock private placement. The 2014 financing activities included borrowings of approximately $623,000. These funds were needed to fund our operations, a redemption of Series A1 Preferred Stock of $15,500, repurchase of 1,200,000 shares of common stock for $228,000, and repayment of notes payable of $1,157,000.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no operating leases in place.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn connection with the related party acquisition of oil and gas properties in the third quarter of 2011, we acquired interests in certain geologic zones of the properties. This agreement contained several arrangements that would require us to pay certain amounts depending on certain thresholds met. However, on January 19, 2016, but effective December 31, 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Sellers of these properties, whereby in consideration of the amounts indicated below, the parties (i) terminated Exhibits C and C-2 to the DNR and Tindall PSA for all purposes; (ii) extinguished all liabilities of the Company under Exhibit C of the DNR and Tindall PSA including $250,000, related to the increase in oil prices after the acquisition; (iii) agreed that the promissory note owed by us to DNR in the amount of $792,151 and accrued interest thereon was paid in full; and (iv) released each other against any and all claims which have been raised or could have been raised among them. Specifically, Exhibits C and C-2 to the DNR and Tindall PSA related to potential payments that would have been needed to be made by us in the event oil prices increased to certain levels and related to certain payments that would have been needed to be made by us in the event we sold certain properties purchased under the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Exhibits C and C-2 were terminated and extinguished (including any amounts owed thereunder including $250,000 under Exhibit C to the Purchase and Sale Agreement) in exchange for 25 fully paid, nonassessable restricted shares of our 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock. Consideration to pay the above promissory note in full consisted of us issuing to DNR 65 fully paid, nonassessable restricted shares of our 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock, and paying DNR $303,329 in cash.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period ( ASU 2014-12\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2014-12 require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d ( ASC 718\u201d), as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. The amendments in ASU 2014-12 are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in ASU 2014-12 either: (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.\u201d ASU 2014-08 changes the criteria for reporting a discontinued operation. Under the new pronouncement, a disposal of a part of an organization that has a major effect on its operations and financial results is a discontinued operation. The Company is required to adopt ASU 2014-08 prospectively for all disposals or components of its business classified as held for sale during fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2014. The adoption of ASU 2014-08 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition,\u201d and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition- Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts.\u201d ASU 2014-09's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under today's guidance, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017 and, at that time, the Company may adopt the new standard under the full retrospective approach or the modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the method and impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 will explicitly require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosure in certain circumstances. The new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-15.\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued new authoritative accounting guidance requiring debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the related debt liability. This guidance is to be applied using a retrospective method and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This guidance eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments may be applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company does not expect this to impact its operating results or cash flows.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16 (ASU 2015-16): Business Combinations (Topic 805), effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period, to simplify the accounting for measurement-period adjustments for an acquirer in a business combination. ASU 2015-16 requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The acquirer is required to adjust its financial statements for the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2015-16 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on our financial position and results of operations.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB, or other standards-setting bodies, that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements upon adoption.\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> Item 8.\n</td> <td> FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAR\u00caTE INDUSTRIES, INC.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ar\u00eate Industries, Inc. at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Denver, Colorado\nMay 6, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n/s/ CAUSEY DEMGEN & MOORE P.C.\n</td>

Financial Statements.\nAR\u00caTE INDUSTRIES, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\n 1. Organization and Nature of Operations \nAr\u00eate Industries, Inc. ( Ar\u00eate\u201d or the Company\u201d), is a Colorado corporation that was incorporated on July 21, 1987. The Company is in the business of exploration for and production of oil and natural gas. The Company's primary area of oil exploration and production is in Colorado, Montana, Kansas, and Wyoming.\nThe Company seeks to focus on acquiring interests in traditional exploratory and development oil and gas ventures, and seek properties that offer profit potential from overlooked and by-passed reserves of oil and natural gas, which may include shut-in wells, in-field development, stripper wells, enhanced recovery, re-completion and re-working projects. In addition, the Company's strategy includes the purchase and sale of acreage prospective for oil and natural gas and seeking to obtain cash flow from the sale and farm out of such prospects.\n 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of the Company's financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make various assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes in these assumptions, judgments and estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events and, accordingly, actual results could differ from amounts initially established.\nThe most significant areas requiring the use of assumptions, judgments and estimates relate to the volumes of natural gas and oil reserves used in calculating depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d), the amount of expected future cash flows used in determining possible impairments of oil and gas properties and the amount of future capital costs used in these calculations. Assumptions, judgments and estimates also are required in determining future asset retirement obligations, impairments of undeveloped properties, and in valuing stock-based payment awards.\nThe only component of comprehensive income that is applicable to the Company is net income (loss). Accordingly, a separate statement of comprehensive income (loss) is not included in these financial statements.\nCash Equivalents\nFor purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers cash and all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company's receivables consist mainly of trade account receivables from working interests in oil and gas production from partners with interests in common properties. Collectability is dependent upon the financial wherewithal of each entity and is influenced by the general economic conditions of the oil and gas industry. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts on a case by case basis once there is evidence that collection is not probable.\nGas Gathering System, Furniture and Equipment\nThe Company's gas gathering system and its furniture and equipment are stated at cost. Material expenditures that increase the life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs is charged to operating expenses as incurred. Upon disposal of an asset, the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gains or losses will be reflected in current operations. For the gas gathering system, depreciation is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of ten years. Depreciation of furniture and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of five years. At December 31, 2015, the Company wrote this asset off by recording an impairment charge against the gas gathering system of $56,648. Furniture and equipment was fully depreciated at December 31, 2015.\nOil and Gas Producing Activities\nThe Company's oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the well has proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not result in proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the Statements of Cash Flows. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive. Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized.\nOther exploration costs, including certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases, are charged to expense as incurred. The sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit-of-production DD&A rate. A gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of proved properties and is classified in other operating revenues. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, and renewals and betterments are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts.\nUnevaluated oil and gas property costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties if the properties are subsequently determined to be productive. Proceeds from sales of partial interests in unproved leases are accounted for as a recovery of cost without recognizing any gain until all costs are recovered. Unevaluated oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on a property-by-property basis based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance, commodity price outlooks or future plans to develop acreage.\nThe Company reviews its proved oil and gas properties for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. The Company estimates the expected undiscounted future cash flows of its oil and gas properties and compares such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, the present value of estimated future cash flows, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected. Once incurred, a write-down may not be reversed in a later period. At December 31, 2015, the Company recorded impairment against its oil and gas properties in the amount of $3,231,000 due to the sustained decline in oil prices in 2015 and forecasts for future prices. There was no impairment at December 31, 2014.\nThe provision for DD&A of oil and gas properties is calculated based on proved reserves on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method. Natural gas is converted to barrel equivalents, BOE, at the rate of six Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of oil. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, which are net of estimated salvage values, are taken into consideration.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe estimated fair value of the future costs associated with dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of oil and gas properties is recorded generally upon acquisition or completion of a well. The net estimated costs are discounted to present values using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate over the estimated economic life of the oil and gas properties. Such costs are capitalized as part of the related asset. The asset is depleted on the units-of-production method on a field-by-field basis. The associated liability is classified in current and long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The liability is periodically adjusted to reflect (1) new liabilities incurred, (2) liabilities settled during the period, (3) accretion expense and (4) revisions to estimated future cash flow requirements. The accretion expense is recorded as a component of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 8 - Asset Retirement Obligation.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenues from the sale of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids ( NGL\u201d) when delivery to the purchaser has occurred and title has transferred. The Company uses the sales method to account for gas imbalances. Under this method, revenue is recorded on the basis of gas actually sold by the Company. In addition, the Company will record revenue for its share of gas sold by other owners that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves. The Company also reduces revenue for other owners' gas sold by the Company that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves. The Company's remaining over and under produced gas balancing positions are considered in the Company's proved oil and gas reserves. Gas imbalances at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were not material.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nEnvironmental expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are expensed. Liabilities are accrued when environmental assessments and/or clean-ups are probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had not accrued for nor been fined or cited for any environmental violations that would have a material adverse effect upon capital expenditures, operating results or the competitive position of the Company.\nIndustry Segment and Geographic Information\nThe Company operates in one industry segment, which is the exploration, development and production of natural gas and crude oil, and all of the Company's operations are conducted in the continental United States. Consequently, the Company currently reports as a single industry segment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company did not grant any stock options or warrants during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and no options or warrants were outstanding at any time during these years. The Company has issued shares of common stock for services performed by officers, directors and unrelated parties during 2015 and 2014. The Company has recorded these transactions based on the value of the services or the value of the common stock, whichever is more readily determinable.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are reported in accordance with GAAP, which requires the establishment of deferred tax accounts for all temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using currently enacted federal and state income tax rates. In addition, deferred tax accounts must be adjusted to reflect new rates if enacted.\nRealization of deferred tax assets is contingent on the generation of future taxable income. As a result, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will be realized during periods when they are available, and if not, management provides a valuation allowance for amounts not likely to be recognized.\nManagement periodically evaluates tax reporting methods to determine if any uncertain tax positions exist that would require the establishment of a loss contingency. A loss contingency would be recognized if it were probable that a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nCash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and notes payable are carried in the Consolidated Financial Statements in amounts which approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and revenue receivables. The Company periodically maintains cash balances at a commercial bank in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit of $250,000. At December 31, 2015, the Company's uninsured cash balance was $271,666. The Company received 82% and 84% of its oil and gas production revenue from two purchasers during fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe concentration of credit risk in the oil and gas industry affects the overall exposure to credit risk because customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and other dilutive securities. The only potentially dilutive securities for the diluted earnings per share calculations consist of Series A2 preferred stock that is convertible into common stock at an exchange price of $2.00 per common share. As of December 31, 2015, the convertible preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation preference of $2,670,000 and was convertible to 1,335,000 shares of common stock. These shares were excluded from the earnings per share calculation because they would be anti-dilutive. All of the Series A1 preferred stock was redeemed during the year ended December 31, 2014, therefore, there was no outstanding preferred stock at December 31, 2014.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) available to common shareholder's - Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,747,053\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,945\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Plus: Preferred stock dividends\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) available to common shareholder's - Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,747,053\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,945\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,882,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,450,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Dilutive effect of stock options\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add: Dilutive effect of preferred stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average common shares outstanding - Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,882,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,450,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) per common share:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.37\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.01\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.37\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.01\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period ( ASU 2014-12\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2014-12 require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d ( ASC 718\u201d), as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. The amendments in ASU 2014-12 are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in ASU 2014-12 either: (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.\u201d ASU 2014-08 changes the criteria for reporting a discontinued operation. Under the new pronouncement, a disposal of a part of an organization that has a major effect on its operations and financial results is a discontinued operation. The Company is required to adopt ASU 2014-08 prospectively for all disposals or components of its business classified as held for sale during fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2014. The adoption of ASU 2014-08 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition,\u201d and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition- Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts.\u201d ASU 2014-09's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under today's guidance, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017 and, at that time, the Company may adopt the new standard under the full retrospective approach or the modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the method and impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 will explicitly require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosure in certain circumstances. The new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-15.\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued new authoritative accounting guidance requiring debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the related debt liability. This guidance is to be applied using a retrospective method and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This guidance eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments may be applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company does not expect this to impact its operating results or cash flows.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16 (ASU 2015-16): Business Combinations (Topic 805), effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period, to simplify the accounting for measurement-period adjustments for an acquirer in a business combination. ASU 2015-16 requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The acquirer is required to adjust its financial statements for the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2015-16 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on our financial position and results of operations.\n 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Oil and Gas Properties \nAcquisitions\nIn 2011, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement ( DNR and Tindall PSA\u201d) and other related agreements and documents with Tucker Family Investments, LLLP, which we refer to as Tucker\u201d; DNR Oil & Gas, Inc. which we refer to as DNR\u201d; and Tindall Operating Company, which we refer to as Tindall\u201d, and collectively we refer to these parties as the Sellers\u201d, for the purchase of certain oil and gas operating properties in Colorado, Kansas, Wyoming, and Montana. DNR is owned primarily by an officer and director of the Company, Charles B. Davis, and he is an affiliate of Tucker and Tindall. The consideration for the purchase was determined by bargaining between management of the Company and Mr. Davis, and the Company used reports of independent engineering firms to analyze the purchase price. The base purchase price was paid in full on September 29, 2011.\nOn January 19, 2016, but effective December 31, 2015, (the \"Effective Date\") we entered into a Settlement Agreement with Tucker, DNR and Tindall regarding the DNR and Tindall PSA and other related matters. In consideration of the amounts indicated below, the parties (i) terminated Exhibits C and C-2 to the DNR and Tindall PSA for all purposes; (ii) extinguished all liabilities of the Company under Exhibit C of the DNR and Tindall PSA including $250,000 related to the increase in oil prices after the acquisition; (iii) agreed that the promissory note of $792,151 due to DNR (See Note 5 - Notes and Advances Payable) and accrued interest thereon was paid in full; and (iv) released each other against any and all claims which have been raised or could have been raised among them. Specifically, Exhibits C and C-2 to the DNR and Tindall PSA related to potential payments that would have needed to have been made by the us in the event oil prices increased to certain levels and related to certain payments to have been made by us in the event we sold certain properties purchased under the DNR and Tindall PSA. Exhibits C and C-2 were terminated and extinguished (including any amounts owed thereunder including $250,000 under Exhibit C to the DNR and Tindall PSA) in exchange for 25 fully paid nonassessable restricted shares of our 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock. Consideration to pay the above promissory note in full consisted of the issuance to DNR of 65 fully paid, nonassessable restricted shares of its 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock, and paying DNR $303,329 in cash. A description of the terms of the 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock, including its terms of conversion into shares of the Company's common stock is set forth in Note 4 below. The Company recorded an expense of $141,099 included in other operating expense in the statement of operations as a result of this transaction.\nOn December 30, 2015, the Company completed an asset acquisition pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement executed on November 25, 2015, but effective December 1, 2015 (the \"Wellstar Purchase and Sale Agreement \") with Wellstar Corporation (the \"Seller\"), an unaffiliated corporation. The assets acquired were producing oil and gas leases in Sumner County, Kansas and Kimball County, Nebraska (collectively, the \"Properties\" and individually, the \"Padgett Properties\" and the \"Nebraska Properties\"). The Company acquired 51% of Seller's interest (ranging from 47% to 100% of the working interests) in the Padgett Properties and acquired 100% of the Seller's interest (100% of the working interests) in the Nebraska Properties for aggregate consideration of $1,100,000 and the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of the Company's restricted common stock valued at $0.10 per share at the date of closing, or $100,000.\nThe table below presents the purchase price allocation for the Wellstar Purchase and Sale Agreement:\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> Purchase Price allocation:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,100,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common Stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Consideration\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,200,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil and gas properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,404,493\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset retirement obligation assumed\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (204,493\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Purchase price allocation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,200,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPro-Forma information acquisition (unaudited)\nThe table below reflects unaudited pro forma results as if the acquisition of oil and gas properties had taken place as of January 1, 2014:\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,294,069\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,384,674\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,773,679\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 455,736\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,773,679\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 464,312\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.34\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.03\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.34\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.03\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe unaudited pro forma data gives effect to the actual operating results of the acquired properties prior to the acquisition, adjusted to include the pro forma effect of depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion based on the purchase price of the properties.\n 4.

The Company recorded impairment expense of $3,037,000 and $194,000 against proved and unevaluated oil and gas properties, respectively at December 31, 2015. There was no impairment expense during fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.\n 5. Fair Value Measurements \nFASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d, establishes a framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under FASB ASC 820 are described as follows:\n - Level 1 - Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets, for substantially identical assets and liabilities. \n - Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 for similar assets and liabilities. These include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. If the asset or liability has a specified or contractual term, the input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \n - Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, generally requiring a significant amount of judgment by management. The assets or liabilities fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. \nThe methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Further, although the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nUpon completion of wells, the Company records an asset retirement obligation at fair value using Level 3 assumptions.\nNonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis upon impairment. The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Company's assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Level 3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net Book Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Pre-tax\n(Non-cash)\nImpairment Loss\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proved oil and gas properties at cost, net of impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 315,138\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,386,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,071,447 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unevaluated oil and gas properties at cost, net of impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 154,783\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>314,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,553 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gas gathering system (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,648 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The gas gathering system was written off entirely at December 31, 2015.\nThe fair values of the properties were determined using discounted cash flow models. The discounted cash flows were based on management's expectations for the future. The inputs included estimates of future crude oil and natural gas production, commodity prices based on sales contracted terms or commodity price curves as of the date of the estimate, estimated operating and development costs, as a risk-adjusted discount rate of 10%.\nThe carrying amounts of other financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, account payables, accrued liabilities and long term debt in our balance sheet approximates fair value as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nStockholders' Equity\nCommon Stock\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company purchased an option to acquire rights in minerals owned by William W. Stewart (related party) for 150,000 shares of common stock valued at $34,500.\nOn January 30, 2014, the Company entered into a Direct Stock Purchase Agreement with Burlingame Equity Investors II L.P. and Burlingame Equity Investors Master Fund, L.P., whereby the Company purchased an aggregate 1,200,000 shares of its common stock from these entities at a price of $0.19 per share for total consideration of $228,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued 736,954 shares of common stock as compensation for services; 480,288 shares of common stock were issued for board services ranging in value from $0.10 to $0.20 per share and 256,666 shares of common stock were issued for consulting services provided by three related parties ranging in value from $0.10 to $0.16 per share.\nThe Company issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock valued at $0.10 per share or $100,000 related to the Wellstar Purchase and Sale Agreement that was executed on December 30, 2015. See Note 3 - Acquisitions, for additional information regarding this transaction.\nPreferred Stock\nOn September 29, 2011, the Company completed a private placement of its Series A1 Preferred Stock which resulted in the issuance of 522.5 shares for gross proceeds of $5,225,000.\nEffective June 28, 2013, several holders of the Company's Series A1 Convertible Preferred Stock elected to convert shares of such stock into the Company's common stock at a redemption price of $0.75 per common share. In connection with those redemptions all such holders agreed to waive all dividend rights on their shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock subsequent to March 30, 2013. Information regarding the conversions is set forth below.\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nName of Holder\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of Shares of Series\nA1 Preferred Stock Converted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of\nCommon Shares Issued\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Burlingame Equity Investors II, LP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Burlingame Equity Investors Master Fund, LP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,159,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Charles B.

See additional discussion of the note below in Note 5 - Notes and Advances Payable.\nOn December 11, 2015, the Company began a private placement of its Series A2 7% Preferred Convertible Stock with a maximum amount of 600 shares at $10,000 per share or $6,000,000. At December 31, 2015, the Company had sold subscriptions equal to $1,750,000 (175 shares) and issued to DNR 90 shares fully paid ($900,000), nonassessable restricted shares of its 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock as part of the consideration for a settlement agreement entered into with DNR (See Note 5 - Advances and Notes Payable for details of the settlement).\nThe following are the terms of the Preferred Stock Series A2:\nAuthorized Shares, Stated Value and Liquidation Preference. Six hundred shares are designated as the Series A2 7% Convertible Preferred Stock, which has a stated value and liquidation preference of $10,000 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends.\nRanking. The Series A2 Preferred Stock will rank senior to future classes or series of preferred stock established after the issue date of the Series A2 Preferred Stock, unless the Company's Board of Directors expressly provides otherwise when establishing a future class or series. The Series A2 Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company's common stock but it is junior to the Company's outstanding debt and accounts payable.\nDividends. Holders of Series A2 Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends at an annual rate of 7.0% of the $10,000 per share liquidation preference, payable quarterly on each of March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31. Dividends are payable in cash or in shares of common stock (at its then fair market value), at the Company's election.\nVoting Rights. Holders of the Series A2 Preferred Stock will vote together with the holders of the Company's common stock as a single class on all matters upon which the holders of common stock are entitled to vote. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to such number of votes as the number of shares of common stock into which such share of Preferred Stock is convertible; however, solely for the purpose of determining such number of votes, the conversion price per share will be deemed to be $2.00, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustment. In addition, the holders of the Series A2 Preferred Stock will vote as a separate class with respect to certain matters, including amendments to the Company's Articles of Incorporation that alter the voting powers, preferences and special rights of the Series A2 Preferred Stock.\nLiquidation. In the event we voluntarily or involuntarily liquidate, dissolve or wind up, the holders of the Series A2 Preferred Stock will be entitled, before any distribution or payment out of the Company's assets may be made to or set aside for the holders of any of the Company's junior capital stock and subject to the rights of the Company's creditors, to receive a liquidation distribution in an amount equal to $10,000 per share, plus any unpaid dividends. A merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's property or business is not deemed to be a liquidation for purposes of the preceding sentence.\nRedemption by the Company. The Series A2 Preferred Stock is redeemable in whole or in part at the Company's option at any time for cash. The redemption price is equal to $10,000 per share, plus any unpaid dividends.\nOptional Redemption by Holder. Unless prohibited by Colorado law governing distributions to shareholders, the Company, upon 90 days' prior written request from any holders of outstanding shares of Series A2 Preferred Stock, in its sole discretion, may redeem at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) $10,000 per share and (ii) the accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date, up to one-third of each holder's outstanding shares of Series A2 Preferred Stock on: (i) the first anniversary of the Original Issue Date (the \"First Redemption Date\"), (ii) the second anniversary of the Original Issue Date (the \"Second Redemption Date\") and (iii) the third anniversary of the Original Issue Date (the \"Third Redemption Date\", along with the First Redemption Date and the Second Redemption Date, collectively, each a \"Redemption Date\"). If on any Redemption Date, Colorado law governing distributions to shareholders prevents the Company from redeeming all shares of Series A2 Preferred Stock to be redeemed, the Company may ratably redeem the maximum number of shares that it may redeem consistent with such law, and may also redeem the remaining shares as soon as it may lawfully do so under such law.\nPreemptive Rights. Holders of the Series A2 Preferred Stock do not have preemptive rights.\nMandatory Conversion. Each share of Series A2 Preferred Stock remaining outstanding will automatically be converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon the earlier of (i) any closing of underwritten public offering by us of shares of common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, in which the aggregate cash proceeds to be received by us and selling stockholders (if any) from such offering (without deducting underwriting discounts, expenses and commissions) are at least $7,000,000, and per share sales price is at least $3.00 (such price to be adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits or (ii) the date agreed to by written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series A2 Preferred Stock.\nOptional Conversion by Investors. At any time, each holder of Series A2 Preferred Stock has the right, at the holder's option, to convert all or any portion of such holder's Series A2 Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $2.00 per share prior to the mandatory conversion of the Series A2 Preferred Stock.\n 7.

The Company also agreed to assign 75% of its operating income from its oil and gas operations and any lease or well sale or any other assets sales to Apex to secure the debt. Apex is 100% owned by the CEO, director, and shareholder of the Company, Nicholas L. Scheidt. The Company borrowed the full amount of principal on the note, and also paid a loan fee of $10,000. In the event of default on the note and failure to cure the default in ten days, Apex may accelerate payment and the annual interest rate on the note will accrue at 18%. Default includes failure to pay the note when due or if the Company borrows any other monies or offers security in the Company or in the collateral securing the note prior to the note being paid in full. The outstanding principal balance as of December 31, 2015, was $120,728. \n (2) On January 28, 2014, we entered into a line of credit loan agreement for $1,500,000 due January 15, 2015 extended to January 28, 2016, and further extended after December 31, 2015 to May 28, 2016.

The amount eligible for borrowing on the Credit Facility is limited to the lesser of (i) 65% of the Company's PV10 value of its carbon reserves based upon the most current engineering reserve report or (ii) 48 month cumulative cash flow based upon the most current engineering reserve report. In addition to the borrowing base limitation, the Company is required to maintain and meet certain affirmative and negative covenants and conditions in order to draw advances on the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains certain representations, warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Company, which are customarily applicable to senior secured loan facilities. Key covenants include limitations on indebtedness, restricted payments, creation of liens on oil and gas properties, hedging transactions, mergers and consolidations, sales of assets, use of loan proceeds, change in business, and change in control. The above-referenced promissory note contains customary default and acceleration provisions and provides for a default interest rate of 21% per annum. In addition, the Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including: (a) failure to pay any obligations when due; (b) failure to comply with certain restrictive covenants; (c) false or misleading representations or warranties; (d) defaults of other indebtedness; (e) specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings; (f) one or more final, non-appealable judgments in excess of $50,000 that is not covered by insurance; (g) change in control (25% threshold); (h) negative events affecting the Guarantor; and (i) lender in good faith believes itself insecure.

Actual income tax benefit (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 differs from the amounts computed using the federal statutory tax rate of 34%, as follows:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit (expense) at the statutory rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,614,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (21,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit (expense) resulting from:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in Federal valuation allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,884,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other permanent differences\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 270,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Utilization of net operating loss carryforwards\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below:\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Federal net operating loss carryforwards\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,030,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,465,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State net operating loss carryforwards\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 315,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 264,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil and gas properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 917,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (222,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 371,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 241,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net deferred tax assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,632,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,748,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less valuation allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,632,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,748,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net deferred tax assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA valuation allowance has been recorded for all deferred tax assets since the more likely than not\u201d realization criterion was not met as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nA tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized if it is more likely than not\u201d that the position is sustainable based solely on its technical merits. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits and management is not aware of any issues that would cause a significant increase to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next year. The Company's policy is to recognize any interest or penalties as a component of income tax expense. The Company's material taxing jurisdictions are comprised of the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the states of Colorado, Wyoming and Kansas. The tax years 2010 through 2015 remain open to examination by these taxing jurisdictions.\n 10. Asset Retirement Obligations \nThe Company follows accounting for asset retirement obligations ( ARO\u201d) in accordance with ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it was incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The Company's ARO primarily represents the estimated present value of the amounts expected to be incurred to plug, abandon and remediate producing and shut-in wells at the end of their productive lives in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. The Company determines the estimated fair value of its ARO by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to plugging and abandonment liabilities. The significant inputs used to calculate such liabilities include estimates of costs to be incurred; the Company's credit adjusted discount rates, inflation rates and estimated dates of abandonment. The ARO is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized asset retirement costs are amortized using the unit of production method.\nA reconciliation of the Company's ARO for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, beginning of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 749,013\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 682,203\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Liabilities incurred upon acquisition of properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 204,493\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Liabilities settled\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (28,684\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 70,375\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 66,810\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revisions of prior estimates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance, end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 995,197\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 749,013\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less current asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (409,621\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (191,843\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 585,576\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 557,170\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 11. Commitments and Contingencies \nLease commitments. The Company entered into a lease for property access rights and compressor space in Wyoming related to the Company's natural gas gathering system. The expense in 2015 and 2014 was approximately $1,400 and $9,000, which is included in gas gathering operating costs. The Company used office space and conference room space provided by a director for an annual charge of $3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company does not have any operating leases in place at December 31, 2015.\nLegal Proceedings. The Company is subject to the risk of litigation, claims and assessments that may arise in the ordinary course of its business activities, including contractual matters and regulatory proceedings. As of December 31, 2015, the Company was not subject to any pending litigation and management is not currently aware of any asserted or unasserted claims and assessments that may impact the Company's future results of operations.\n 12.

The Company believes such information is essential for a proper understanding and assessment of the data presented.\nAs of December 31, 2014, future cash inflows were computed by applying the SEC-mandated 12 month arithmetic average of the first of month price for January through December of 2014, which resulted in benchmark prices of $94.99 per barrel for crude oil and $4.35 per MMbtu for natural gas. Prices were further adjusted for transportation, quality and basis differentials, which resulted in an average price used as of December 31, 2014, of $84.09 per barrel of oil and $6.09 per Mcf for natural gas.\nAs of December 31, 2015, future cash inflows were computed by applying the SEC-mandated 12 month arithmetic average of the first of month price for January through December of 2015, which resulted in benchmark prices of $50.28 per barrel for crude oil and $2.587 per MMbtu for natural gas. Prices were further adjusted for transportation, quality and basis differentials, which resulted in a difference from the benchmark prices ranging from -$3.40 per barrel to -$10.77 per barrel, depending on the location of the wells. The calculated natural gas differentials ranged from -81% to +59% as a percentage of the benchmark prices depending on where the well was located.\nThe assumptions used to compute estimated future cash inflows do not necessarily reflect the Company's expectations of actual revenues or costs, nor their present worth. In addition, variations from the expected production rate also could result directly or indirectly from factors outside of the Company's control, such as unexpected delays in development, changes in prices or regulatory or environmental policies. The reserve valuation further assumes that all reserves will be disposed of by production. However, if reserves are sold in place, additional economic considerations could also affect the amount of cash eventually realized.\nFuture development and production costs are computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions.\nFuture income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already legislated, to the future pre-tax net cash flows relating to the Company's proved oil and gas reserves. Net operating losses incurred in oil and gas producing activities are utilized to reduce taxable income. Permanent differences in oil and gas related tax credits and allowances are recognized, if reasonably estimable.\nA 10% annual discount rate was used to reflect the timing of the future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves. The following table presents the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2013 and 2014:\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Future cash inflows\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,002,030\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,132,987\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Future production costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (7,976,560\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9,732,541\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Future development costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (781,442\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Future income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,905,627\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Future net cash flows\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,025,470\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,713,377\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10% annual discount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,472,800\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,724,250\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,552,670\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,989,127\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe present value (at a 10% annual discount) of future net cash flows from the Company's proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of its estimated oil and gas reserves. The Company bases the estimated discounted future net cash flows from its proved reserves on average prices realized in the preceding year and on costs in effect at the end of the year. However, actual future net cash flows from the Company's oil and gas properties will also be affected by factors such as actual prices the Company receives for oil and gas, the amount and timing of actual production, supply of and demand for oil and gas and changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both the Company's production and incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% annual discount factor the Company uses when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the Company or the oil and gas industry in general.\nA summary of changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is as follows for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014:\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, beginning of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,989,127\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,154,647\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales of oil and gas, net of production costs and taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23,891\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,190,850\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchases of reserves in place\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 589,190\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales of reserves in place\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in development costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (699,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 98,054\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revisions of previous estimates\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (440,871\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 213,112\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in prices and production costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,661,912\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (341,335\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net changes in income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,153,332\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 440,034\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion of discount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 598,913\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 615,465\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,552,670\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,989,127\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n Item 9.

As defined under Sections 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, the term disclosure controls and procedures\u201d means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including the Certifying Officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Certifying Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by our management on a timely basis in order to comply with the disclosure requirements under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO\u201d) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following material weaknesses.\n \u2022 We have not developed and effectively communicated our accounting policies and procedures, and \n \u2022 Our controls over financial statement disclosures were determined to be ineffective. \nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nThe annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit smaller reporting companies to provide only management's report in this annual report\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the latest fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> Item 9B.\n</td> <td> OTHER INFORMATION\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNot Applicable.\nPART III\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> Item 10.\n</td> <td> Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe directors named below were elected for one-year terms.

The Company also agreed to assign 75% of its operating income from its oil and gas operations and any lease or well sale or any other assets sales to Apex to secure the debt. Apex is 100% owned by the CEO, director, and shareholder of the Company, Nicholas L. Scheidt. The Company borrowed the full amount of principal on the note, and also paid a loan fee of $10,000. In the event of default on the note and failure to cure the default in ten days, Apex may accelerate payment and the annual interest rate on the note will accrue at 18%. Default includes failure to pay the note when due or if the Company borrows any other monies or offers security in the Company or in the collateral securing the note prior to the note being paid in full.

The DNR note matures on January 1, 2019. On January 19, 2016, but effective December 31, 2015, (the \"Effective Date\") we entered into a Settlement Agreement with DNR and Tindall Operating Company discussed above under which the DNR Note was deemed paid in full. \n (4) On March 28, 2012, the Company executed a Promissory Note with Fairfield Management Group, LLC ( Fairfield\u201d), a related party. The note accrues interest at 7.5%, payable monthly and had a maturity date of March 31, 2016. During 2015 Fairfield assigned this note to Donald W. Prosser (former CFO and Director). Subsequent to December 31, 2015, the parties extended the due date to March 31, 2017. \nWe had related party payables of accrued interest to the officers and directors above of $10,825 at December 31, 2015.\nDue to the need of additional assistance with respect to corporate matters and operational needs, in October, 2014, we entered into a Consulting Agreement with William W.

For his consulting services, we paid Mr. Stewart a monthly cash retainer of $3,000 per month. In addition, the Company agreed to issue Mr. Stewart 40,000 restricted shares (the Restricted Shares\u201d) of the Company's common stock, which are subject to vesting in increments of 5,000 per month. He was paid a total of $15,000 and was issued a total of 40,000 shares of common stock under this agreement in 2015.\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td> Item 14.\n</td> <td> PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following relate to aggregate fees billed for the last two fiscal years by the Company's principal accountants concerning the Company's: (1) audit; (2) for assurance and services reasonably related to the audit; (3) for tax compliance, advice, and planning; and (4) for other fees provided by the principal accountant for the following:\n1.

All services performed by Causey Demgen and Moore, P.C. in 2015 and 2014 were pre-approved by our Audit Committee. Having considered whether the provision of the auditors' services other than for the annual audit and quarterly reviews is compatible with its independence, the Audit Committee has concluded that it is.\nThe Audit Committee on an annual basis reviews audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditors. All audit and non-audit services are pre-approved by the Audit Committee, which considers, among other things, the possible effect of the performance of such services on the auditors' independence. All requests for services to be provided by the independent auditor, which must include a description of the services to be rendered and the amount of corresponding fees, are submitted to the Chief Executive or Financial Officer. The Chief Executive or Financial Officer authorizes services that have been pre-approved by the Audit Committee. If there is any question as to whether a proposed service fits within a pre-approved service, the Audit Committee chair is consulted for a determination. The Chief Executive or Financial Officer submits requests or applications to provide services that have not been pre-approved by the Audit Committee, which must include an affirmation by the Chief Executive or Financial Officer and the independent auditor that the request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, to the Audit Committee (or its chair or any of its other members pursuant to delegated authority) for approval.\n(ii) 100 per cent of the fees billed by the principal accountant were approved by the Audit Committee (described in paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X).\n6.

For the past few years we have obtained loans, primarily from related parties, and incurred significant operating payables.\nIn the third quarter of 2011, we completed an acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in Montana, Wyoming, Colorado and Kansas. These properties include proved undeveloped and probable drilling opportunities. However, due to our working capital deficit discussed above, our primary challenge is to obtain additional financing to primarily address the significant working capital deficit and secondarily to seek to exploit existing drilling opportunities and possibly to acquire additional properties. We have sold some of these properties while retaining overriding royalty interests for future upside upon further development of the properties. In addition, from time to time we review opportunities for the purchase of production and underdeveloped oil and gas leases for future development. In order to purchase properties or begin substantive drilling activities we must obtain additional financing, which cannot be assured. We rely heavily on the skills of our board members in the areas of business development, capital acquisition, corporate visibility, oil and gas development, geology and operations.\nThere are no assurances that we can resolve our pressing capital needs, and although we have revenue from operations, our ability to execute our plans will still be dependent on our ability to raise additional capital. Our operating cash flow is dependent on the prices for crude oil. We also have a line of credit for $1,500,000 of which we have drawn $616,105.\nWhile we seek to reduce the amount of our variable costs on an ongoing basis, it is difficult to reduce or offset our fixed expenses related to being a public company, such as legal, accounting, transfer agent fees, reporting, corporate governance, and shareholder communications. We also incur cash costs for the due diligence, reserve studies, audits, and legal cost for any proposed acquisitions of oil and gas properties.\nOur future expectation is that monthly operating expenses will remain as low as possible until we can raise additional capital to address our working capital deficit.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company has identified the accounting policies described below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of the Company's results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the Company's business operations is discussed throughout this section where such policies affect the Company's reported and expected financial results. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities of the Company, revenues and expenses of the Company during the reporting period, and contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Company's consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that the actual results will not differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe record revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGL's and crude oil when delivery to the purchaser has occurred and title has transferred. We use the sales method to account for gas imbalances. Under this method, revenue is recorded on the basis of gas actually sold by us. In addition, we record revenue for our share of gas sold by other owners that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves. Our remaining over- and under-produced gas balancing positions are considered in our proved oil and gas reserves. Gas imbalances at December 31, 2014 and 2015 were not material.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make various assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes in these assumptions, judgments and estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events and, accordingly, actual results could differ from amounts initially established.\nThe most significant areas requiring the use of assumptions, judgments and estimates relate to the volumes of natural gas and oil reserves used in calculating depreciation, depletion and amortization, which we refer to as DD&A, the amount of expected future cash flows used in determining possible impairments of oil and gas properties and the amount of future capital costs used in these calculations. Assumptions, judgments and estimates also are required in determining future asset retirement obligations, impairments of undeveloped properties, and in valuing stock-based payment awards.\nOil and Gas Producing Activities\nIn January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which we refer to as the FASB, issued authoritative oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure guidance that was effective for the Company beginning in 2010. This guidance was issued to align the accounting oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with the requirements in the SEC final rule, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting\u201d, which was also effective in 2010.\nOur oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not find proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the Statements of Cash Flows. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive. Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized.\nOther exploration costs, including certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases, are charged to expense as incurred. The sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit-of-production DD&A rate. A gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of proved properties and is classified in other operating revenues. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, and renewals and betterments are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts.\nUnevaluated oil and gas property costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties if the properties are subsequently determined to be productive. Proceeds from sales of partial interests in unproved leases are accounted for as a recovery of cost without recognizing any gain until all costs are recovered. Unevaluated oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on a property-by-property basis based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance, commodity price outlooks and future plans to develop acreage.\nWe review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. We estimate the expected undiscounted future cash flows of our oil and gas properties and compare such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, the present value of estimated future cash flows, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected.\nThe provision for DD&A of oil and gas properties is calculated on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method. Natural gas is converted to barrel equivalents, BOE, at the rate of six Mcf to one barrel of oil. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, which are net of estimated salvage values, are taken into consideration.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe estimated fair value of the future costs associated with dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of oil and gas properties is recorded generally upon acquisition or completion of a well. The net estimated costs are discounted to present values using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate over the estimated economic life of the oil and gas properties. Such costs are capitalized as part of the related asset. The asset is depleted on the units-of-production method on a field-by-field basis. The associated liability is classified in current and long-term liabilities in the Balance Sheets. The liability is periodically adjusted to reflect (1) new liabilities incurred, (2) liabilities settled during the period, (3) accretion expense and (4) revisions to estimated future cash flow requirements. The accretion expense is recorded as a component of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe did not grant any stock options or warrants during 2015 and 2014 and no options or warrants were outstanding at any time during these years. We have issued shares of common stock for services performed by officers, directors and unrelated parties during 2015 and 2014. We have recorded these transactions based on the value of the services or the value of the common stock, whichever is more readily determinable.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nPresented below is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nOil and Gas Producing Activities\nIn 2011, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement which resulted in our acquisition of producing oil and gas properties in Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas and Montana. Presented below is a summary of our oil and gas operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nOur oil sales are primarily attributable to our properties in Kansas and Wyoming. The average realized oil price for 2015 and 2014 were $41.00 and $78.74 per barrel, respectively, a decrease of 47.9% or $37.74 per barrel and our oil sales volumes decreased 3,869 barrels or 17.0%, resulting in barrels sold of 18,956 compared to 22,825 in the prior year. These decreases in oil price and volumes negatively impacted our oil sales revenues by $1,020,107 compared to the prior year. The impact of the lower prices reduced our revenue by $861,476 and the lower volumes impacted revenue by $158,631. This decrease in our oil sales volumes is attributed to the natural decline of production in our wells and to the inclement weather in March, April and May of 2015, which made it difficult to get back to the tank batteries and pick up the oil to transport it to the market. The wells automatically shut-in once the tank batteries become full.\nThe average realized natural gas prices, including proceeds from sales of natural gas liquids, was $2.30 and $5.14 per Mcf for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and our natural gas sales volumes decreased from 70,195 mcf in 2014 to 62,630 mcf in 2015, resulting in a decrease of 7,565 mcf or 10.8%. The impact due to lower prices resulted in a decrease of natural gas revenues of $199,764, while the impact of lower sales volumes decreased revenue by $17,382.\nProduction taxes on a per BOE basis for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, decreased 52.9% compared to the prior year. We generally expect production tax expense to trend with oil, gas, and NGL production revenue. Product mix, the location of production, and incentives to encourage oil and gas development can all impact or change the amount of production tax we recognize. Production taxes as a percentage of revenue was 8.3% and 9.1% during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nGas Gathering\nWe have owned and operated a natural gas gathering system (pipeline and compressor station) for coal bed methane properties in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming since 2006. We have had no revenues relating to this system since June 2011 due to low natural gas prices which resulted in all wells in the field being shut-in. While this field is shut-in we do continue to perform routine maintenance to ensure it is in a safe condition. Operating expenses for 2015 and 2014 were $1,406 and $8,926, respectively. At December 31, 2015, we wrote off the remaining book value of this asset by recording $56,648 of impairment expense.\nGeneral and Administrative\nPresented below is a summary of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $87,723 for 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to decreases in investor relations, legal, auditing and professional fees and related party consulting services. Director fees increased by $27,383 and other administrative expenses increased slightly by 1,827. The increase in directors fees is related to shares issued to two board members for five years of service on the board and the addition of a new board member increasing the board from 5 seats to 6 seats.\nWe have an operating agreement with DNR, whereby executive level expertise for our existing and prospective oil and gas properties is provided for a monthly fee of $18,000. This monthly charge is allocated $10,000 to consulting and executive services and $8,000 is allocated to lease operating expense. DNR is an affiliate of Charles B. Davis, an executive officer and director of the Company.\nWe had a net loss for 2015 of $4,747,053 compared to net income of $62,369 for 2014. This decrease was primarily due to decreased revenues from lower oil and natural gas prices and volumes and a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $3.3 million recorded as impairment expense related to our oil and gas properties and gas gathering system. Depreciation, depletion & amortization increased approximately $48,000 due to a lower reserve base. These costs were offset slightly by lower lease operating costs, which decreased approximately $37,000 and lower production taxes, which are directly related to revenue, which decreased approximately $95,000.\nInterest expense decreased from $135,773 for 2014 to $111,910 for 2015. The decrease of $23,863 was due primarily to the pay down of principal on certain notes payable.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn order to execute our drilling plans and to be in a position to seek to acquire additional interests in oil and gas properties that meet our objectives, we need to obtain significant additional financing. Historically, we have used a line of credit, preferred stock offerings and sales of oil and gas properties in order to fund our operations. In late 2015, we raised approximately $1.7 million through a private placement of our Series A2 Preferred Stock to accredited investors only. Also, since 2011, we have sold various interests in some of our oil and gas properties, which have resulted in aggregate net proceeds from three sales of $6,377,000. We intend to continue to sell properties, but only those properties that can be liquidated at attractive prices. There can be no assurance that we will continue to generate any proceeds from the sale of our properties or that we will successfully raise additional capital from sales of our equity.\nWe had a working capital deficit as of December 31, 2015 of approximately $1.4 million, compared to a working capital deficit of approximately $1.3 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in our deficit was primarily due to the payable due to DNR related to a settlement agreement of approximately $300,000 that was accrued as part of operator fees and other in current liabilities, an increase in our current obligation for our asset retirement obligations and certain notes payable that are due within 12 months. This was offset with higher current assets, primarily due to sales of preferred stock.\nWe used $96,890 in operating cash flow during the year ended 2015 compared to $658,919 generated through operating cash flow during the year ended 2014. This is primarily related to lower oil and natural gas prices and lower sales volumes, which resulted in lower revenues of approximately $1.6 million.\nDuring 2015 investing activities used net cash of approximately $1.1 million, which was attributed to an acquisition of oil and gas properties that we closed on December 30, 2015. We also had capital additions of $68,631, which was offset with proceeds received of $50,000 for the sale of one of our wells. During 2014, we generated net proceeds of approximately $313,000 from a participation agreement in an oil and gas property, which was offset with capital additions of $640,000, resulting in net cash used in investing activities of $326,470.\nWe had approximately $1.7 million of net cash provided by financing activities in 2015, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $778,000 in 2014. We borrowed $67,000 against our line of credit during the year, we made principal payments to certain notes payables of $25,568 and we raised $1,665,000 through our Series A2 Preferred Stock private placement. The 2014 financing activities included borrowings of approximately $623,000. These funds were needed to fund our operations, a redemption of Series A1 Preferred Stock of $15,500, repurchase of 1,200,000 shares of common stock for $228,000, and repayment of notes payable of $1,157,000.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no operating leases in place.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn connection with the related party acquisition of oil and gas properties in the third quarter of 2011, we acquired interests in certain geologic zones of the properties. This agreement contained several arrangements that would require us to pay certain amounts depending on certain thresholds met. However, on January 19, 2016, but effective December 31, 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement with the Sellers of these properties, whereby in consideration of the amounts indicated below, the parties (i) terminated Exhibits C and C-2 to the DNR and Tindall PSA for all purposes; (ii) extinguished all liabilities of the Company under Exhibit C of the DNR and Tindall PSA including $250,000, related to the increase in oil prices after the acquisition; (iii) agreed that the promissory note owed by us to DNR in the amount of $792,151 and accrued interest thereon was paid in full; and (iv) released each other against any and all claims which have been raised or could have been raised among them. Specifically, Exhibits C and C-2 to the DNR and Tindall PSA related to potential payments that would have been needed to be made by us in the event oil prices increased to certain levels and related to certain payments that would have been needed to be made by us in the event we sold certain properties purchased under the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Exhibits C and C-2 were terminated and extinguished (including any amounts owed thereunder including $250,000 under Exhibit C to the Purchase and Sale Agreement) in exchange for 25 fully paid, nonassessable restricted shares of our 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock. Consideration to pay the above promissory note in full consisted of us issuing to DNR 65 fully paid, nonassessable restricted shares of our 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock, and paying DNR $303,329 in cash.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period ( ASU 2014-12\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2014-12 require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d ( ASC 718\u201d), as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. The amendments in ASU 2014-12 are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in ASU 2014-12 either: (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.\u201d ASU 2014-08 changes the criteria for reporting a discontinued operation. Under the new pronouncement, a disposal of a part of an organization that has a major effect on its operations and financial results is a discontinued operation. The Company is required to adopt ASU 2014-08 prospectively for all disposals or components of its business classified as held for sale during fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2014. The adoption of ASU 2014-08 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition,\u201d and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition- Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts.\u201d ASU 2014-09's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under today's guidance, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017 and, at that time, the Company may adopt the new standard under the full retrospective approach or the modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the method and impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 will explicitly require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosure in certain circumstances. The new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-15.\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued new authoritative accounting guidance requiring debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the related debt liability. This guidance is to be applied using a retrospective method and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This guidance eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments may be applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company does not expect this to impact its operating results or cash flows.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16 (ASU 2015-16): Business Combinations (Topic 805), effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period, to simplify the accounting for measurement-period adjustments for an acquirer in a business combination. ASU 2015-16 requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The acquirer is required to adjust its financial statements for the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2015-16 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on our financial position and results of operations.\nOther accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB, or other standards-setting bodies, that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements upon adoption.\n\nAR\u00caTE INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nCAUSEY DEMGEN & MOORE P.C.\n1125 Seventeenth Street, Suite 1450\nDenver, Colorado 80202\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nof Ar\u00eate Industries, Inc.\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Ar\u00eate Industries, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ar\u00eate Industries, Inc. at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nAR\u00caTE INDUSTRIES, INC.\nBALANCE SHEETS\nDecember 31,\n\nThe Accompanying Notes are an Integral Part of These Financial Statements.\nAR\u00caTE INDUSTRIES, INC.\nSTATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nYears Ended December 31,\n\nThe Accompanying Notes are an Integral Part of These Financial Statements.\nAR\u00caTE INDUSTRIES, INC.\nSTATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and 2015\n\nThe Accompanying Notes are an Integral Part of These Financial Statements.\nAR\u00caTE INDUSTRIES, INC.\nSTATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n\nThe Accompanying Notes are an Integral Part of These Financial Statements.\nAR\u00caTE INDUSTRIES, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\n 1. Organization and Nature of Operations \nAr\u00eate Industries, Inc. ( Ar\u00eate\u201d or the Company\u201d), is a Colorado corporation that was incorporated on July 21, 1987. The Company is in the business of exploration for and production of oil and natural gas. The Company's primary area of oil exploration and production is in Colorado, Montana, Kansas, and Wyoming.\nThe Company seeks to focus on acquiring interests in traditional exploratory and development oil and gas ventures, and seek properties that offer profit potential from overlooked and by-passed reserves of oil and natural gas, which may include shut-in wells, in-field development, stripper wells, enhanced recovery, re-completion and re-working projects. In addition, the Company's strategy includes the purchase and sale of acreage prospective for oil and natural gas and seeking to obtain cash flow from the sale and farm out of such prospects.\n 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of the Company's financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make various assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Changes in these assumptions, judgments and estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events and, accordingly, actual results could differ from amounts initially established.\nThe most significant areas requiring the use of assumptions, judgments and estimates relate to the volumes of natural gas and oil reserves used in calculating depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d), the amount of expected future cash flows used in determining possible impairments of oil and gas properties and the amount of future capital costs used in these calculations. Assumptions, judgments and estimates also are required in determining future asset retirement obligations, impairments of undeveloped properties, and in valuing stock-based payment awards.\nThe only component of comprehensive income that is applicable to the Company is net income (loss). Accordingly, a separate statement of comprehensive income (loss) is not included in these financial statements.\nCash Equivalents\nFor purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers cash and all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nAccounts Receivable\nThe Company's receivables consist mainly of trade account receivables from working interests in oil and gas production from partners with interests in common properties. Collectability is dependent upon the financial wherewithal of each entity and is influenced by the general economic conditions of the oil and gas industry. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts on a case by case basis once there is evidence that collection is not probable.\nGas Gathering System, Furniture and Equipment\nThe Company's gas gathering system and its furniture and equipment are stated at cost. Material expenditures that increase the life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset. The cost of normal maintenance and repairs is charged to operating expenses as incurred. Upon disposal of an asset, the cost of the asset and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gains or losses will be reflected in current operations. For the gas gathering system, depreciation is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of ten years. Depreciation of furniture and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of five years. At December 31, 2015, the Company wrote this asset off by recording an impairment charge against the gas gathering system of $56,648. Furniture and equipment was fully depreciated at December 31, 2015.\nOil and Gas Producing Activities\nThe Company's oil and gas exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether the well has proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not result in proved reserves, the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the Statements of Cash Flows. The costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive. Oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized.\nOther exploration costs, including certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases, are charged to expense as incurred. The sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit-of-production DD&A rate. A gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of proved properties and is classified in other operating revenues. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense, and renewals and betterments are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts.\nUnevaluated oil and gas property costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties if the properties are subsequently determined to be productive. Proceeds from sales of partial interests in unproved leases are accounted for as a recovery of cost without recognizing any gain until all costs are recovered. Unevaluated oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on a property-by-property basis based on remaining lease terms, drilling results, reservoir performance, commodity price outlooks or future plans to develop acreage.\nThe Company reviews its proved oil and gas properties for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. The Company estimates the expected undiscounted future cash flows of its oil and gas properties and compares such undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to, recent sales prices of comparable properties, the present value of estimated future cash flows, net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of reserves, future commodity pricing, future production estimates, anticipated capital expenditures and various discount rates commensurate with the risk and current market conditions associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected. Once incurred, a write-down may not be reversed in a later period. At December 31, 2015, the Company recorded impairment against its oil and gas properties in the amount of $3,231,000 due to the sustained decline in oil prices in 2015 and forecasts for future prices. There was no impairment at December 31, 2014.\nThe provision for DD&A of oil and gas properties is calculated based on proved reserves on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method. Natural gas is converted to barrel equivalents, BOE, at the rate of six Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of oil. Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, which are net of estimated salvage values, are taken into consideration.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe estimated fair value of the future costs associated with dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of oil and gas properties is recorded generally upon acquisition or completion of a well. The net estimated costs are discounted to present values using a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate over the estimated economic life of the oil and gas properties. Such costs are capitalized as part of the related asset. The asset is depleted on the units-of-production method on a field-by-field basis. The associated liability is classified in current and long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The liability is periodically adjusted to reflect (1) new liabilities incurred, (2) liabilities settled during the period, (3) accretion expense and (4) revisions to estimated future cash flow requirements. The accretion expense is recorded as a component of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 8 - Asset Retirement Obligation.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenues from the sale of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids ( NGL\u201d) when delivery to the purchaser has occurred and title has transferred. The Company uses the sales method to account for gas imbalances. Under this method, revenue is recorded on the basis of gas actually sold by the Company. In addition, the Company will record revenue for its share of gas sold by other owners that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves. The Company also reduces revenue for other owners' gas sold by the Company that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves. The Company's remaining over and under produced gas balancing positions are considered in the Company's proved oil and gas reserves. Gas imbalances at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were not material.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nEnvironmental expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are expensed. Liabilities are accrued when environmental assessments and/or clean-ups are probable, and the costs can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had not accrued for nor been fined or cited for any environmental violations that would have a material adverse effect upon capital expenditures, operating results or the competitive position of the Company.\nIndustry Segment and Geographic Information\nThe Company operates in one industry segment, which is the exploration, development and production of natural gas and crude oil, and all of the Company's operations are conducted in the continental United States. Consequently, the Company currently reports as a single industry segment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company did not grant any stock options or warrants during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and no options or warrants were outstanding at any time during these years. The Company has issued shares of common stock for services performed by officers, directors and unrelated parties during 2015 and 2014. The Company has recorded these transactions based on the value of the services or the value of the common stock, whichever is more readily determinable.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are reported in accordance with GAAP, which requires the establishment of deferred tax accounts for all temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using currently enacted federal and state income tax rates. In addition, deferred tax accounts must be adjusted to reflect new rates if enacted.\nRealization of deferred tax assets is contingent on the generation of future taxable income. As a result, management considers whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will be realized during periods when they are available, and if not, management provides a valuation allowance for amounts not likely to be recognized.\nManagement periodically evaluates tax reporting methods to determine if any uncertain tax positions exist that would require the establishment of a loss contingency. A loss contingency would be recognized if it were probable that a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nCash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and notes payable are carried in the Consolidated Financial Statements in amounts which approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and revenue receivables. The Company periodically maintains cash balances at a commercial bank in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit of $250,000. At December 31, 2015, the Company's uninsured cash balance was $271,666. The Company received 82% and 84% of its oil and gas production revenue from two purchasers during fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe concentration of credit risk in the oil and gas industry affects the overall exposure to credit risk because customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic net income (loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and other dilutive securities. The only potentially dilutive securities for the diluted earnings per share calculations consist of Series A2 preferred stock that is convertible into common stock at an exchange price of $2.00 per common share. As of December 31, 2015, the convertible preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation preference of $2,670,000 and was convertible to 1,335,000 shares of common stock. These shares were excluded from the earnings per share calculation because they would be anti-dilutive. All of the Series A1 preferred stock was redeemed during the year ended December 31, 2014, therefore, there was no outstanding preferred stock at December 31, 2014.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\n\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period ( ASU 2014-12\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2014-12 require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic No. 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d ( ASC 718\u201d), as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. The amendments in ASU 2014-12 are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in ASU 2014-12 either: (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. The adoption of ASU 2014-12 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.\u201d ASU 2014-08 changes the criteria for reporting a discontinued operation. Under the new pronouncement, a disposal of a part of an organization that has a major effect on its operations and financial results is a discontinued operation. The Company is required to adopt ASU 2014-08 prospectively for all disposals or components of its business classified as held for sale during fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2014. The adoption of ASU 2014-08 did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d ( ASU 2014-09\u201d), which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition,\u201d and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition- Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts.\u201d ASU 2014-09's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under today's guidance, including identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017 and, at that time, the Company may adopt the new standard under the full retrospective approach or the modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the method and impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15\u201d). ASU 2014-15 will explicitly require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosure in certain circumstances. The new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual period ending after December 15, 2016. Earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-15.\nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued new authoritative accounting guidance requiring debt issuance costs to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the related debt liability. This guidance is to be applied using a retrospective method and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of this guidance and assessing its impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. This guidance eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments may be applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company does not expect this to impact its operating results or cash flows.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16 (ASU 2015-16): Business Combinations (Topic 805), effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within that reporting period, to simplify the accounting for measurement-period adjustments for an acquirer in a business combination. ASU 2015-16 requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The acquirer is required to adjust its financial statements for the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2015-16 and assessing the impact, if any, it may have on our financial position and results of operations.\n 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Oil and Gas Properties \nAcquisitions\nIn 2011, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement ( DNR and Tindall PSA\u201d) and other related agreements and documents with Tucker Family Investments, LLLP, which we refer to as Tucker\u201d; DNR Oil & Gas, Inc. which we refer to as DNR\u201d; and Tindall Operating Company, which we refer to as Tindall\u201d, and collectively we refer to these parties as the Sellers\u201d, for the purchase of certain oil and gas operating properties in Colorado, Kansas, Wyoming, and Montana. DNR is owned primarily by an officer and director of the Company, Charles B. Davis, and he is an affiliate of Tucker and Tindall. The consideration for the purchase was determined by bargaining between management of the Company and Mr. Davis, and the Company used reports of independent engineering firms to analyze the purchase price. The base purchase price was paid in full on September 29, 2011.\nOn January 19, 2016, but effective December 31, 2015, (the \"Effective Date\") we entered into a Settlement Agreement with Tucker, DNR and Tindall regarding the DNR and Tindall PSA and other related matters. In consideration of the amounts indicated below, the parties (i) terminated Exhibits C and C-2 to the DNR and Tindall PSA for all purposes; (ii) extinguished all liabilities of the Company under Exhibit C of the DNR and Tindall PSA including $250,000 related to the increase in oil prices after the acquisition; (iii) agreed that the promissory note of $792,151 due to DNR (See Note 5 - Notes and Advances Payable) and accrued interest thereon was paid in full; and (iv) released each other against any and all claims which have been raised or could have been raised among them. Specifically, Exhibits C and C-2 to the DNR and Tindall PSA related to potential payments that would have needed to have been made by the us in the event oil prices increased to certain levels and related to certain payments to have been made by us in the event we sold certain properties purchased under the DNR and Tindall PSA. Exhibits C and C-2 were terminated and extinguished (including any amounts owed thereunder including $250,000 under Exhibit C to the DNR and Tindall PSA) in exchange for 25 fully paid nonassessable restricted shares of our 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock. Consideration to pay the above promissory note in full consisted of the issuance to DNR of 65 fully paid, nonassessable restricted shares of its 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock, and paying DNR $303,329 in cash. A description of the terms of the 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock, including its terms of conversion into shares of the Company's common stock is set forth in Note 4 below. The Company recorded an expense of $141,099 included in other operating expense in the statement of operations as a result of this transaction.\nOn December 30, 2015, the Company completed an asset acquisition pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement executed on November 25, 2015, but effective December 1, 2015 (the \"Wellstar Purchase and Sale Agreement \") with Wellstar Corporation (the \"Seller\"), an unaffiliated corporation. The assets acquired were producing oil and gas leases in Sumner County, Kansas and Kimball County, Nebraska (collectively, the \"Properties\" and individually, the \"Padgett Properties\" and the \"Nebraska Properties\"). The Company acquired 51% of Seller's interest (ranging from 47% to 100% of the working interests) in the Padgett Properties and acquired 100% of the Seller's interest (100% of the working interests) in the Nebraska Properties for aggregate consideration of $1,100,000 and the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of the Company's restricted common stock valued at $0.10 per share at the date of closing, or $100,000.\nThe table below presents the purchase price allocation for the Wellstar Purchase and Sale Agreement:\n\nPro-Forma information acquisition (unaudited)\nThe table below reflects unaudited pro forma results as if the acquisition of oil and gas properties had taken place as of January 1, 2014:\n\nThe unaudited pro forma data gives effect to the actual operating results of the acquired properties prior to the acquisition, adjusted to include the pro forma effect of depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion based on the purchase price of the properties.\n 4. Oil and Gas Properties \nThe following table sets forth information concerning the Company's oil and gas properties:\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded depletion expense of $746,104 and $701,042, respectively. The Company recorded impairment expense of $3,037,000 and $194,000 against proved and unevaluated oil and gas properties, respectively at December 31, 2015. There was no impairment expense during fiscal year ended December 31, 2014.\n 5. Fair Value Measurements \nFASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d, establishes a framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under FASB ASC 820 are described as follows:\n - Level 1 - Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets, for substantially identical assets and liabilities. \n - Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 for similar assets and liabilities. These include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. If the asset or liability has a specified or contractual term, the input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \n - Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, generally requiring a significant amount of judgment by management. The assets or liabilities fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques used need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. \nThe methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Further, although the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nUpon completion of wells, the Company records an asset retirement obligation at fair value using Level 3 assumptions.\nNonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis upon impairment. The following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Company's assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015:\n\n(1) The gas gathering system was written off entirely at December 31, 2015.\nThe fair values of the properties were determined using discounted cash flow models. The discounted cash flows were based on management's expectations for the future. The inputs included estimates of future crude oil and natural gas production, commodity prices based on sales contracted terms or commodity price curves as of the date of the estimate, estimated operating and development costs, as a risk-adjusted discount rate of 10%.\nThe carrying amounts of other financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, account payables, accrued liabilities and long term debt in our balance sheet approximates fair value as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nStockholders' Equity\nCommon Stock\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company purchased an option to acquire rights in minerals owned by William W. Stewart (related party) for 150,000 shares of common stock valued at $34,500.\nOn January 30, 2014, the Company entered into a Direct Stock Purchase Agreement with Burlingame Equity Investors II L.P. and Burlingame Equity Investors Master Fund, L.P., whereby the Company purchased an aggregate 1,200,000 shares of its common stock from these entities at a price of $0.19 per share for total consideration of $228,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued 736,954 shares of common stock as compensation for services; 480,288 shares of common stock were issued for board services ranging in value from $0.10 to $0.20 per share and 256,666 shares of common stock were issued for consulting services provided by three related parties ranging in value from $0.10 to $0.16 per share.\nThe Company issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock valued at $0.10 per share or $100,000 related to the Wellstar Purchase and Sale Agreement that was executed on December 30, 2015. See Note 3 - Acquisitions, for additional information regarding this transaction.\nPreferred Stock\nOn September 29, 2011, the Company completed a private placement of its Series A1 Preferred Stock which resulted in the issuance of 522.5 shares for gross proceeds of $5,225,000.\nEffective June 28, 2013, several holders of the Company's Series A1 Convertible Preferred Stock elected to convert shares of such stock into the Company's common stock at a redemption price of $0.75 per common share. In connection with those redemptions all such holders agreed to waive all dividend rights on their shares of Series A1 Preferred Stock subsequent to March 30, 2013. Information regarding the conversions is set forth below.\n\nIn connection with the conversions of Series A1 Preferred Stock by Burlingame Equity Investors II, LP and Burlingame Equity Investors Master Fund, LP, the Company entered into transactions with these entities in exchange for cash consideration, promissory notes and cancellation of certain Series A1 Preferred Shares.\n\nOn August 15, 2014, the Company redeemed the remaining 10 shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock for consideration of $77,500, of which $15,500 was paid in cash and the remaining amount as a promissory note for $62,000. See additional discussion of the note below in Note 5 - Notes and Advances Payable.\nOn December 11, 2015, the Company began a private placement of its Series A2 7% Preferred Convertible Stock with a maximum amount of 600 shares at $10,000 per share or $6,000,000. At December 31, 2015, the Company had sold subscriptions equal to $1,750,000 (175 shares) and issued to DNR 90 shares fully paid ($900,000), nonassessable restricted shares of its 7% Series A2 Convertible Preferred Stock as part of the consideration for a settlement agreement entered into with DNR (See Note 5 - Advances and Notes Payable for details of the settlement).\nThe following are the terms of the Preferred Stock Series A2:\nAuthorized Shares, Stated Value and Liquidation Preference. Six hundred shares are designated as the Series A2 7% Convertible Preferred Stock, which has a stated value and liquidation preference of $10,000 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends.\nRanking. The Series A2 Preferred Stock will rank senior to future classes or series of preferred stock established after the issue date of the Series A2 Preferred Stock, unless the Company's Board of Directors expressly provides otherwise when establishing a future class or series. The Series A2 Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company's common stock but it is junior to the Company's outstanding debt and accounts payable.\nDividends. Holders of Series A2 Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends at an annual rate of 7.0% of the $10,000 per share liquidation preference, payable quarterly on each of March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31. Dividends are payable in cash or in shares of common stock (at its then fair market value), at the Company's election.\nVoting Rights. Holders of the Series A2 Preferred Stock will vote together with the holders of the Company's common stock as a single class on all matters upon which the holders of common stock are entitled to vote. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to such number of votes as the number of shares of common stock into which such share of Preferred Stock is convertible; however, solely for the purpose of determining such number of votes, the conversion price per share will be deemed to be $2.00, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustment. In addition, the holders of the Series A2 Preferred Stock will vote as a separate class with respect to certain matters, including amendments to the Company's Articles of Incorporation that alter the voting powers, preferences and special rights of the Series A2 Preferred Stock.\nLiquidation. In the event we voluntarily or involuntarily liquidate, dissolve or wind up, the holders of the Series A2 Preferred Stock will be entitled, before any distribution or payment out of the Company's assets may be made to or set aside for the holders of any of the Company's junior capital stock and subject to the rights of the Company's creditors, to receive a liquidation distribution in an amount equal to $10,000 per share, plus any unpaid dividends. A merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's property or business is not deemed to be a liquidation for purposes of the preceding sentence.\nRedemption by the Company. The Series A2 Preferred Stock is redeemable in whole or in part at the Company's option at any time for cash. The redemption price is equal to $10,000 per share, plus any unpaid dividends.\nOptional Redemption by Holder. Unless prohibited by Colorado law governing distributions to shareholders, the Company, upon 90 days' prior written request from any holders of outstanding shares of Series A2 Preferred Stock, in its sole discretion, may redeem at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) $10,000 per share and (ii) the accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, to the redemption date, up to one-third of each holder's outstanding shares of Series A2 Preferred Stock on: (i) the first anniversary of the Original Issue Date (the \"First Redemption Date\"), (ii) the second anniversary of the Original Issue Date (the \"Second Redemption Date\") and (iii) the third anniversary of the Original Issue Date (the \"Third Redemption Date\", along with the First Redemption Date and the Second Redemption Date, collectively, each a \"Redemption Date\"). If on any Redemption Date, Colorado law governing distributions to shareholders prevents the Company from redeeming all shares of Series A2 Preferred Stock to be redeemed, the Company may ratably redeem the maximum number of shares that it may redeem consistent with such law, and may also redeem the remaining shares as soon as it may lawfully do so under such law.\nPreemptive Rights. Holders of the Series A2 Preferred Stock do not have preemptive rights.\nMandatory Conversion. Each share of Series A2 Preferred Stock remaining outstanding will automatically be converted into shares of the Company's common stock upon the earlier of (i) any closing of underwritten public offering by us of shares of common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, in which the aggregate cash proceeds to be received by us and selling stockholders (if any) from such offering (without deducting underwriting discounts, expenses and commissions) are at least $7,000,000, and per share sales price is at least $3.00 (such price to be adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations or splits or (ii) the date agreed to by written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Series A2 Preferred Stock.\nOptional Conversion by Investors. At any time, each holder of Series A2 Preferred Stock has the right, at the holder's option, to convert all or any portion of such holder's Series A2 Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $2.00 per share prior to the mandatory conversion of the Series A2 Preferred Stock.\n 7. Notes and advances payable \nNotes payable consist of the following as of December 31:\n\n (1) On April 29, 2013, the Company executed a promissory note under which the Company agreed to pay Apex Financial Services Corp, a Colorado corporation, ( Apex\u201d) the principal sum of $1,000,000, with interest accruing at an annual rate of 7.5%, with principal and interest due on May 31, 2014, and subsequently extended to March 31, 2017. The Company also agreed to assign 75% of its operating income from its oil and gas operations and any lease or well sale or any other assets sales to Apex to secure the debt. Apex is 100% owned by the CEO, director, and shareholder of the Company, Nicholas L. Scheidt. The Company borrowed the full amount of principal on the note, and also paid a loan fee of $10,000. In the event of default on the note and failure to cure the default in ten days, Apex may accelerate payment and the annual interest rate on the note will accrue at 18%. Default includes failure to pay the note when due or if the Company borrows any other monies or offers security in the Company or in the collateral securing the note prior to the note being paid in full. The outstanding principal balance as of December 31, 2015, was $120,728. \n (2) On January 28, 2014, we entered into a line of credit loan agreement for $1,500,000 due January 15, 2015 extended to January 28, 2016, and further extended after December 31, 2015 to May 28, 2016. The terms of the note are as follows: 1) the accrued interest is payable monthly starting February 28, 2014, 2) the interest rate is variable based on an index calculated based on a prime rate as published by the Wall Street Journal index (currently 3.5%) plus an add on index with the current and minimum rate of 6.5%, the note has draw provisions and is secured by seven wells and leases owned by the Company, a certificate of deposit for $500,000 at CityWide Banks pledged by a related party, and 5) the personal guarantee of Nicholas Scheidt, Chief Executive Officer. The amount eligible for borrowing on the Credit Facility is limited to the lesser of (i) 65% of the Company's PV10 value of its carbon reserves based upon the most current engineering reserve report or (ii) 48 month cumulative cash flow based upon the most current engineering reserve report. In addition to the borrowing base limitation, the Company is required to maintain and meet certain affirmative and negative covenants and conditions in order to draw advances on the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains certain representations, warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Company, which are customarily applicable to senior secured loan facilities. Key covenants include limitations on indebtedness, restricted payments, creation of liens on oil and gas properties, hedging transactions, mergers and consolidations, sales of assets, use of loan proceeds, change in business, and change in control. The above-referenced promissory note contains customary default and acceleration provisions and provides for a default interest rate of 21% per annum. In addition, the Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including: (a) failure to pay any obligations when due; (b) failure to comply with certain restrictive covenants; (c) false or misleading representations or warranties; (d) defaults of other indebtedness; (e) specified events of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings; (f) one or more final, non-appealable judgments in excess of $50,000 that is not covered by insurance; (g) change in control (25% threshold); (h) negative events affecting the Guarantor; and (i) lender in good faith believes itself insecure. In an event of default arising from the specified events, the Credit Facility provides that the commitments thereunder will terminate and the Lender may take such other actions as permitted including, declaring any principal and accrued interest owed on the line of credit to become immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility is secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company, pursuant to a Security Agreement, Deed of Trust and Assignment of As-Extracted Collateral entered into between the Company and Citywide Banks. The outstanding principal balance as of December 31, 2015 was $616,105. \n (3) On January 1, 2014, we memorialized certain short-term liabilities into formal promissory notes. Information concerning these promissory notes is set forth in the table below. \n\nThe above-referenced promissory notes contain customary default and acceleration provisions and provide for a default interest rate of 18% per annum. The aggregate outstanding principal balance on the notes as of December 31, 2015 was $63,464.\n (4) We issued an unsecured promissory note in the amount of $792,151 on January 1, 2014 to DNR. The note accrues interest at the rate of 2.50% for the calendar years 2014 and 2015, 4.00% for the calendar year 2016, 6.00% for the calendar year 2017 and 8.00% for the remainder of the term of the DNR note. The DNR note matures on January 1, 2019. \nOn January 19, 2016, but effective December 31, 2015, (the \"Effective Date\") we entered into a Settlement Agreement with DNR and Tindall Operating Company discussed above under which the DNR Note was deemed paid in full.\n (5) In June 2013, in connection with the conversions of Series A1 Preferred Stock by Burlingame Equity Investors II, LP and Burlingame Equity Investors Master Fund, LP, the Company issued unsecured promissory notes in the original principal amounts of $48,000 and $552,000, respectively, with interest at 7% per annum payable quarterly and all unpaid interest and principal due on July 23, 2014. We have agreed with the holders of these two existing notes to extend the maturity date of the notes to May 25, 2016. Information concerning the principal pay down is set forth in the following table. \n\n (6) On March 28, 2012, the Company executed a Promissory Note with Fairfield Management Group, LLC ( Fairfield\u201d), a related party. The note accrues interest at 7.5%, payable monthly and has a maturity date of March 31, 2016. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, Fairfield assigned this note to Donald Prosser (former CFO and Director). Subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company and Mr. Prosser extended the due date to March 31, 2017. \n (7) On March 28, 2012, the Company executed a promissory note with Pikerni, LLC ( Pikerni\u201d). This note was extended and amended on April 1, 2015. The note accrues interest at 7.5% and is payable quarterly. The maturity date of the note is April 1, 2016, with principal payments of $5,000 due on June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015, December 31, 2015, and March 31, 2016, and the remaining principal balance of $80,000 due on April 1, 2016. At December 31, 2015, the Company was in default on this note. The Company is currently negotiating an amendment with Pikerni to cure the default. \n (8) On August 15, 2014, the Company redeemed the remaining 10 shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding for consideration of $77,500, of which $15,500 was paid in cash and the remaining amount as a promissory note for $62,000. The note accrues interest at 7% per annum, payable in two installments as follows; \n a. A payment of $31,000, plus accrued and unpaid interest was payable on August 15, 2015 \n b. A payment of $31,000, plus accrued and unpaid interest shall be payable on August 15, 2016 \nThe Company did not make the August 15, 2015, principal payment and is currently in default on this note. The Company is negotiating new terms with the note holder.\n 8. General and Administrative Expenses \nIn connection with the property acquisition agreement entered into in the third quarter of 2011, the Company executed an operating agreement whereby DNR provides services to operate all of the properties acquired by the Company for a monthly fee of $23,000. The operating agreement expired on March 31, 2012 and renews on a month to month basis.\nBased on operator costs for the properties prior to the Company's acquisition, approximately $8,000 per month was classified as lease operating expenses and $15,000 per month was classified as related party consulting fees. Effective July 1, 2012, the monthly operator fee was reduced to $18,000 per month, of which $8,000 per month is included in lease operating expense and the remaining $10,000 per month is included in related party consulting fees in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPresented below is a summary of general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\n 9. Income Taxes \nAt December 31, 2015, the Company has net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes of approximately $8,336,000. If not previously utilized, the NOL carryforwards will expire in 2018 through 2035.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company did not recognize any current or deferred income tax benefit or expense. Actual income tax benefit (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 differs from the amounts computed using the federal statutory tax rate of 34%, as follows:\n\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below:\n\nA valuation allowance has been recorded for all deferred tax assets since the more likely than not\u201d realization criterion was not met as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nA tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized if it is more likely than not\u201d that the position is sustainable based solely on its technical merits. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits and management is not aware of any issues that would cause a significant increase to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next year. The Company's policy is to recognize any interest or penalties as a component of income tax expense. The Company's material taxing jurisdictions are comprised of the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the states of Colorado, Wyoming and Kansas. The tax years 2010 through 2015 remain open to examination by these taxing jurisdictions.\n 10. Asset Retirement Obligations \nThe Company follows accounting for asset retirement obligations ( ARO\u201d) in accordance with ASC 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it was incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The Company's ARO primarily represents the estimated present value of the amounts expected to be incurred to plug, abandon and remediate producing and shut-in wells at the end of their productive lives in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. The Company determines the estimated fair value of its ARO by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to plugging and abandonment liabilities. The significant inputs used to calculate such liabilities include estimates of costs to be incurred; the Company's credit adjusted discount rates, inflation rates and estimated dates of abandonment. The ARO is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized asset retirement costs are amortized using the unit of production method.\nA reconciliation of the Company's ARO for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 is as follows:\n\n 11. Commitments and Contingencies \nLease commitments. The Company entered into a lease for property access rights and compressor space in Wyoming related to the Company's natural gas gathering system. The expense in 2015 and 2014 was approximately $1,400 and $9,000, which is included in gas gathering operating costs. The Company used office space and conference room space provided by a director for an annual charge of $3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company does not have any operating leases in place at December 31, 2015.\nLegal Proceedings. The Company is subject to the risk of litigation, claims and assessments that may arise in the ordinary course of its business activities, including contractual matters and regulatory proceedings. As of December 31, 2015, the Company was not subject to any pending litigation and management is not currently aware of any asserted or unasserted claims and assessments that may impact the Company's future results of operations.\n 12. Subsequent Events \nThe following are the subsequent events:\nThe Company extended the following notes subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2015;\n \u00b7 Donald W. Prosser (formerly Fairfield) - $100,000 principal - extended to March 31, 2017 \n \u00b7 Apex Financial Services Corp.- $120,728 principal- extended to March 31, 2017 \n \u00b7 CityWide Banks - $616, 105 principal- extended to May 28, 2016 \n \u00b7 Burlingame Equity Investors II, LP - extended to May 25, 2016 \n \u00b7 Burlingame Equity Investors Master Fund, LP - extended to May 25, 2016 \n(See Note 7.)\n 13. Supplementary Oil and Gas Information (unaudited) \nCosts Incurred in Oil and Gas Producing Activities\nCosts incurred in oil and gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities and related depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion ( DD&A\u201d) per equivalent unit-of-production were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nSupplemental Oil and Gas Reserve Information\nThe reserve information presented below is based on estimates of net proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 that were prepared by Pinnacle Energy Services, L.L.C. and Ryder Scott Company, respectively, the Company's independent petroleum engineering firms, in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC.\nProved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions (i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made). Proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.\nChanges in Proved Reserves\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the Company's estimated total proved and oil and gas reserve quantities for the years ended December 31:\n\nStandardized Measure\nCertain information concerning the assumptions used in computing the valuation of proved reserves and their inherent limitations are discussed below. The Company believes such information is essential for a proper understanding and assessment of the data presented.\nAs of December 31, 2014, future cash inflows were computed by applying the SEC-mandated 12 month arithmetic average of the first of month price for January through December of 2014, which resulted in benchmark prices of $94.99 per barrel for crude oil and $4.35 per MMbtu for natural gas. Prices were further adjusted for transportation, quality and basis differentials, which resulted in an average price used as of December 31, 2014, of $84.09 per barrel of oil and $6.09 per Mcf for natural gas.\nAs of December 31, 2015, future cash inflows were computed by applying the SEC-mandated 12 month arithmetic average of the first of month price for January through December of 2015, which resulted in benchmark prices of $50.28 per barrel for crude oil and $2.587 per MMbtu for natural gas. Prices were further adjusted for transportation, quality and basis differentials, which resulted in a difference from the benchmark prices ranging from -$3.40 per barrel to -$10.77 per barrel, depending on the location of the wells. The calculated natural gas differentials ranged from -81% to +59% as a percentage of the benchmark prices depending on where the well was located.\nThe assumptions used to compute estimated future cash inflows do not necessarily reflect the Company's expectations of actual revenues or costs, nor their present worth. In addition, variations from the expected production rate also could result directly or indirectly from factors outside of the Company's control, such as unexpected delays in development, changes in prices or regulatory or environmental policies. The reserve valuation further assumes that all reserves will be disposed of by production. However, if reserves are sold in place, additional economic considerations could also affect the amount of cash eventually realized.\nFuture development and production costs are computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year, based on year-end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions.\nFuture income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax rates, with consideration of future tax rates already legislated, to the future pre-tax net cash flows relating to the Company's proved oil and gas reserves. Net operating losses incurred in oil and gas producing activities are utilized to reduce taxable income. Permanent differences in oil and gas related tax credits and allowances are recognized, if reasonably estimable.\nA 10% annual discount rate was used to reflect the timing of the future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves. The following table presents the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2013 and 2014:\n\nThe present value (at a 10% annual discount) of future net cash flows from the Company's proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of its estimated oil and gas reserves. The Company bases the estimated discounted future net cash flows from its proved reserves on average prices realized in the preceding year and on costs in effect at the end of the year. However, actual future net cash flows from the Company's oil and gas properties will also be affected by factors such as actual prices the Company receives for oil and gas, the amount and timing of actual production, supply of and demand for oil and gas and changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both the Company's production and incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% annual discount factor the Company uses when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the Company or the oil and gas industry in general.\nA summary of changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is as follows for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014:\n\n Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE \nNot Applicable.\n\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2015, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the Certifying Officers\u201d) conducted evaluations of our disclosure controls and procedures. As defined under Sections 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, the term disclosure controls and procedures\u201d means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including the Certifying Officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Certifying Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that material information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported by our management on a timely basis in order to comply with the disclosure requirements under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act, as amended.

All services performed by Causey Demgen and Moore, P.C. in 2015 and 2014 were pre-approved by our Audit Committee. Having considered whether the provision of the auditors' services other than for the annual audit and quarterly reviews is compatible with its independence, the Audit Committee has concluded that it is.\nThe Audit Committee on an annual basis reviews audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditors. All audit and non-audit services are pre-approved by the Audit Committee, which considers, among other things, the possible effect of the performance of such services on the auditors' independence. All requests for services to be provided by the independent auditor, which must include a description of the services to be rendered and the amount of corresponding fees, are submitted to the Chief Executive or Financial Officer.

Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) presents critical accounting policies, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, contractual obligations and commercial commitments, off-balance sheet arrangements, new accounting pronouncements, controls, and procedures.\n\n2. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a significant working capital deficit and relied on loans, primarily from related parties, to fund operations.\n\n3. The Company completed the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in four states during the third quarter of 2011, and faces challenges obtaining additional financing to exploit drilling opportunities or acquire further properties.\n\n4. Revenues from operations are linked heavily to crude oil prices, and the Company has a line of credit totaling $1.5 million.\n\n5. The Company aims to maintain low operating expenses and requires additional capital to address its working capital deficit.\n\n6. Critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, use of estimates, oil, and gas producing activities, and asset retirement obligations.\n\n7. Net loss for 2015 was substantially higher due to decreased revenues from lower oil and natural gas prices and a non-cash charge for impairment expenses related to oil and gas properties.\n\n8. The Company raised approximately $1.7 million through a private placement of its Series A2 Preferred Stock.\n\n9. No operating leases were in place as of December 31, 2015.\n\n10. New accounting pronouncements could affect the Company's financial statements and disclosures in the future.\n\n11. Significant subsequent events up to the filing date are noted, including the extension of various promissory notes and the need for additional financing through stock private placement.\n\n12. The financial statements section includes the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and statements of operations, stockholders' equity, cash flows, and related notes to financial statements."}
