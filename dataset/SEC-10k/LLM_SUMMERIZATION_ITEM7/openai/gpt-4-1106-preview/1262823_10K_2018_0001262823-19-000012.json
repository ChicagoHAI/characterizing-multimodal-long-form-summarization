Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe are a vertically integrated global manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals, polymers and building products. Our two principal operating segments are Olefins and Vinyls. We use the majority of our internally-produced basic chemicals to produce higher value-added chemicals and building products.\nConsumption of the basic chemicals that we manufacture in the commodity portions of our olefins and vinyls processes has increased significantly since we began operations in 1986. Our olefins and vinyls products are some of the most widely used chemicals in the world and are upgraded into a wide variety of higher value-added chemical products used in many end-markets. Petrochemicals are typically manufactured in large volume by a number of different producers using widely available technologies. The petrochemical industry exhibits cyclical commodity characteristics, and margins are influenced by changes in the balance between supply and demand and the resulting operating rates, the level of general economic activity and the price of raw materials. The cycle is generally characterized by periods of tight supply, leading to high operating rates and margins, followed by a decline in operating rates and margins primarily as a result of excess new capacity additions. Due to the significant size of new plants, capacity additions are built in large increments and typically require several years of demand growth to be absorbed.\nEthane-based ethylene producers have in the recent past experienced a cost advantage over naphtha-based ethylene producers during periods of higher crude oil prices. This cost advantage has resulted in a strong export market for polyethylene and other ethylene derivatives and has benefited operating margins and cash flows for our Olefins segment during such periods. However, we have seen a significant reduction in the cost advantage enjoyed by North American ethane-based ethylene producers due to lower crude oil prices from the third quarter of 2014 through 2018, which has resulted in reduced prices and lower margins for our Olefins segment. Further, our Olefins segment has experienced lower profitability in recent periods due to new ethylene and polyethylene capacity additions in North America and Asia that have led to higher global demand for ethane, resulting in higher feedstock costs as well as additional supply of ethylene and polyethylene. Looking forward, new ethylene and polyethylene capacity additions in North America, Asia and the Middle East will add additional supply and may continue to contribute to periods of lower profitability. However, increasing demand driven by strong economic growth may be able to absorb some of such additional supply.\nSince late 2010, the PVC industry in the U.S. has experienced an increase in PVC resin exports, driven largely by more competitive feedstock and energy cost positions in the U.S. As a consequence, the U.S. PVC resin industry operating rates have improved since 2010. In addition, our 2014 acquisition of Vinnolit Holdings GmbH and its subsidiary companies, an integrated global leader in specialty PVC resins, has contributed to improved operating margins and cash flows for our Vinyls segment. With the acquisition of Axiall Corporation (\"Axiall\") in 2016, Westlake is the third-largest chlor-alkali producer and the third-largest PVC producer in the world. Globally, there were large chlor-alkali capacity additions between 2008 and 2015 resulting in excess capacity and lower industry operating rates which exerted downward pressure on caustic soda pricing. Since 2015, the capacity additions have been outpaced by an increase in demand driven by improving economic growth and U.S. producers' competitive export position, which has resulted in improved operating rates and caustic soda pricing. Westlake is the second-largest purchaser of ethylene in the U.S., and lower prices of ethylene could positively impact our Vinyls segment. Our recent acquisition of NAKAN is expected to expand our Vinyls segment's downstream business and increase our global footprint.\nWe purchase significant amounts of ethane feedstock, natural gas, ethylene and salt from external suppliers for use in production of basic chemicals in the olefins and vinyls chains. We also purchase significant amounts of electricity to supply the energy required in our production processes. While we have agreements providing for the supply of ethane feedstock, natural gas, ethylene, salt and electricity, the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile. Factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past, and which may do so in the future include:\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the availability of feedstock from shale gas and oil drilling;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>supply and demand for crude oil;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>ethane and liquefied natural gas exports;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>capacity constraints due to higher construction costs for investments, construction delays, strike action or involuntary shutdowns;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the general level of business and economic activity; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant volatility in raw material costs tends to put pressure on product margins as sales price increases could lag behind raw material cost increases. Conversely, when raw material costs decrease, customers may seek immediate relief in the form of lower sales prices. We currently use derivative instruments to reduce price volatility risk on feedstock commodities and lower overall costs. Normally, there is a pricing relationship between a commodity that we process and the feedstock from which it is derived. When this pricing relationship deviates from historical norms, we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments and physical positions in an attempt to take advantage of this relationship.\nOur historical results have been significantly affected by our plant production capacity, our efficient use of that capacity and our ability to increase capacity. Since our inception, we have followed a disciplined growth strategy that focuses on plant acquisitions, new plant construction and internal expansion. We evaluate each expansion project on the basis of its ability to produce sustained returns in excess of our cost of capital and its ability to improve efficiency or reduce operating costs. We also regularly look at acquisition opportunities that would be consistent with, or complimentary to, our overall business strategies. Depending on the size of the acquisition, any such acquisitions could require external financing.\nAs noted above in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" we are subject to extensive environmental regulations, which may impose significant additional costs on our operations in the future. Further, concerns about GHG emissions and their possible effects on climate change has led to the enactment of regulations, and to proposed legislation and additional regulations, that could affect us in the form of increased cost of feedstocks and fuel, other increased costs of production and decreased demand for our products. While we do not expect any of these enactments or proposals to have a material adverse effect on us in the near term, we cannot predict the longer-term effect of any of these regulations or proposals on our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe body of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States is commonly referred to as \"GAAP.\" For this purpose, a non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined by the SEC as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable GAAP measures. In this report, we disclose non-GAAP financial measures, primarily earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"). EBITDA is calculated as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The non-GAAP financial measures described in this Form 10-K are not substitutes for the GAAP measures of earnings and cash flows.\nEBITDA is included in this Form 10-K because our management considers it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, some of which present EBITDA when reporting their results. We regularly evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and/or tax rates by using EBITDA. In addition, we utilize EBITDA in evaluating acquisition targets. Management also believes that EBITDA is a useful tool for measuring our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements, and EBITDA is commonly used by us and our investors to measure our ability to service indebtedness. EBITDA is not a substitute for the GAAP measures of earnings or of cash flows and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. In addition, it should be noted that companies calculate EBITDA differently and, therefore, EBITDA as presented for us may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies. EBITDA has material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and income taxes.\nRecent Developments\nOn January 2, 2019, we completed the acquisition of NAKAN, a global compounding solutions business, for approximately $250 million. NAKAN's products are used in a wide-variety of applications, including in the automotive, building and construction, and medical industries.\nOn October 4, 2018, Westlake Chemical Partners LP (\"Westlake Partners\") and Westlake Chemical Partners GP LLC, the general partner of Westlake Partners, entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the \"ATM Agreement\") with UBS Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (collectively, the \"Managers\"). Pursuant to the terms of the ATM Agreement, Westlake Partners may offer and sell common units representing limited partner interests in Westlake Partners from time to time to, or through, the Managers, as Westlake Partners' sales agents or as principals, having an aggregate offering amount of up to $50 million. Westlake Partners intends to use the net proceeds of sales of the common units for general partnership purposes, including the funding of potential future drop-downs and other acquisitions.\nOn August 17, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase an additional $150 million of shares of our common stock under our 2014 share repurchase program. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Liquidity and Financing Arrangements\" below for further discussions.\nWe have an 81.7% limited partner interest in Westlake Chemical OpCo LP (\"OpCo\"), a 43.8% limited partner interest in Westlake Partners, a general partner interest in Westlake Partners and incentive distribution rights (\"IDRs\"). On July 27, 2018, the Westlake Partners' partnership agreement was amended to revise the minimum quarterly distribution thresholds for Westlake Partners' IDRs. For more information on the amendment, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOn July 24, 2018, we entered into a new $1 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to mature on July 24, 2023. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt-Credit Agreement\" for more information.\nOn May 15, 2018, we redeemed all of the outstanding Westlake 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023 ($434 million aggregate principal amount) and all of the outstanding Axiall Corporation 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023 ($16 million aggregate principal amount) (collectively, the \"2023 Notes\") at a redemption price equal to 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2023 Notes to the redemption date.\nOn February 15, 2018, we redeemed all of the outstanding Westlake 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 ($625 million aggregate principal amount) and all of the outstanding Eagle Spinco Inc. 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 ($63 million aggregate principal amount) (collectively, the \"2021 Notes\") at a redemption price equal to 102.313% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2021 Notes to the redemption date.\nResults of

This represents a decrease in net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation of $308 million, or $2.38 per diluted share, compared to 2017 net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation of $1,304 million, or $10.00 per diluted share, on net sales of $8,041 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased versus the prior year primarily due to the recognition of a $591 million income tax benefit in 2017 under U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") and higher ethane feedstock costs. These decreases were partially offset by (1) higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda; (2) a lower effective income tax rate resulting from the reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act; (3) lower purchased ethylene costs; (4) higher other income, including a one-time pension settlement gain of $14 million, and higher interest income; and (5) a lower interest expense due to lower average debt outstanding for 2018 as compared to 2017. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $594 million to $8,635 million compared to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $8,041 million, mainly due to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda and higher sales volumes for PVC resin and polyethylene, partially offset by lower polyethylene sales prices and lower styrene sales volumes. Income from operations was $1,408 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1,225 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $183 million. The increase in income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was mainly a result of higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda and improved operating rates in the Vinyls segment due to fewer planned turnarounds and unplanned outages, partially offset by higher ethane feedstock costs, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Pre-tax transaction and integration-related costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $33 million, or $0.19 per diluted share after tax, as compared to $29 million in 2017.\n2018 Compared with 2017\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $594 million, or 7%, to $8,635 million in 2018 from $8,041 million in 2017, primarily attributable to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda and higher sales volumes for PVC resin and polyethylene, partially offset by lower polyethylene sales prices and lower styrene sales volumes. Average sales prices for 2018 increased by 5% as compared to 2017. Overall sales volumes increased by 3% in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nGross Profit. Gross profit margin percentage increased to 23% in 2018 from 22% in 2017. The gross profit margin for 2018 was higher primarily due to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda, lower purchased ethylene costs and improved operating rates in the Vinyls segment due to fewer planned turnarounds and unplanned outages, partially offset by higher ethane feedstock costs, as compared to 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $46 million to $445 million in 2018 from $399 million in 2017. This increase was mainly due to an increase in employee compensation and professional consulting fees.\nAmortization of Intangibles. Amortization expense for 2018 was comparable to 2017.\nTransaction and Integration-related Costs. Transaction and integration-related costs were $33 million in 2018 as compared to $29 million in 2017. The transaction and integration-related costs primarily consisted of integration-related consulting fees, severance benefits provided in conjunction with acquisition and reorganization charges.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $33 million to $126 million in 2018 from $159 million in 2017, primarily as a result of lower average debt outstanding for 2018 as compared to 2017. The lower average debt balance in 2018 was mainly due to the redemption of the 2023 Notes in May 2018 and the 2021 Notes in February 2018. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt\" below for further discussion of our indebtedness.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net increased by $37 million to $52 million in 2018 from $15 million in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a one-time pension settlement gain of $14 million, an increase in interest income of $13 million, a net gain of $6 million recognized on the redemption of the 2021 Notes and an increase in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries of $6 million.\nIncome Taxes. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 22% in 2018 as compared to a benefit of 24% in 2017. The effective tax rate in 2018 was higher as compared to 2017, primarily due to the recognition of a $591 million income tax benefit in 2017 as a result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, the U.S. corporate income tax rate was lower in 2018 as compared to 2017. The effective income tax rate in 2018 was above the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state and foreign taxes.\nOlefins Segment\nNet Sales. Net sales decreased by $32 million, or 2%, to $2,019 million in 2018 from $2,051 million in 2017. The decrease was mainly due to lower sales volumes for styrene as a result of a planned turnaround in the second quarter of 2018 and lower polyethylene sales prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for polyethylene and higher sales prices for styrene, as compared to 2017. Average sales prices for the Olefins segment decreased by 1% in 2018 as compared to 2017, while average sales volumes in 2018 were consistent with 2017.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations was $573 million in 2018 as compared to $655 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower margins resulting from higher ethane feedstock costs and lower polyethylene sales prices, partially offset by higher polyethylene sales volumes.\nVinyls Segment\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $626 million, or 10%, to $6,616 million in 2018 from $5,990 million in 2017. This increase was mainly attributable to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda and higher sales volumes for PVC resin as compared to 2017. Average sales volumes increased by 4% in 2018, as compared to 2017, and average sales prices increased by 7% in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations was $913 million in 2018 as compared to $639 million in 2017. This increase was mainly attributable to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda, lower purchased ethylene costs, improved operating rates and lower costs associated with planned turnarounds and unplanned outages, as compared to 2017.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $2,965 million, or 58%, to $8,041 million in 2017 from $5,076 million in 2016, primarily attributable to higher sales volume contributed by Axiall and higher sales prices for our major products. Overall sales volumes increased by 46% in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily attributable to higher sales contributed by Axiall. Average sales prices for 2017 increased by 12% as compared to 2016.\nGross Profit. Gross profit margin percentage increased to 22% in 2017 from 19% in 2016. The gross profit margin for 2017 was higher primarily due to higher sales prices for our major products and higher sales volumes for caustic soda, chlorine and PVC resin contributed primarily by Axiall, as compared to 2016. These increases were offset by higher unabsorbed fixed manufacturing and other costs associated with turnarounds and unplanned outages and a proportionately larger sales volume for the Vinyls segment, for which industry margins in 2017 and 2016 were lower as compared to the Olefins industry.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $141 million, or 55%, in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily because a full year of Axiall's expenses were included in 2017, as compared to only four months in 2016 and an increase in employee compensation.\nAmortization of Intangibles. Amortization of intangibles are comprised of amortization expense for customer relationships, trade name and other intangible assets. The amortization expense increased by $70 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, because a full year of expense related to the intangible assets acquired in the Axiall Merger was included in 2017, as compared to only four months in 2016.\nTransaction and Integration-related Costs. Transaction and integration-related costs were $29 million in 2017 as compared to $104 million in 2016. Transaction and integration-related costs were $75 million lower in 2017 as compared to 2016 predominantly because significant transaction and integration-related costs were incurred at the time of the Axiall Merger in 2016. The transaction and integration-related costs in 2017 primarily consisted of severance benefits provided to former Axiall employees in conjunction with the Axiall Merger and integration costs and consulting fees related to the Axiall Merger. The transaction and integration-related costs in 2016 primarily consisted of severance benefits provided to former Axiall executives in conjunction with the Axiall Merger, including the conversion of Axiall restricted stock units into our restricted stock units, transitional service expenses for certain former Axiall employees, retention agreement costs and consulting and professional fees related to the Axiall Merger.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased by $80 million to $159 million in 2017 from $79 million in 2016, primarily as a result of higher average debt outstanding for the year as well as decreased capitalized interest on major capital projects in 2017 as compared to 2016. The debt balance increased in August 2016 to finance the Axiall Merger. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt\" below for further discussion of our indebtedness.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net decreased by $39 million to $15 million in 2017 from $54 million in 2016. The decrease was mainly attributable to the realized gain in 2016 of $49 million from the previously held common stock of Axiall.\nIncome Taxes. The effective income tax rate was a benefit of 24% in 2017 as compared to an expense of 25% in 2016. The effective income tax rate for 2017 was below the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the $591 million income tax benefit as a result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by a one-time U.S. tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of our post-1986 foreign earnings as part of the Tax Act, the domestic manufacturing deduction, depletion deductions, income attributable to noncontrolling interests, foreign earnings rate differential and foreign withholding tax related to such earnings. The effective income tax rate for 2016 was below the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the benefit of state tax credits, the domestic manufacturing deduction, depletion deductions, income attributable to noncontrolling interests, the non-recognition of tax related to the gain recognized on previously held outstanding shares of common stock of Axiall, the benefit in prior years' and current-year tax credits for increased research and development expenditures and adjustments related to prior years' tax returns as filed, change in state apportionment and the foreign earnings rate differential, partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible transaction costs related to the Axiall Merger.\nOlefins Segment\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $157 million, or 8%, to $2,051 million in 2017 from $1,894 million in 2016, mainly due to higher sales prices for our major products compared to the prior year. Average sales prices for the Olefins segment increased by 9% in 2017 as compared to 2016, while average sales volumes decreased by 1% in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to lower polyethylene sales.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations was $655 million in 2017 as compared to $558 million in 2016. This increase was mainly attributable to higher olefins integrated product margins, primarily due to higher sales prices for our major products, higher operating rates and lower costs associated with turnarounds and unplanned outages as compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by higher energy costs. Income from operations for 2016 was negatively impacted by the planned turnaround and expansion of the Lake Charles Petro 1 ethylene unit along with other unplanned outages. Trading activity for 2017 resulted in a loss of $4 million as compared to a gain of $20 million for 2016.\nVinyls Segment\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $2,808 million, or 88%, to $5,990 million in 2017 from $3,182 million in 2016. This increase was mainly attributable to higher sales volume contributed primarily by Axiall and higher sales prices for our major products. Average sales volumes increased by 74% in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily because a full year of Axiall's operations was included in 2017 as compared to only four months of Axiall's operations included in 2016. Average sales prices for the Vinyls segment increased by 14% in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations was $639 million in 2017 as compared to $176 million in 2016. This increase was mainly attributable to earnings contributed by Axiall and higher sales prices and volumes for our major products. These increases were partially offset by higher unabsorbed fixed manufacturing and other costs associated with the planned turnaround and expansion at the Calvert City facility and other turnarounds and unplanned outages in addition to higher energy costs in 2017, as compared to 2016.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities provided cash of $1,409 million in 2018 compared to cash provided of $1,528 million in 2017. The $119 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in working capital requirements, partially offset by an increase in income from operations in 2018 and lower income taxes for 2018 as a result of the Tax Act, as compared to 2017. Income from operations increased by $183 million in 2018, as compared to the prior year 2017. The increase in income from operations was primarily a result of higher sales price and volume for caustic soda partially offset by higher feedstock costs. Changes in components of working capital, which we define for purposes of this cash flow discussion as accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, used cash of $290 million in 2018, compared to $155 million of cash provided in 2017, an unfavorable change of $445 million. The change was mainly driven by unfavorable changes in inventories, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Unfavorable changes in inventories were primarily the result of higher feedstock costs in 2018, as compared to 2017, and the changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily due to the timing of purchases and payments to suppliers as well as due to a lower income tax accrual as a result of the lower tax rate under the Tax Act.\nOperating activities provided cash of $1,528 million in 2017 compared to cash provided of $867 million in 2016. The $661 million increase in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in income from operations and a decrease in working capital requirements. Income from operations increased by $642 million in 2017, as compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of higher sales prices, resulting in a higher margin, as well as higher earnings contributed by Axiall. Changes in components of working capital, which we define for purposes of this cash flow discussion as accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, less accounts payable and accrued liabilities provided cash of $155 million in 2017, compared to $59 million of cash provided in 2016, a favorable change of $96 million. The favorable change was mainly due to a decrease in cash usage in 2017 of $141 million resulting from higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by higher accounts receivable, resulting in an increase in cash usage of $90 million, as compared to 2016.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities during 2018 was $754 million as compared to net cash used of $652 million in 2017. Capital expenditures were $702 million in 2018 compared to $577 million in 2017. Capital expenditures in 2018 were primarily related to expansion projects as well as projects to improve production capacity or reduce costs, maintenance and safety and environmental projects at our various facilities. The expansion projects include our previously announced ongoing expansions of chlor-alkali, PVC and VCM capacities at our plants in Germany and Geismar. Capital expenditures in 2017 were primarily incurred on the upgrade and expansion of OpCo's Calvert City ethylene plant at our Calvert City site. The remaining capital expenditures in 2017 primarily related to projects to improve production capacity or reduce costs, maintenance and safety and environmental projects at our various facilities. We spent $58 million in 2018 to fund the construction costs of our LACC joint venture, as compared to $66 million in 2017. In addition, we invested $10 million in other unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2018. Please see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Liquidity and Financing Arrangements\" below for further discussion.\nNet cash used for investing activities during 2017 was $652 million as compared to net cash used of $2,563 million in 2016. We used $2,438 million of cash, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Axiall in 2016. Capital expenditures were $577 million in 2017 compared to $629 million in 2016. Capital expenditures in 2017 were incurred on several projects, including the upgrade and expansion of OpCo's Calvert City ethylene plant at our Calvert City site. Capital expenditures in 2016 were primarily incurred on the upgrade and expansion of OpCo's Petro 1 ethylene unit at our Lake Charles site. The remaining capital expenditures in 2017 and 2016 primarily related to projects to improve production capacity or reduce costs, maintenance and safety and environmental projects at our various facilities. In addition, we spent $66 million in 2017 related to our contribution to LACC to fund the construction costs of the ethylene plant, as compared to $17 million in 2016. Please see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Liquidity and Financing Arrangements\" below for further discussion. We did not purchase any securities in 2017 compared to a total of $138 million of securities purchased in 2016. Other 2016 investing activity was related to the receipt of proceeds of $663 million from the sales and maturities of our investments.\nCash provided by operating and investing activities in 2017 and 2016 was retrospectively adjusted as a result of the adoption of accounting standards update No. 2016-18 effective January 1, 2018. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used by financing activities during 2018 was $1,427 million as compared to net cash provided of $6 million in 2017. We used $1,179 million for the repayment of notes payable, of which $704 million was used for the redemption of the 2021 Notes in February 2018 and $461 million was used for the redemption of the 2023 Notes in May 2018 and the remaining balance was used for the repayment of short-term notes payable. The remaining activities in 2018 were primarily related to the $120 million payment of cash dividends, the $45 million payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests, treasury stock repurchases of $106 million and proceeds of $14 million from the issuance of short-term notes payable. The 2017 activity was mainly related to the issuance of notes, drawdown under the Credit Agreement and issuance of Westlake Partners common units, partially offset by repayment of borrowings under the Credit Agreement, the payment of cash dividends, the payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests and the payment of debt issuance costs.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during 2017 was $6 million as compared to net cash provided of $1,687 million in 2016. We received net proceeds in 2017 of $978 million from notes payable and drawdown of revolver which comprised of (1) $495 million from the issuance in November 2017 of the 4.375% Senior Notes due 2047; (2) $250 million from the remarketing in November 2017 of the Refunding Bonds; (3) $225 million from a drawdown under the Credit Agreement; and (4) $8 million issuance of notes payable. Additionally, we received $111 million from the issuance of Westlake Partners common units as a result of its secondary offering in September 2017. In 2017, we used cash of (1) $150 million for the repayment of our prior term loan; (2) $250 million for the redemption of the 6 \u00be% tax exempt revenue bonds due November 2032; and (3) $550 million for the repayment of borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The remaining 2017 activity was primarily related to the $103 million payment of cash dividends, the $28 million payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests, the $6 million payment of debt issuance costs and activities related to Huasu's short-term notes payable to banks in connection with payments of suppliers through letters of credit. The 2016 activity was mainly related to the issuance of senior notes and our prior term loan and borrowings under the Credit Agreement, partially offset by repayment of borrowings under the Credit Agreement, the payment of cash dividends, the payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests, the payment of debt issuance costs and the repurchase of shares of our common stock.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity and Financing Arrangements\nOur principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents, cash from operations, short-term borrowings under the Credit Agreement and our long-term financing.\nOn January 2, 2019, we acquired NAKAN and paid approximately $250 million as the purchase price.\nOn July 24, 2018, we entered into a new $1 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to mature on July 24, 2023. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt-Credit Agreement\" for more information.\nIn November 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a $250 million stock repurchase program (the \"2014 Program\"). In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved the expansion of the 2014 Program by an additional $150 million. In August 2018, our Board of Directors approved the further expansion of the existing 2014 Program by an additional $150 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had repurchased 5,562,479 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $335 million under the 2014 Program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 1,368,881 shares of our common stock were repurchased under the 2014 Program. Purchases under the 2014 Program may be made either through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Decisions regarding the amount and the timing of purchases under the 2014 Program will be influenced by our cash on hand, our cash flow from operations, general market conditions and other factors. The 2014 Program may be discontinued by our Board of Directors at any time.\nWe are party to a joint venture with Lotte Chemical USA Corporation to build an ethylene facility, LACC. The ethylene facility is located adjacent to our vinyls facility in Lake Charles. Pursuant to the contribution and subscription agreement, we agreed to make a maximum capital commitment to LACC of up to $225 million to fund the construction costs of the ethylene plant, which represents approximately 10% of the interests in LACC. The construction of the ethylene plant commenced in January 2016, with an anticipated start-up in the first half of 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had funded approximately $183 million of our portion of the construction costs of the ethylene plant.\nOn February 15 and May 15, 2018, we redeemed all of the 2021 Notes ($688 million aggregate principal amount) and all of the 2023 Notes ($450 million aggregate principal amount), respectively.\nWe believe that our sources of liquidity as described above are adequate to fund our normal operations and ongoing capital expenditures. Funding of any potential large expansions or potential acquisitions would likely necessitate and therefore depend on our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. We may not be able to access additional liquidity at cost effective interest rates due to the volatility of the commercial credit markets.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of December 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $753 million. In addition, we have the Credit Agreement available to supplement cash if needed, as described under \"Debt\" below.\nDebt\nAs of December 31, 2018, our indebtedness, including the current portion, totaled $2,668 million. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness. Defined terms used in this section have the definitions assigned to such terms in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Based on our current level of operations and unless we were to undertake a new expansion or large acquisition, we believe our cash flows from operations, available cash and available borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be adequate to meet our normal operating needs for the foreseeable future.\nCredit Agreement\nOn July 24, 2018, we entered into a new $1 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to mature on July 24, 2023 (the \"Credit Agreement\") and, in connection therewith, terminated the existing $1 billion revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on August 23, 2021 (the \"Prior Credit Agreement\"). The Credit Agreement bears interest at either (a) LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 1.00% to 1.75% or (b) Alternate Base Rate plus a spread ranging from 0.00% to 0.75% in each case depending on the credit rating of the Company. At December 31, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $4 million and borrowing availability of $996 million under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including a quarterly total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains certain events of default and if and for so long as certain events of default have occurred and are continuing, any overdue amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will accrue interest at an increased rate, the lenders can terminate their commitments thereunder and payments of any outstanding amounts could be accelerated by the lenders. None of our subsidiaries are required to guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement includes a $150 million sub-limit for letters of credit, and any outstanding letters of credit will be deducted from availability under the facility. The Credit Agreement also provides for a discretionary $50 million commitment for swingline loans to be provided on a same-day basis. We may also increase the size of the facility, in increments of at least $25 million, up to a maximum of $500 million, subject to certain conditions and if certain lenders agree to commit to such an increase.\nIn connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement and termination of the Prior Credit Agreement on July 24, 2018, all guarantees by our subsidiaries of our payment obligations under the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes, the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes, the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes were released.\nGO Zone Bonds and IKE Zone Bonds\nIn November 2017, the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facility and Development Authority (the \"Authority\") completed the offering of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% tax-exempt revenue refunding bonds due November 1, 2032 (the \"Refunding Bonds\"), the net proceeds of which were used to redeem $250 million aggregate principal amount of the Authority's 6 \u00be% tax-exempt revenue bonds due November 1, 2032 issued by the Authority under the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 (the \"GO Zone Act\") in December 2007. In connection with the issuance of the Refunding Bonds, we issued $250 million of the 3.5% 2032 GO Zone Refunding Senior Notes. The Refunding Bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company at any time on or after November 1, 2027, for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest.\nIn July 2010, the Authority completed the reoffering of $100 million of the 6 \u00bd% 2029 GO Zone Bonds. In connection with the reoffering of the 6 \u00bd% 2029 GO Zone Bonds, we issued $100 million of the 6 \u00bd% 2029 GO Zone Senior Notes. In December 2010, the Authority issued $89 million of the 6 \u00bd% 2035 GO Zone Bonds. In connection with the issuance of the 6 \u00bd% 2035 GO Zone Bonds, we issued $89 million of the 6 \u00bd% 2035 GO Zone Senior Notes. In December 2010, the Authority completed the offering of $65 million of the 6 \u00bd% 2035 IKE Zone Bonds under Section 704 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the \"IKE Zone Act\"). In connection with the issuance of the 6 \u00bd% 2035 IKE Zone Bonds, we issued $65 million of the 6 \u00bd% 2035 IKE Zone Senior Notes.\nThe 6 \u00bd% 2029 GO Zone Bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company at any time prior to August 1, 2020 for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted \"make whole\" payment. On or after August 1, 2020, the 6 \u00bd% 2029 GO Zone Bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest. The 6 \u00bd% 2035 GO Zone Bonds and the 6 \u00bd% 2035 IKE Zone Bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company at any time prior to November 1, 2020 for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted \"make whole\" payment. On or after November 1, 2020, the 6 \u00bd% 2035 GO Zone Bonds and the 6 \u00bd% 2035 IKE Zone Bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\n3.60% Senior Notes due 2026 and 5.0% Senior Notes due 2046\nIn August 2016, we completed the private offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes. In March 2017, the Company commenced registered exchange offers to exchange the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes for new notes that are identical in all material respects to the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes, except that the offer and issuance of the new Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\")-registered notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). The exchange offers expired on April 24, 2017, and approximately 99.97% of the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and 100% of the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes were exchanged. The notes that were not exchanged in the exchange offers have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the U.S. absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements or a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities law.\n3.60% Senior Notes due 2022\nIn July 2012, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes. We may optionally redeem the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes at any time and from time to time prior to April 15, 2022 (three months prior to the maturity date) for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted \"make whole\" payment. On or after April 15, 2022, we may optionally redeem the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest. The holders of the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes may require us to repurchase the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon the occurrence of both a \"change of control\" and, within 60 days of such change of control, a \"below investment grade rating event\" (as such terms are defined in the indenture governing the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes).\n4.375% Senior Notes due 2047\nIn November 2017, we completed the registered public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due November 15, 2047. We may optionally redeem the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes at any time and from time to time prior to May 15, 2047 (six months prior to the maturity date) for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted \"make whole\" payment. On or after May 15, 2047, we may optionally redeem the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes for 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The holders of the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes may require us to repurchase the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase, upon the occurrence of both a \"change of control\" and, within 60 days of such change of control, a \"below investment grade rating event\" (as such terms are defined in the indenture governing the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes). See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\n4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 and 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023\nIn September 2016, we completed offers to exchange (the \"Axiall Exchange Offers\") any and all of the $688 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes and the $450 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% Subsidiary 2023 Senior Notes (together with the 4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes, the \"Subsidiary Notes\") issued by Axiall for new senior notes issued by us having the same maturity and interest rates as the Subsidiary Notes. Pursuant to the Axiall Exchange Offers, $625 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes and $434 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes were exchanged for an identical amount of 4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes and 4.875% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes, respectively, leaving outstanding $63 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes and $16 million aggregate amount of 4.875% Subsidiary 2021 Notes. In December 2017, we delivered notices for the optional redemption of all of the outstanding 4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes and 4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes (collectively, the \"2021 Notes\"). The 2021 Notes were redeemed on February 15, 2018 at a redemption price equal to 102.313% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2021 Notes to the redemption date. In March 2018, we delivered notices for the optional redemption of all of the outstanding Westlake 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023 and 4.875% Subsidiary Notes due 2023 (collectively, the \"2023 Notes\"). The 2023 Notes were redeemed on May 15, 2018 at a redemption price equal to 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2023 Notes to the redemption date.\nRevenue Bonds\nIn December 1997, we entered into a loan agreement with a public trust established for public purposes for the benefit of the Parish of Calcasieu, Louisiana. The public trust issued $11 million principal amount of tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds in order to finance our construction of waste disposal facilities for an ethylene plant. The waste disposal revenue bonds expire in December 2027 and are subject to redemption and mandatory tender for purchase prior to maturity under certain conditions. Interest on the waste disposal revenue bonds accrues at a rate determined by a remarketing agent and is payable quarterly. The interest rate on the waste disposal revenue bonds at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 1.85% and 1.73%, respectively.\nThe indenture governing the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes, the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes, the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes and the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes contains customary events of default and covenants that will restrict us and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to (1) incur certain secured indebtedness, (2) engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions and (3) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our long-term debt covenants.\nWestlake Chemical Partners LP Credit Arrangements\nOur subsidiary, Westlake Chemical Finance Corporation, is the lender party to a $600 million revolving credit facility with Westlake Chemical Partners LP (\"Westlake Partners\"), originally entered into on April 29, 2015. The revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature on April 29, 2021. Borrowings under the revolver bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 2.0% to 3.0% (depending on Westlake Partners' consolidated leverage ratio), payable quarterly. Westlake Partners may pay all or a portion of the interest on any borrowings in kind, in which case any such amounts would be added to the principal amount of the loan. As of December 31, 2018, outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled $254 million and bore interest at the LIBOR rate plus 2.0%.\nOur subsidiary, Westlake Polymers LLP, is the administrative agent to a $600 million revolving credit facility with OpCo. The revolving credit facility was amended on September 25, 2018 to extend the maturity date from August 2019 to September 2023 and to revise the applicable margin from 3.0% to 2.0%. As of December 31, 2018, outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled $224 million and bore interest at the LIBOR rate plus 2.0%, which is accrued in arrears quarterly.\nWe consolidate Westlake Partners and OpCo for financial reporting purposes as we have a controlling financial interest. As such, the revolving credit facilities described above between our subsidiaries and Westlake Partners and OpCo are eliminated upon consolidation.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nIn addition to long-term debt, we are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 relating to long-term debt, operating leases, capital leases, pension benefits funding, post-retirement healthcare benefits, purchase obligations and interest payments for the next five years and thereafter. The amounts do not include deferred charges and other items classified in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet due to the uncertainty of the future payment schedule.\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension benefits funding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Post-retirement healthcare benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment in LACC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Commercial Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPension Benefits Funding. This represents the projected timing of contributions to our defined benefit pension plans which cover certain eligible employees in the United States and non-U.S. countries.\nPost-retirement Healthcare Benefits. This represents the projected timing of contributions to our post-retirement healthcare benefits to the employees of certain subsidiaries who meet certain minimum age and service requirements.\nPurchase Obligations. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including a minimum quantity and price. We are party to various obligations to purchase goods and services, including commitments to purchase various feedstock, utilities, nitrogen, oxygen, product storage, pipeline usage and logistic support, in each case in the ordinary course of our business, as well as various purchase commitments for our capital projects. The amounts shown in the table above reflect our estimates based on the contractual quantities and the prices in effect under contractual agreements as of December 31, 2018.\nInterest Payments. Interest payments are based on interest rates in effect at December 31, 2018.\nAsset retirement obligations. This includes the estimated costs and timing of payments to satisfy our recognized asset retirement obligations.\nInvestment in LACC. This includes our portion of the forecasted capital contributions related to the engineering, procurement and construction of LACC's new ethylene plant.\nStandby Letters of Credit. This includes (1) our obligation under an $11 million letter of credit issued in connection with the $11 million tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds and (2) other letters of credit totaling $26 million issued primarily to support commercial obligations and obligations under our insurance programs, including workers' compensation claims.\nUncertain income tax positions. We have recognized a liability for our uncertain income tax positions of approximately $12 million as of December 31, 2018. We do not believe we are likely to pay any material amounts during the year ending December 31, 2019. The ultimate resolution and timing of payment for remaining matters continues to be uncertain and are therefore excluded from the Contractual Obligations table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions. We have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes and believe those policies are reasonable and appropriate.\nWe apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with GAAP. Our more critical accounting policies include those related to long-lived assets, fair value estimates, accruals for long-term employee benefits, accounts receivable, income taxes and environmental and legal obligations. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates. We periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements.\nLong-Lived Assets. Key estimates related to long-lived assets include useful lives, recoverability of carrying values and existence of any retirement obligations. Such estimates could be significantly modified. The carrying values of long-lived assets could be impaired by significant changes or projected changes in supply and demand fundamentals (which would have a negative impact on operating rates or margins), new technological developments, new competitors with significant raw material or other cost advantages, adverse changes associated with the United States and world economies, the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with governmental actions.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including when negative conditions such as significant current or projected operating losses exist. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions and the operational performance of our businesses. Actual impairment losses incurred could vary significantly from amounts estimated. Long-lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Additionally, future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that associated long-lived assets of our businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe estimated useful lives of long-lived assets range from one to 40 years. Depreciation and amortization of these assets, including amortization of deferred turnaround costs, under the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives totaled $641 million, $601 million and $378 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated, depreciation or amortization charges would be accelerated.\nWe defer the costs of planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, and amortize the costs over the period until the next planned turnaround of the affected unit. Total costs deferred on turnarounds were $79 million, $47 million and $77 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amortization in 2018, 2017 and 2016 of previously deferred turnaround costs was $39 million, $30 million and $22 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, deferred turnaround costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $144 million. Expensing turnaround costs as incurred would likely result in greater variability of our quarterly operating results and would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nAdditional information concerning long-lived assets and related depreciation and amortization appears in Notes 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nFair Value Estimates. We develop estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire a business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, to assess impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and to record marketable securities, derivative instruments and pension plan assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the engagement of third-party consultants. At December 31, 2018, our recorded goodwill was $1,002 million, which was associated with the acquisition of Axiall, our specialty PVC pipe business and our Longview facilities. In addition, we record all derivative instruments, pension plan assets and certain marketable securities at fair value. The fair value of these items is determined by quoted market prices or from observable market-based inputs. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nBusiness Combinations and Intangible Assets Including Goodwill. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill. Any changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded for acquisitions prior to the finalization of more detailed analysis, but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Any subsequent changes to any purchase price allocations that are material to our consolidated financial results will be adjusted in the same period's financial statements, including the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and in-process research and development costs are recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter until completion, at which point the asset is amortized over its expected useful life. Separately recognized transactions associated with business combinations are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date. The application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment assessment for the Olefins and Vinyls reporting units in October and April, respectively. We may elect to perform an optional qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment analysis is required. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors related to raw materials and labor, current and projected financial performance, changes in management or strategy, and market capitalization. Alternatively, we may unconditionally elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in any period. We elected to perform the qualitative assessment for both of our segments' reporting units during 2018 and concluded that quantitative impairment test was not required.\nIf we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or conclude, based on the totality of events or circumstances, it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment analysis is performed. The quantitative analysis compares a reporting unit's fair value to its carrying amount to determine whether goodwill is impaired. The fair values of the reporting units are calculated using both a discounted cash flow methodology and a market value methodology. The discounted cash flow projections are based on a forecast to reflect the cyclicality of the business. The forecast is based on historical results and estimates by management, including its strategic and operational plans, and financial performance of the market. The future cash flows are discounted to present value using an applicable discount rate. The significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit using the market value methodology include the determination of appropriate market comparables and the estimated multiples of EBITDA a willing buyer is likely to pay. Even if the fair values of the reporting units decreased by 10% from the fair values determined in the most recent quantitative tests performed during 2017, the carrying values of the reporting units would not have exceeded their fair values. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-If our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, we may be required to record non-cash charges to earnings, which could be significant.\"\nThe results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\nLong-Term Employee Benefit Costs. Our costs for long-term employee benefits, particularly pension and postretirement medical and life benefits, are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods. The net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. It is our responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that represent the best estimates of those uncertainties. It is also our responsibility to review those assumptions periodically and, if necessary, adjust the assumptions to reflect changes in economic or other factors.\nAccounting for employee retirement plans involves estimating the cost of benefits that are to be provided in the future and attempting to match, for each employee, that estimated cost to the period worked. To accomplish this, we rely extensively on advice from actuaries, and we make assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, employee turnover and discount rates that ultimately impact amounts recorded. Changes in these assumptions may result in different expense and liability amounts. One of the more significant assumptions relates to the discount rate for measuring benefit obligations. At December 31, 2018, the projected pension benefit obligations for U.S. and non-U.S. plans were calculated using assumed weighted average discount rates of 4.1% and 2.0%, respectively. The discount rates were determined using a benchmark pension discount curve and applying spot rates from the curve to each year of expected benefit payments to determine the appropriate discount rate. As a result of the funding relief provided by the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, no minimum funding requirements are expected during 2019 for the U.S. pension plans. Additional information on the 2019 funding requirements and key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appear in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThe following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligation of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-U.S. Plans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected benefit obligation, end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate increases by 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(68\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate decreases by 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA one-percentage point increase or decrease in assumed healthcare trend rates would not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans.\nWhile we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K related to these retirement plans are based on the best estimates and judgments available, the actual outcomes could differ from these estimates.\nIncome Taxes. We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded based upon temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period. Valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nEnvironmental and Legal Obligations. We consult with various professionals to assist us in making estimates relating to environmental costs and legal proceedings. We accrue an expense when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. While we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to these contingencies are based on the best estimates and judgments available, the actual outcomes could differ from our estimates. Additional information about certain legal proceedings and environmental matters appears in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. We recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Initially, the asset retirement obligation is recorded at fair value and capitalized as a component of the carrying value of the long-lived asset to which the obligation relates. The liability is recorded at its future value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, a gain or loss is recorded. We have conditional asset retirement obligations for the removal and disposal of hazardous materials from certain of our manufacturing facilities.\nWe also have conditional asset retirement obligations that have not been recognized because the fair values of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured due to the indeterminate settlement date of the obligations. Settlements of the unrecognized conditional asset retirement obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any individual reporting period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein by reference.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe are a vertically integrated global manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals, polymers and building products. Our two principal operating segments are Olefins and Vinyls. We use the majority of our internally-produced basic chemicals to produce higher value-added chemicals and building products.\nConsumption of the basic chemicals that we manufacture in the commodity portions of our olefins and vinyls processes has increased significantly since we began operations in 1986. Our olefins and vinyls products are some of the most widely used chemicals in the world and are upgraded into a wide variety of higher value-added chemical products used in many end-markets. Petrochemicals are typically manufactured in large volume by a number of different producers using widely available technologies. The petrochemical industry exhibits cyclical commodity characteristics, and margins are influenced by changes in the balance between supply and demand and the resulting operating rates, the level of general economic activity and the price of raw materials. The cycle is generally characterized by periods of tight supply, leading to high operating rates and margins, followed by a decline in operating rates and margins primarily as a result of excess new capacity additions. Due to the significant size of new plants, capacity additions are built in large increments and typically require several years of demand growth to be absorbed.\nEthane-based ethylene producers have in the recent past experienced a cost advantage over naphtha-based ethylene producers during periods of higher crude oil prices. This cost advantage has resulted in a strong export market for polyethylene and other ethylene derivatives and has benefited operating margins and cash flows for our Olefins segment during such periods. However, we have seen a significant reduction in the cost advantage enjoyed by North American ethane-based ethylene producers due to lower crude oil prices from the third quarter of 2014 through 2018, which has resulted in reduced prices and lower margins for our Olefins segment. Further, our Olefins segment has experienced lower profitability in recent periods due to new ethylene and polyethylene capacity additions in North America and Asia that have led to higher global demand for ethane, resulting in higher feedstock costs as well as additional supply of ethylene and polyethylene. Looking forward, new ethylene and polyethylene capacity additions in North America, Asia and the Middle East will add additional supply and may continue to contribute to periods of lower profitability. However, increasing demand driven by strong economic growth may be able to absorb some of such additional supply.\nSince late 2010, the PVC industry in the U.S. has experienced an increase in PVC resin exports, driven largely by more competitive feedstock and energy cost positions in the U.S. As a consequence, the U.S. PVC resin industry operating rates have improved since 2010. In addition, our 2014 acquisition of Vinnolit Holdings GmbH and its subsidiary companies, an integrated global leader in specialty PVC resins, has contributed to improved operating margins and cash flows for our Vinyls segment. With the acquisition of Axiall Corporation (\"Axiall\") in 2016, Westlake is the third-largest chlor-alkali producer and the third-largest PVC producer in the world. Globally, there were large chlor-alkali capacity additions between 2008 and 2015 resulting in excess capacity and lower industry operating rates which exerted downward pressure on caustic soda pricing. Since 2015, the capacity additions have been outpaced by an increase in demand driven by improving economic growth and U.S. producers' competitive export position, which has resulted in improved operating rates and caustic soda pricing. Westlake is the second-largest purchaser of ethylene in the U.S., and lower prices of ethylene could positively impact our Vinyls segment. Our recent acquisition of NAKAN is expected to expand our Vinyls segment's downstream business and increase our global footprint.\nWe purchase significant amounts of ethane feedstock, natural gas, ethylene and salt from external suppliers for use in production of basic chemicals in the olefins and vinyls chains. We also purchase significant amounts of electricity to supply the energy required in our production processes. While we have agreements providing for the supply of ethane feedstock, natural gas, ethylene, salt and electricity, the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile. Factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past, and which may do so in the future include:\n \u2022 the availability of feedstock from shale gas and oil drilling; \n \u2022 supply and demand for crude oil; \n \u2022 shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand; \n \u2022 ethane and liquefied natural gas exports; \n \u2022 capacity constraints due to higher construction costs for investments, construction delays, strike action or involuntary shutdowns; \n \u2022 the general level of business and economic activity; and \n \u2022 the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation. \nSignificant volatility in raw material costs tends to put pressure on product margins as sales price increases could lag behind raw material cost increases. Conversely, when raw material costs decrease, customers may seek immediate relief in the form of lower sales prices. We currently use derivative instruments to reduce price volatility risk on feedstock commodities and lower overall costs. Normally, there is a pricing relationship between a commodity that we process and the feedstock from which it is derived. When this pricing relationship deviates from historical norms, we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments and physical positions in an attempt to take advantage of this relationship.\nOur historical results have been significantly affected by our plant production capacity, our efficient use of that capacity and our ability to increase capacity. Since our inception, we have followed a disciplined growth strategy that focuses on plant acquisitions, new plant construction and internal expansion. We evaluate each expansion project on the basis of its ability to produce sustained returns in excess of our cost of capital and its ability to improve efficiency or reduce operating costs. We also regularly look at acquisition opportunities that would be consistent with, or complimentary to, our overall business strategies. Depending on the size of the acquisition, any such acquisitions could require external financing.\nAs noted above in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" we are subject to extensive environmental regulations, which may impose significant additional costs on our operations in the future. Further, concerns about GHG emissions and their possible effects on climate change has led to the enactment of regulations, and to proposed legislation and additional regulations, that could affect us in the form of increased cost of feedstocks and fuel, other increased costs of production and decreased demand for our products. While we do not expect any of these enactments or proposals to have a material adverse effect on us in the near term, we cannot predict the longer-term effect of any of these regulations or proposals on our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe body of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States is commonly referred to as \"GAAP.\" For this purpose, a non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined by the SEC as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable GAAP measures. In this report, we disclose non-GAAP financial measures, primarily earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"). EBITDA is calculated as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The non-GAAP financial measures described in this Form 10-K are not substitutes for the GAAP measures of earnings and cash flows.\nEBITDA is included in this Form 10-K because our management considers it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, some of which present EBITDA when reporting their results. We regularly evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and/or tax rates by using EBITDA. In addition, we utilize EBITDA in evaluating acquisition targets. Management also believes that EBITDA is a useful tool for measuring our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements, and EBITDA is commonly used by us and our investors to measure our ability to service indebtedness. EBITDA is not a substitute for the GAAP measures of earnings or of cash flows and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. In addition, it should be noted that companies calculate EBITDA differently and, therefore, EBITDA as presented for us may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies. EBITDA has material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and income taxes.\nRecent Developments\nOn January 2, 2019, we completed the acquisition of NAKAN, a global compounding solutions business, for approximately $250 million. NAKAN's products are used in a wide-variety of applications, including in the automotive, building and construction, and medical industries.\nOn October 4, 2018, Westlake Chemical Partners LP (\"Westlake Partners\") and Westlake Chemical Partners GP LLC, the general partner of Westlake Partners, entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the \"ATM Agreement\") with UBS Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (collectively, the \"Managers\"). Pursuant to the terms of the ATM Agreement, Westlake Partners may offer and sell common units representing limited partner interests in Westlake Partners from time to time to, or through, the Managers, as Westlake Partners' sales agents or as principals, having an aggregate offering amount of up to $50 million. Westlake Partners intends to use the net proceeds of sales of the common units for general partnership purposes, including the funding of potential future drop-downs and other acquisitions.\nOn August 17, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase an additional $150 million of shares of our common stock under our 2014 share repurchase program.

Summary\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation was $996 million, or $7.62 per diluted share, on net sales of $8,635 million. This represents a decrease in net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation of $308 million, or $2.38 per diluted share, compared to 2017 net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation of $1,304 million, or $10.00 per diluted share, on net sales of $8,041 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased versus the prior year primarily due to the recognition of a $591 million income tax benefit in 2017 under U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") and higher ethane feedstock costs. These decreases were partially offset by (1) higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda; (2) a lower effective income tax rate resulting from the reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act; (3) lower purchased ethylene costs; (4) higher other income, including a one-time pension settlement gain of $14 million, and higher interest income; and (5) a lower interest expense due to lower average debt outstanding for 2018 as compared to 2017. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $594 million to $8,635 million compared to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $8,041 million, mainly due to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda and higher sales volumes for PVC resin and polyethylene, partially offset by lower polyethylene sales prices and lower styrene sales volumes. Income from operations was $1,408 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1,225 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $183 million. The increase in income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was mainly a result of higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda and improved operating rates in the Vinyls segment due to fewer planned turnarounds and unplanned outages, partially offset by higher ethane feedstock costs, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Pre-tax transaction and integration-related costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $33 million, or $0.19 per diluted share after tax, as compared to $29 million in 2017.\n2018 Compared with 2017\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $594 million, or 7%, to $8,635 million in 2018 from $8,041 million in 2017, primarily attributable to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda and higher sales volumes for PVC resin and polyethylene, partially offset by lower polyethylene sales prices and lower styrene sales volumes. Average sales prices for 2018 increased by 5% as compared to 2017. Overall sales volumes increased by 3% in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nGross Profit. Gross profit margin percentage increased to 23% in 2018 from 22% in 2017. The gross profit margin for 2018 was higher primarily due to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda, lower purchased ethylene costs and improved operating rates in the Vinyls segment due to fewer planned turnarounds and unplanned outages, partially offset by higher ethane feedstock costs, as compared to 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $46 million to $445 million in 2018 from $399 million in 2017. This increase was mainly due to an increase in employee compensation and professional consulting fees.\nAmortization of Intangibles. Amortization expense for 2018 was comparable to 2017.\nTransaction and Integration-related Costs. Transaction and integration-related costs were $33 million in 2018 as compared to $29 million in 2017. The transaction and integration-related costs primarily consisted of integration-related consulting fees, severance benefits provided in conjunction with acquisition and reorganization charges.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $33 million to $126 million in 2018 from $159 million in 2017, primarily as a result of lower average debt outstanding for 2018 as compared to 2017. The lower average debt balance in 2018 was mainly due to the redemption of the 2023 Notes in May 2018 and the 2021 Notes in February 2018. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt\" below for further discussion of our indebtedness.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net increased by $37 million to $52 million in 2018 from $15 million in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a one-time pension settlement gain of $14 million, an increase in interest income of $13 million, a net gain of $6 million recognized on the redemption of the 2021 Notes and an increase in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries of $6 million.\nIncome Taxes. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 22% in 2018 as compared to a benefit of 24% in 2017. The effective tax rate in 2018 was higher as compared to 2017, primarily due to the recognition of a $591 million income tax benefit in 2017 as a result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, the U.S. corporate income tax rate was lower in 2018 as compared to 2017. The effective income tax rate in 2018 was above the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state and foreign taxes.\nOlefins Segment\nNet Sales. Net sales decreased by $32 million, or 2%, to $2,019 million in 2018 from $2,051 million in 2017. The decrease was mainly due to lower sales volumes for styrene as a result of a planned turnaround in the second quarter of 2018 and lower polyethylene sales prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for polyethylene and higher sales prices for styrene, as compared to 2017. Average sales prices for the Olefins segment decreased by 1% in 2018 as compared to 2017, while average sales volumes in 2018 were consistent with 2017.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations was $573 million in 2018 as compared to $655 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower margins resulting from higher ethane feedstock costs and lower polyethylene sales prices, partially offset by higher polyethylene sales volumes.\nVinyls Segment\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $626 million, or 10%, to $6,616 million in 2018 from $5,990 million in 2017. This increase was mainly attributable to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda and higher sales volumes for PVC resin as compared to 2017. Average sales volumes increased by 4% in 2018, as compared to 2017, and average sales prices increased by 7% in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations was $913 million in 2018 as compared to $639 million in 2017. This increase was mainly attributable to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda, lower purchased ethylene costs, improved operating rates and lower costs associated with planned turnarounds and unplanned outages, as compared to 2017.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $2,965 million, or 58%, to $8,041 million in 2017 from $5,076 million in 2016, primarily attributable to higher sales volume contributed by Axiall and higher sales prices for our major products. Overall sales volumes increased by 46% in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily attributable to higher sales contributed by Axiall. Average sales prices for 2017 increased by 12% as compared to 2016.\nGross Profit. Gross profit margin percentage increased to 22% in 2017 from 19% in 2016. The gross profit margin for 2017 was higher primarily due to higher sales prices for our major products and higher sales volumes for caustic soda, chlorine and PVC resin contributed primarily by Axiall, as compared to 2016. These increases were offset by higher unabsorbed fixed manufacturing and other costs associated with turnarounds and unplanned outages and a proportionately larger sales volume for the Vinyls segment, for which industry margins in 2017 and 2016 were lower as compared to the Olefins industry.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $141 million, or 55%, in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily because a full year of Axiall's expenses were included in 2017, as compared to only four months in 2016 and an increase in employee compensation.\nAmortization of Intangibles. Amortization of intangibles are comprised of amortization expense for customer relationships, trade name and other intangible assets. The amortization expense increased by $70 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, because a full year of expense related to the intangible assets acquired in the Axiall Merger was included in 2017, as compared to only four months in 2016.\nTransaction and Integration-related Costs. Transaction and integration-related costs were $29 million in 2017 as compared to $104 million in 2016. Transaction and integration-related costs were $75 million lower in 2017 as compared to 2016 predominantly because significant transaction and integration-related costs were incurred at the time of the Axiall Merger in 2016. The transaction and integration-related costs in 2017 primarily consisted of severance benefits provided to former Axiall employees in conjunction with the Axiall Merger and integration costs and consulting fees related to the Axiall Merger. The transaction and integration-related costs in 2016 primarily consisted of severance benefits provided to former Axiall executives in conjunction with the Axiall Merger, including the conversion of Axiall restricted stock units into our restricted stock units, transitional service expenses for certain former Axiall employees, retention agreement costs and consulting and professional fees related to the Axiall Merger.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased by $80 million to $159 million in 2017 from $79 million in 2016, primarily as a result of higher average debt outstanding for the year as well as decreased capitalized interest on major capital projects in 2017 as compared to 2016. The debt balance increased in August 2016 to finance the Axiall Merger. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt\" below for further discussion of our indebtedness.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net decreased by $39 million to $15 million in 2017 from $54 million in 2016. The decrease was mainly attributable to the realized gain in 2016 of $49 million from the previously held common stock of Axiall.\nIncome Taxes. The effective income tax rate was a benefit of 24% in 2017 as compared to an expense of 25% in 2016. The effective income tax rate for 2017 was below the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the $591 million income tax benefit as a result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by a one-time U.S. tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of our post-1986 foreign earnings as part of the Tax Act, the domestic manufacturing deduction, depletion deductions, income attributable to noncontrolling interests, foreign earnings rate differential and foreign withholding tax related to such earnings. The effective income tax rate for 2016 was below the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the benefit of state tax credits, the domestic manufacturing deduction, depletion deductions, income attributable to noncontrolling interests, the non-recognition of tax related to the gain recognized on previously held outstanding shares of common stock of Axiall, the benefit in prior years' and current-year tax credits for increased research and development expenditures and adjustments related to prior years' tax returns as filed, change in state apportionment and the foreign earnings rate differential, partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible transaction costs related to the Axiall Merger.\nOlefins Segment\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $157 million, or 8%, to $2,051 million in 2017 from $1,894 million in 2016, mainly due to higher sales prices for our major products compared to the prior year. Average sales prices for the Olefins segment increased by 9% in 2017 as compared to 2016, while average sales volumes decreased by 1% in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to lower polyethylene sales.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations was $655 million in 2017 as compared to $558 million in 2016. This increase was mainly attributable to higher olefins integrated product margins, primarily due to higher sales prices for our major products, higher operating rates and lower costs associated with turnarounds and unplanned outages as compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by higher energy costs. Income from operations for 2016 was negatively impacted by the planned turnaround and expansion of the Lake Charles Petro 1 ethylene unit along with other unplanned outages. Trading activity for 2017 resulted in a loss of $4 million as compared to a gain of $20 million for 2016.\nVinyls Segment\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $2,808 million, or 88%, to $5,990 million in 2017 from $3,182 million in 2016. This increase was mainly attributable to higher sales volume contributed primarily by Axiall and higher sales prices for our major products. Average sales volumes increased by 74% in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily because a full year of Axiall's operations was included in 2017 as compared to only four months of Axiall's operations included in 2016. Average sales prices for the Vinyls segment increased by 14% in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations was $639 million in 2017 as compared to $176 million in 2016. This increase was mainly attributable to earnings contributed by Axiall and higher sales prices and volumes for our major products. These increases were partially offset by higher unabsorbed fixed manufacturing and other costs associated with the planned turnaround and expansion at the Calvert City facility and other turnarounds and unplanned outages in addition to higher energy costs in 2017, as compared to 2016.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities provided cash of $1,409 million in 2018 compared to cash provided of $1,528 million in 2017. The $119 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in working capital requirements, partially offset by an increase in income from operations in 2018 and lower income taxes for 2018 as a result of the Tax Act, as compared to 2017. Income from operations increased by $183 million in 2018, as compared to the prior year 2017. The increase in income from operations was primarily a result of higher sales price and volume for caustic soda partially offset by higher feedstock costs. Changes in components of working capital, which we define for purposes of this cash flow discussion as accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, used cash of $290 million in 2018, compared to $155 million of cash provided in 2017, an unfavorable change of $445 million. The change was mainly driven by unfavorable changes in inventories, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Unfavorable changes in inventories were primarily the result of higher feedstock costs in 2018, as compared to 2017, and the changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily due to the timing of purchases and payments to suppliers as well as due to a lower income tax accrual as a result of the lower tax rate under the Tax Act.\nOperating activities provided cash of $1,528 million in 2017 compared to cash provided of $867 million in 2016. The $661 million increase in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in income from operations and a decrease in working capital requirements. Income from operations increased by $642 million in 2017, as compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of higher sales prices, resulting in a higher margin, as well as higher earnings contributed by Axiall. Changes in components of working capital, which we define for purposes of this cash flow discussion as accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, less accounts payable and accrued liabilities provided cash of $155 million in 2017, compared to $59 million of cash provided in 2016, a favorable change of $96 million. The favorable change was mainly due to a decrease in cash usage in 2017 of $141 million resulting from higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by higher accounts receivable, resulting in an increase in cash usage of $90 million, as compared to 2016.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities during 2018 was $754 million as compared to net cash used of $652 million in 2017. Capital expenditures were $702 million in 2018 compared to $577 million in 2017. Capital expenditures in 2018 were primarily related to expansion projects as well as projects to improve production capacity or reduce costs, maintenance and safety and environmental projects at our various facilities. The expansion projects include our previously announced ongoing expansions of chlor-alkali, PVC and VCM capacities at our plants in Germany and Geismar. Capital expenditures in 2017 were primarily incurred on the upgrade and expansion of OpCo's Calvert City ethylene plant at our Calvert City site. The remaining capital expenditures in 2017 primarily related to projects to improve production capacity or reduce costs, maintenance and safety and environmental projects at our various facilities. We spent $58 million in 2018 to fund the construction costs of our LACC joint venture, as compared to $66 million in 2017. In addition, we invested $10 million in other unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2018. Please see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Liquidity and Financing Arrangements\" below for further discussion.\nNet cash used for investing activities during 2017 was $652 million as compared to net cash used of $2,563 million in 2016. We used $2,438 million of cash, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Axiall in 2016. Capital expenditures were $577 million in 2017 compared to $629 million in 2016. Capital expenditures in 2017 were incurred on several projects, including the upgrade and expansion of OpCo's Calvert City ethylene plant at our Calvert City site. Capital expenditures in 2016 were primarily incurred on the upgrade and expansion of OpCo's Petro 1 ethylene unit at our Lake Charles site. The remaining capital expenditures in 2017 and 2016 primarily related to projects to improve production capacity or reduce costs, maintenance and safety and environmental projects at our various facilities. In addition, we spent $66 million in 2017 related to our contribution to LACC to fund the construction costs of the ethylene plant, as compared to $17 million in 2016. Please see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Liquidity and Financing Arrangements\" below for further discussion. We did not purchase any securities in 2017 compared to a total of $138 million of securities purchased in 2016. Other 2016 investing activity was related to the receipt of proceeds of $663 million from the sales and maturities of our investments.\nCash provided by operating and investing activities in 2017 and 2016 was retrospectively adjusted as a result of the adoption of accounting standards update No. 2016-18 effective January 1, 2018. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used by financing activities during 2018 was $1,427 million as compared to net cash provided of $6 million in 2017. We used $1,179 million for the repayment of notes payable, of which $704 million was used for the redemption of the 2021 Notes in February 2018 and $461 million was used for the redemption of the 2023 Notes in May 2018 and the remaining balance was used for the repayment of short-term notes payable. The remaining activities in 2018 were primarily related to the $120 million payment of cash dividends, the $45 million payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests, treasury stock repurchases of $106 million and proceeds of $14 million from the issuance of short-term notes payable. The 2017 activity was mainly related to the issuance of notes, drawdown under the Credit Agreement and issuance of Westlake Partners common units, partially offset by repayment of borrowings under the Credit Agreement, the payment of cash dividends, the payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests and the payment of debt issuance costs.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during 2017 was $6 million as compared to net cash provided of $1,687 million in 2016. We received net proceeds in 2017 of $978 million from notes payable and drawdown of revolver which comprised of (1) $495 million from the issuance in November 2017 of the 4.375% Senior Notes due 2047; (2) $250 million from the remarketing in November 2017 of the Refunding Bonds; (3) $225 million from a drawdown under the Credit Agreement; and (4) $8 million issuance of notes payable. Additionally, we received $111 million from the issuance of Westlake Partners common units as a result of its secondary offering in September 2017. In 2017, we used cash of (1) $150 million for the repayment of our prior term loan; (2) $250 million for the redemption of the 6 \u00be% tax exempt revenue bonds due November 2032; and (3) $550 million for the repayment of borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The remaining 2017 activity was primarily related to the $103 million payment of cash dividends, the $28 million payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests, the $6 million payment of debt issuance costs and activities related to Huasu's short-term notes payable to banks in connection with payments of suppliers through letters of credit. The 2016 activity was mainly related to the issuance of senior notes and our prior term loan and borrowings under the Credit Agreement, partially offset by repayment of borrowings under the Credit Agreement, the payment of cash dividends, the payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests, the payment of debt issuance costs and the repurchase of shares of our common stock.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity and Financing Arrangements\nOur principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents, cash from operations, short-term borrowings under the Credit Agreement and our long-term financing.\nOn January 2, 2019, we acquired NAKAN and paid approximately $250 million as the purchase price.\nOn July 24, 2018, we entered into a new $1 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to mature on July 24, 2023. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt-Credit Agreement\" for more information.\nIn November 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a $250 million stock repurchase program (the \"2014 Program\"). In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved the expansion of the 2014 Program by an additional $150 million. In August 2018, our Board of Directors approved the further expansion of the existing 2014 Program by an additional $150 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had repurchased 5,562,479 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $335 million under the 2014 Program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 1,368,881 shares of our common stock were repurchased under the 2014 Program. Purchases under the 2014 Program may be made either through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Decisions regarding the amount and the timing of purchases under the 2014 Program will be influenced by our cash on hand, our cash flow from operations, general market conditions and other factors. The 2014 Program may be discontinued by our Board of Directors at any time.\nWe are party to a joint venture with Lotte Chemical USA Corporation to build an ethylene facility, LACC. The ethylene facility is located adjacent to our vinyls facility in Lake Charles. Pursuant to the contribution and subscription agreement, we agreed to make a maximum capital commitment to LACC of up to $225 million to fund the construction costs of the ethylene plant, which represents approximately 10% of the interests in LACC. The construction of the ethylene plant commenced in January 2016, with an anticipated start-up in the first half of 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had funded approximately $183 million of our portion of the construction costs of the ethylene plant.\nOn February 15 and May 15, 2018, we redeemed all of the 2021 Notes ($688 million aggregate principal amount) and all of the 2023 Notes ($450 million aggregate principal amount), respectively.\nWe believe that our sources of liquidity as described above are adequate to fund our normal operations and ongoing capital expenditures. Funding of any potential large expansions or potential acquisitions would likely necessitate and therefore depend on our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. We may not be able to access additional liquidity at cost effective interest rates due to the volatility of the commercial credit markets.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of December 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $753 million. In addition, we have the Credit Agreement available to supplement cash if needed, as described under \"Debt\" below.\nDebt\nAs of December 31, 2018, our indebtedness, including the current portion, totaled $2,668 million. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness. Defined terms used in this section have the definitions assigned to such terms in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Based on our current level of operations and unless we were to undertake a new expansion or large acquisition, we believe our cash flows from operations, available cash and available borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be adequate to meet our normal operating needs for the foreseeable future.\nCredit Agreement\nOn July 24, 2018, we entered into a new $1 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to mature on July 24, 2023 (the \"Credit Agreement\") and, in connection therewith, terminated the existing $1 billion revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on August 23, 2021 (the \"Prior Credit Agreement\"). The Credit Agreement bears interest at either (a) LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 1.00% to 1.75% or (b) Alternate Base Rate plus a spread ranging from 0.00% to 0.75% in each case depending on the credit rating of the Company. At December 31, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $4 million and borrowing availability of $996 million under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including a quarterly total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains certain events of default and if and for so long as certain events of default have occurred and are continuing, any overdue amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will accrue interest at an increased rate, the lenders can terminate their commitments thereunder and payments of any outstanding amounts could be accelerated by the lenders. None of our subsidiaries are required to guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement includes a $150 million sub-limit for letters of credit, and any outstanding letters of credit will be deducted from availability under the facility. The Credit Agreement also provides for a discretionary $50 million commitment for swingline loans to be provided on a same-day basis. We may also increase the size of the facility, in increments of at least $25 million, up to a maximum of $500 million, subject to certain conditions and if certain lenders agree to commit to such an increase.\nIn connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement and termination of the Prior Credit Agreement on July 24, 2018, all guarantees by our subsidiaries of our payment obligations under the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes, the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes, the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes were released.\nGO Zone Bonds and IKE Zone Bonds\nIn November 2017, the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facility and Development Authority (the \"Authority\") completed the offering of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% tax-exempt revenue refunding bonds due November 1, 2032 (the \"Refunding Bonds\"), the net proceeds of which were used to redeem $250 million aggregate principal amount of the Authority's 6 \u00be% tax-exempt revenue bonds due November 1, 2032 issued by the Authority under the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 (the \"GO Zone Act\") in December 2007. In connection with the issuance of the Refunding Bonds, we issued $250 million of the 3.5% 2032 GO Zone Refunding Senior Notes.

In connection with the issuance of the 6 \u00bd% 2035 IKE Zone Bonds, we issued $65 million of the 6 \u00bd% 2035 IKE Zone Senior Notes.\nThe 6 \u00bd% 2029 GO Zone Bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company at any time prior to August 1, 2020 for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted \"make whole\" payment.

See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\n3.60% Senior Notes due 2026 and 5.0% Senior Notes due 2046\nIn August 2016, we completed the private offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes. In March 2017, the Company commenced registered exchange offers to exchange the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes for new notes that are identical in all material respects to the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes, except that the offer and issuance of the new Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\")-registered notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). The exchange offers expired on April 24, 2017, and approximately 99.97% of the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and 100% of the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes were exchanged. The notes that were not exchanged in the exchange offers have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the U.S. absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements or a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities law.\n3.60% Senior Notes due 2022\nIn July 2012, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes. We may optionally redeem the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes at any time and from time to time prior to April 15, 2022 (three months prior to the maturity date) for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted \"make whole\" payment. On or after April 15, 2022, we may optionally redeem the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest.

See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\n4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 and 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023\nIn September 2016, we completed offers to exchange (the \"Axiall Exchange Offers\") any and all of the $688 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes and the $450 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% Subsidiary 2023 Senior Notes (together with the 4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes, the \"Subsidiary Notes\") issued by Axiall for new senior notes issued by us having the same maturity and interest rates as the Subsidiary Notes. Pursuant to the Axiall Exchange Offers, $625 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes and $434 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes were exchanged for an identical amount of 4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes and 4.875% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes, respectively, leaving outstanding $63 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes and $16 million aggregate amount of 4.875% Subsidiary 2021 Notes.

The public trust issued $11 million principal amount of tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds in order to finance our construction of waste disposal facilities for an ethylene plant. The waste disposal revenue bonds expire in December 2027 and are subject to redemption and mandatory tender for purchase prior to maturity under certain conditions. Interest on the waste disposal revenue bonds accrues at a rate determined by a remarketing agent and is payable quarterly. The interest rate on the waste disposal revenue bonds at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 1.85% and 1.73%, respectively.\nThe indenture governing the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes, the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes, the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes and the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes contains customary events of default and covenants that will restrict us and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to (1) incur certain secured indebtedness, (2) engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions and (3) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our long-term debt covenants.\nWestlake Chemical Partners LP Credit Arrangements\nOur subsidiary, Westlake Chemical Finance Corporation, is the lender party to a $600 million revolving credit facility with Westlake Chemical Partners LP (\"Westlake Partners\"), originally entered into on April 29, 2015. The revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature on April 29, 2021. Borrowings under the revolver bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 2.0% to 3.0% (depending on Westlake Partners' consolidated leverage ratio), payable quarterly. Westlake Partners may pay all or a portion of the interest on any borrowings in kind, in which case any such amounts would be added to the principal amount of the loan. As of December 31, 2018, outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled $254 million and bore interest at the LIBOR rate plus 2.0%.\nOur subsidiary, Westlake Polymers LLP, is the administrative agent to a $600 million revolving credit facility with OpCo. The revolving credit facility was amended on September 25, 2018 to extend the maturity date from August 2019 to September 2023 and to revise the applicable margin from 3.0% to 2.0%. As of December 31, 2018, outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled $224 million and bore interest at the LIBOR rate plus 2.0%, which is accrued in arrears quarterly.\nWe consolidate Westlake Partners and OpCo for financial reporting purposes as we have a controlling financial interest. As such, the revolving credit facilities described above between our subsidiaries and Westlake Partners and OpCo are eliminated upon consolidation.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nIn addition to long-term debt, we are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 relating to long-term debt, operating leases, capital leases, pension benefits funding, post-retirement healthcare benefits, purchase obligations and interest payments for the next five years and thereafter. The amounts do not include deferred charges and other items classified in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet due to the uncertainty of the future payment schedule.\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020-2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension benefits funding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Post-retirement healthcare benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment in LACC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Commercial Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPension Benefits Funding. This represents the projected timing of contributions to our defined benefit pension plans which cover certain eligible employees in the United States and non-U.S. countries.\nPost-retirement Healthcare Benefits. This represents the projected timing of contributions to our post-retirement healthcare benefits to the employees of certain subsidiaries who meet certain minimum age and service requirements.\nPurchase Obligations. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including a minimum quantity and price. We are party to various obligations to purchase goods and services, including commitments to purchase various feedstock, utilities, nitrogen, oxygen, product storage, pipeline usage and logistic support, in each case in the ordinary course of our business, as well as various purchase commitments for our capital projects. The amounts shown in the table above reflect our estimates based on the contractual quantities and the prices in effect under contractual agreements as of December 31, 2018.\nInterest Payments. Interest payments are based on interest rates in effect at December 31, 2018.\nAsset retirement obligations. This includes the estimated costs and timing of payments to satisfy our recognized asset retirement obligations.\nInvestment in LACC. This includes our portion of the forecasted capital contributions related to the engineering, procurement and construction of LACC's new ethylene plant.\nStandby Letters of Credit. This includes (1) our obligation under an $11 million letter of credit issued in connection with the $11 million tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds and (2) other letters of credit totaling $26 million issued primarily to support commercial obligations and obligations under our insurance programs, including workers' compensation claims.\nUncertain income tax positions. We have recognized a liability for our uncertain income tax positions of approximately $12 million as of December 31, 2018. We do not believe we are likely to pay any material amounts during the year ending December 31, 2019. The ultimate resolution and timing of payment for remaining matters continues to be uncertain and are therefore excluded from the Contractual Obligations table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions. We have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes and believe those policies are reasonable and appropriate.\nWe apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with GAAP. Our more critical accounting policies include those related to long-lived assets, fair value estimates, accruals for long-term employee benefits, accounts receivable, income taxes and environmental and legal obligations. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates. We periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements.\nLong-Lived Assets. Key estimates related to long-lived assets include useful lives, recoverability of carrying values and existence of any retirement obligations. Such estimates could be significantly modified. The carrying values of long-lived assets could be impaired by significant changes or projected changes in supply and demand fundamentals (which would have a negative impact on operating rates or margins), new technological developments, new competitors with significant raw material or other cost advantages, adverse changes associated with the United States and world economies, the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with governmental actions.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including when negative conditions such as significant current or projected operating losses exist. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions and the operational performance of our businesses. Actual impairment losses incurred could vary significantly from amounts estimated. Long-lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Additionally, future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that associated long-lived assets of our businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe estimated useful lives of long-lived assets range from one to 40 years. Depreciation and amortization of these assets, including amortization of deferred turnaround costs, under the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives totaled $641 million, $601 million and $378 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated, depreciation or amortization charges would be accelerated.\nWe defer the costs of planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, and amortize the costs over the period until the next planned turnaround of the affected unit. Total costs deferred on turnarounds were $79 million, $47 million and $77 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amortization in 2018, 2017 and 2016 of previously deferred turnaround costs was $39 million, $30 million and $22 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, deferred turnaround costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $144 million. Expensing turnaround costs as incurred would likely result in greater variability of our quarterly operating results and would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nAdditional information concerning long-lived assets and related depreciation and amortization appears in Notes 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nFair Value Estimates. We develop estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire a business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, to assess impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and to record marketable securities, derivative instruments and pension plan assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the engagement of third-party consultants. At December 31, 2018, our recorded goodwill was $1,002 million, which was associated with the acquisition of Axiall, our specialty PVC pipe business and our Longview facilities. In addition, we record all derivative instruments, pension plan assets and certain marketable securities at fair value. The fair value of these items is determined by quoted market prices or from observable market-based inputs. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nBusiness Combinations and Intangible Assets Including Goodwill. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill. Any changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded for acquisitions prior to the finalization of more detailed analysis, but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Any subsequent changes to any purchase price allocations that are material to our consolidated financial results will be adjusted in the same period's financial statements, including the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and in-process research and development costs are recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter until completion, at which point the asset is amortized over its expected useful life. Separately recognized transactions associated with business combinations are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date. The application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment assessment for the Olefins and Vinyls reporting units in October and April, respectively. We may elect to perform an optional qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment analysis is required. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors related to raw materials and labor, current and projected financial performance, changes in management or strategy, and market capitalization. Alternatively, we may unconditionally elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in any period. We elected to perform the qualitative assessment for both of our segments' reporting units during 2018 and concluded that quantitative impairment test was not required.\nIf we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or conclude, based on the totality of events or circumstances, it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment analysis is performed. The quantitative analysis compares a reporting unit's fair value to its carrying amount to determine whether goodwill is impaired. The fair values of the reporting units are calculated using both a discounted cash flow methodology and a market value methodology. The discounted cash flow projections are based on a forecast to reflect the cyclicality of the business. The forecast is based on historical results and estimates by management, including its strategic and operational plans, and financial performance of the market. The future cash flows are discounted to present value using an applicable discount rate. The significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit using the market value methodology include the determination of appropriate market comparables and the estimated multiples of EBITDA a willing buyer is likely to pay. Even if the fair values of the reporting units decreased by 10% from the fair values determined in the most recent quantitative tests performed during 2017, the carrying values of the reporting units would not have exceeded their fair values. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-If our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, we may be required to record non-cash charges to earnings, which could be significant.\"\nThe results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\nLong-Term Employee Benefit Costs. Our costs for long-term employee benefits, particularly pension and postretirement medical and life benefits, are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods. The net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. It is our responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that represent the best estimates of those uncertainties. It is also our responsibility to review those assumptions periodically and, if necessary, adjust the assumptions to reflect changes in economic or other factors.\nAccounting for employee retirement plans involves estimating the cost of benefits that are to be provided in the future and attempting to match, for each employee, that estimated cost to the period worked. To accomplish this, we rely extensively on advice from actuaries, and we make assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, employee turnover and discount rates that ultimately impact amounts recorded. Changes in these assumptions may result in different expense and liability amounts. One of the more significant assumptions relates to the discount rate for measuring benefit obligations. At December 31, 2018, the projected pension benefit obligations for U.S. and non-U.S. plans were calculated using assumed weighted average discount rates of 4.1% and 2.0%, respectively. The discount rates were determined using a benchmark pension discount curve and applying spot rates from the curve to each year of expected benefit payments to determine the appropriate discount rate. As a result of the funding relief provided by the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, no minimum funding requirements are expected during 2019 for the U.S. pension plans. Additional information on the 2019 funding requirements and key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appear in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThe following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligation of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>U.S. Plans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-U.S. Plans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected benefit obligation, end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate increases by 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(68\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate decreases by 100 basis points\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA one-percentage point increase or decrease in assumed healthcare trend rates would not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans.\nWhile we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K related to these retirement plans are based on the best estimates and judgments available, the actual outcomes could differ from these estimates.\nIncome Taxes. We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded based upon temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period. Valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nEnvironmental and Legal Obligations. We consult with various professionals to assist us in making estimates relating to environmental costs and legal proceedings. We accrue an expense when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. While we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to these contingencies are based on the best estimates and judgments available, the actual outcomes could differ from our estimates. Additional information about certain legal proceedings and environmental matters appears in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. We recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Initially, the asset retirement obligation is recorded at fair value and capitalized as a component of the carrying value of the long-lived asset to which the obligation relates. The liability is recorded at its future value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, a gain or loss is recorded. We have conditional asset retirement obligations for the removal and disposal of hazardous materials from certain of our manufacturing facilities.\nWe also have conditional asset retirement obligations that have not been recognized because the fair values of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured due to the indeterminate settlement date of the obligations. Settlements of the unrecognized conditional asset retirement obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any individual reporting period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition, which is incorporated herein by reference.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nWe are a vertically integrated global manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals, polymers and building products. Our two principal operating segments are Olefins and Vinyls. We use the majority of our internally-produced basic chemicals to produce higher value-added chemicals and building products.\nConsumption of the basic chemicals that we manufacture in the commodity portions of our olefins and vinyls processes has increased significantly since we began operations in 1986. Our olefins and vinyls products are some of the most widely used chemicals in the world and are upgraded into a wide variety of higher value-added chemical products used in many end-markets. Petrochemicals are typically manufactured in large volume by a number of different producers using widely available technologies. The petrochemical industry exhibits cyclical commodity characteristics, and margins are influenced by changes in the balance between supply and demand and the resulting operating rates, the level of general economic activity and the price of raw materials. The cycle is generally characterized by periods of tight supply, leading to high operating rates and margins, followed by a decline in operating rates and margins primarily as a result of excess new capacity additions. Due to the significant size of new plants, capacity additions are built in large increments and typically require several years of demand growth to be absorbed.\nEthane-based ethylene producers have in the recent past experienced a cost advantage over naphtha-based ethylene producers during periods of higher crude oil prices. This cost advantage has resulted in a strong export market for polyethylene and other ethylene derivatives and has benefited operating margins and cash flows for our Olefins segment during such periods. However, we have seen a significant reduction in the cost advantage enjoyed by North American ethane-based ethylene producers due to lower crude oil prices from the third quarter of 2014 through 2018, which has resulted in reduced prices and lower margins for our Olefins segment. Further, our Olefins segment has experienced lower profitability in recent periods due to new ethylene and polyethylene capacity additions in North America and Asia that have led to higher global demand for ethane, resulting in higher feedstock costs as well as additional supply of ethylene and polyethylene. Looking forward, new ethylene and polyethylene capacity additions in North America, Asia and the Middle East will add additional supply and may continue to contribute to periods of lower profitability. However, increasing demand driven by strong economic growth may be able to absorb some of such additional supply.\nSince late 2010, the PVC industry in the U.S. has experienced an increase in PVC resin exports, driven largely by more competitive feedstock and energy cost positions in the U.S. As a consequence, the U.S. PVC resin industry operating rates have improved since 2010. In addition, our 2014 acquisition of Vinnolit Holdings GmbH and its subsidiary companies, an integrated global leader in specialty PVC resins, has contributed to improved operating margins and cash flows for our Vinyls segment. With the acquisition of Axiall Corporation (\"Axiall\") in 2016, Westlake is the third-largest chlor-alkali producer and the third-largest PVC producer in the world. Globally, there were large chlor-alkali capacity additions between 2008 and 2015 resulting in excess capacity and lower industry operating rates which exerted downward pressure on caustic soda pricing. Since 2015, the capacity additions have been outpaced by an increase in demand driven by improving economic growth and U.S. producers' competitive export position, which has resulted in improved operating rates and caustic soda pricing. Westlake is the second-largest purchaser of ethylene in the U.S., and lower prices of ethylene could positively impact our Vinyls segment. Our recent acquisition of NAKAN is expected to expand our Vinyls segment's downstream business and increase our global footprint.\nWe purchase significant amounts of ethane feedstock, natural gas, ethylene and salt from external suppliers for use in production of basic chemicals in the olefins and vinyls chains. We also purchase significant amounts of electricity to supply the energy required in our production processes. While we have agreements providing for the supply of ethane feedstock, natural gas, ethylene, salt and electricity, the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile. Factors that have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past, and which may do so in the future include:\n \u2022 the availability of feedstock from shale gas and oil drilling; \n \u2022 supply and demand for crude oil; \n \u2022 shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand; \n \u2022 ethane and liquefied natural gas exports; \n \u2022 capacity constraints due to higher construction costs for investments, construction delays, strike action or involuntary shutdowns; \n \u2022 the general level of business and economic activity; and \n \u2022 the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation. \nSignificant volatility in raw material costs tends to put pressure on product margins as sales price increases could lag behind raw material cost increases. Conversely, when raw material costs decrease, customers may seek immediate relief in the form of lower sales prices. We currently use derivative instruments to reduce price volatility risk on feedstock commodities and lower overall costs. Normally, there is a pricing relationship between a commodity that we process and the feedstock from which it is derived. When this pricing relationship deviates from historical norms, we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments and physical positions in an attempt to take advantage of this relationship.\nOur historical results have been significantly affected by our plant production capacity, our efficient use of that capacity and our ability to increase capacity. Since our inception, we have followed a disciplined growth strategy that focuses on plant acquisitions, new plant construction and internal expansion. We evaluate each expansion project on the basis of its ability to produce sustained returns in excess of our cost of capital and its ability to improve efficiency or reduce operating costs. We also regularly look at acquisition opportunities that would be consistent with, or complimentary to, our overall business strategies. Depending on the size of the acquisition, any such acquisitions could require external financing.\nAs noted above in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" we are subject to extensive environmental regulations, which may impose significant additional costs on our operations in the future. Further, concerns about GHG emissions and their possible effects on climate change has led to the enactment of regulations, and to proposed legislation and additional regulations, that could affect us in the form of increased cost of feedstocks and fuel, other increased costs of production and decreased demand for our products. While we do not expect any of these enactments or proposals to have a material adverse effect on us in the near term, we cannot predict the longer-term effect of any of these regulations or proposals on our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe body of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States is commonly referred to as \"GAAP.\" For this purpose, a non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined by the SEC as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable GAAP measures. In this report, we disclose non-GAAP financial measures, primarily earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"). EBITDA is calculated as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The non-GAAP financial measures described in this Form 10-K are not substitutes for the GAAP measures of earnings and cash flows.\nEBITDA is included in this Form 10-K because our management considers it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry, some of which present EBITDA when reporting their results. We regularly evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and/or tax rates by using EBITDA. In addition, we utilize EBITDA in evaluating acquisition targets. Management also believes that EBITDA is a useful tool for measuring our ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements, and EBITDA is commonly used by us and our investors to measure our ability to service indebtedness. EBITDA is not a substitute for the GAAP measures of earnings or of cash flows and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. In addition, it should be noted that companies calculate EBITDA differently and, therefore, EBITDA as presented for us may not be comparable to EBITDA reported by other companies. EBITDA has material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and income taxes.\nRecent Developments\nOn January 2, 2019, we completed the acquisition of NAKAN, a global compounding solutions business, for approximately $250 million. NAKAN's products are used in a wide-variety of applications, including in the automotive, building and construction, and medical industries.\nOn October 4, 2018, Westlake Chemical Partners LP (\"Westlake Partners\") and Westlake Chemical Partners GP LLC, the general partner of Westlake Partners, entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the \"ATM Agreement\") with UBS Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (collectively, the \"Managers\"). Pursuant to the terms of the ATM Agreement, Westlake Partners may offer and sell common units representing limited partner interests in Westlake Partners from time to time to, or through, the Managers, as Westlake Partners' sales agents or as principals, having an aggregate offering amount of up to $50 million. Westlake Partners intends to use the net proceeds of sales of the common units for general partnership purposes, including the funding of potential future drop-downs and other acquisitions.\nOn August 17, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase an additional $150 million of shares of our common stock under our 2014 share repurchase program. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Liquidity and Financing Arrangements\" below for further discussions.\nWe have an 81.7% limited partner interest in Westlake Chemical OpCo LP (\"OpCo\"), a 43.8% limited partner interest in Westlake Partners, a general partner interest in Westlake Partners and incentive distribution rights (\"IDRs\"). On July 27, 2018, the Westlake Partners' partnership agreement was amended to revise the minimum quarterly distribution thresholds for Westlake Partners' IDRs. For more information on the amendment, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOn July 24, 2018, we entered into a new $1 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to mature on July 24, 2023. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt-Credit Agreement\" for more information.\nOn May 15, 2018, we redeemed all of the outstanding Westlake 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023 ($434 million aggregate principal amount) and all of the outstanding Axiall Corporation 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023 ($16 million aggregate principal amount) (collectively, the \"2023 Notes\") at a redemption price equal to 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2023 Notes to the redemption date.\nOn February 15, 2018, we redeemed all of the outstanding Westlake 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 ($625 million aggregate principal amount) and all of the outstanding Eagle Spinco Inc. 4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 ($63 million aggregate principal amount) (collectively, the \"2021 Notes\") at a redemption price equal to 102.313% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2021 Notes to the redemption date.\nResults of Operations\nSegment Data\n\n\n\n______________________________\n (1) Industry pricing data was obtained through IHS Markit (\"IHS\"). We have not independently verified the data. \n (2) Represents average North American spot prices of ethylene over the period as reported by IHS. \n (3) Represents average North American net transaction prices of polyethylene low density GP-Film grade over the period as reported by IHS. \n (4) Represents average North American contract prices of styrene over the period as reported by IHS. \n (5) Represents average North American United States Gulf Coast undiscounted contract prices of caustic soda over the period as reported by IHS. During the first quarter of 2018, IHS discontinued the previous caustic soda index that we used. For comparability, the average 2017 caustic soda is based on the current index. \n (6) Represents average North American contract prices of chlorine (into chemicals) over the period as reported by IHS. \n (7) Represents average North American contract prices of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) over the period as reported by IHS. Effective January 1, 2017, IHS made a non-market downward adjustment of 15 cents per pound to PVC prices. For comparability, we adjusted each prior-year period's PVC price downward by 15 cents per pound consistent with the IHS non-market adjustment.  Summary\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation was $996 million, or $7.62 per diluted share, on net sales of $8,635 million. This represents a decrease in net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation of $308 million, or $2.38 per diluted share, compared to 2017 net income attributable to Westlake Chemical Corporation of $1,304 million, or $10.00 per diluted share, on net sales of $8,041 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased versus the prior year primarily due to the recognition of a $591 million income tax benefit in 2017 under U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") and higher ethane feedstock costs. These decreases were partially offset by (1) higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda; (2) a lower effective income tax rate resulting from the reduced U.S. corporate income tax rate under the Tax Act; (3) lower purchased ethylene costs; (4) higher other income, including a one-time pension settlement gain of $14 million, and higher interest income; and (5) a lower interest expense due to lower average debt outstanding for 2018 as compared to 2017. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $594 million to $8,635 million compared to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $8,041 million, mainly due to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda and higher sales volumes for PVC resin and polyethylene, partially offset by lower polyethylene sales prices and lower styrene sales volumes. Income from operations was $1,408 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1,225 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $183 million. The increase in income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was mainly a result of higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda and improved operating rates in the Vinyls segment due to fewer planned turnarounds and unplanned outages, partially offset by higher ethane feedstock costs, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Pre-tax transaction and integration-related costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $33 million, or $0.19 per diluted share after tax, as compared to $29 million in 2017.\n2018 Compared with 2017\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $594 million, or 7%, to $8,635 million in 2018 from $8,041 million in 2017, primarily attributable to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda and higher sales volumes for PVC resin and polyethylene, partially offset by lower polyethylene sales prices and lower styrene sales volumes. Average sales prices for 2018 increased by 5% as compared to 2017. Overall sales volumes increased by 3% in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nGross Profit. Gross profit margin percentage increased to 23% in 2018 from 22% in 2017. The gross profit margin for 2018 was higher primarily due to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda, lower purchased ethylene costs and improved operating rates in the Vinyls segment due to fewer planned turnarounds and unplanned outages, partially offset by higher ethane feedstock costs, as compared to 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $46 million to $445 million in 2018 from $399 million in 2017. This increase was mainly due to an increase in employee compensation and professional consulting fees.\nAmortization of Intangibles. Amortization expense for 2018 was comparable to 2017.\nTransaction and Integration-related Costs. Transaction and integration-related costs were $33 million in 2018 as compared to $29 million in 2017. The transaction and integration-related costs primarily consisted of integration-related consulting fees, severance benefits provided in conjunction with acquisition and reorganization charges.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $33 million to $126 million in 2018 from $159 million in 2017, primarily as a result of lower average debt outstanding for 2018 as compared to 2017. The lower average debt balance in 2018 was mainly due to the redemption of the 2023 Notes in May 2018 and the 2021 Notes in February 2018. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt\" below for further discussion of our indebtedness.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net increased by $37 million to $52 million in 2018 from $15 million in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a one-time pension settlement gain of $14 million, an increase in interest income of $13 million, a net gain of $6 million recognized on the redemption of the 2021 Notes and an increase in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries of $6 million.\nIncome Taxes. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 22% in 2018 as compared to a benefit of 24% in 2017. The effective tax rate in 2018 was higher as compared to 2017, primarily due to the recognition of a $591 million income tax benefit in 2017 as a result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, the U.S. corporate income tax rate was lower in 2018 as compared to 2017. The effective income tax rate in 2018 was above the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to state and foreign taxes.\nOlefins Segment\nNet Sales. Net sales decreased by $32 million, or 2%, to $2,019 million in 2018 from $2,051 million in 2017. The decrease was mainly due to lower sales volumes for styrene as a result of a planned turnaround in the second quarter of 2018 and lower polyethylene sales prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes for polyethylene and higher sales prices for styrene, as compared to 2017. Average sales prices for the Olefins segment decreased by 1% in 2018 as compared to 2017, while average sales volumes in 2018 were consistent with 2017.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations was $573 million in 2018 as compared to $655 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower margins resulting from higher ethane feedstock costs and lower polyethylene sales prices, partially offset by higher polyethylene sales volumes.\nVinyls Segment\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $626 million, or 10%, to $6,616 million in 2018 from $5,990 million in 2017. This increase was mainly attributable to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda and higher sales volumes for PVC resin as compared to 2017. Average sales volumes increased by 4% in 2018, as compared to 2017, and average sales prices increased by 7% in 2018 as compared to 2017.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations was $913 million in 2018 as compared to $639 million in 2017. This increase was mainly attributable to higher sales prices and volumes for caustic soda, lower purchased ethylene costs, improved operating rates and lower costs associated with planned turnarounds and unplanned outages, as compared to 2017.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $2,965 million, or 58%, to $8,041 million in 2017 from $5,076 million in 2016, primarily attributable to higher sales volume contributed by Axiall and higher sales prices for our major products. Overall sales volumes increased by 46% in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily attributable to higher sales contributed by Axiall. Average sales prices for 2017 increased by 12% as compared to 2016.\nGross Profit. Gross profit margin percentage increased to 22% in 2017 from 19% in 2016. The gross profit margin for 2017 was higher primarily due to higher sales prices for our major products and higher sales volumes for caustic soda, chlorine and PVC resin contributed primarily by Axiall, as compared to 2016. These increases were offset by higher unabsorbed fixed manufacturing and other costs associated with turnarounds and unplanned outages and a proportionately larger sales volume for the Vinyls segment, for which industry margins in 2017 and 2016 were lower as compared to the Olefins industry.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $141 million, or 55%, in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily because a full year of Axiall's expenses were included in 2017, as compared to only four months in 2016 and an increase in employee compensation.\nAmortization of Intangibles. Amortization of intangibles are comprised of amortization expense for customer relationships, trade name and other intangible assets. The amortization expense increased by $70 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, because a full year of expense related to the intangible assets acquired in the Axiall Merger was included in 2017, as compared to only four months in 2016.\nTransaction and Integration-related Costs. Transaction and integration-related costs were $29 million in 2017 as compared to $104 million in 2016. Transaction and integration-related costs were $75 million lower in 2017 as compared to 2016 predominantly because significant transaction and integration-related costs were incurred at the time of the Axiall Merger in 2016. The transaction and integration-related costs in 2017 primarily consisted of severance benefits provided to former Axiall employees in conjunction with the Axiall Merger and integration costs and consulting fees related to the Axiall Merger. The transaction and integration-related costs in 2016 primarily consisted of severance benefits provided to former Axiall executives in conjunction with the Axiall Merger, including the conversion of Axiall restricted stock units into our restricted stock units, transitional service expenses for certain former Axiall employees, retention agreement costs and consulting and professional fees related to the Axiall Merger.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased by $80 million to $159 million in 2017 from $79 million in 2016, primarily as a result of higher average debt outstanding for the year as well as decreased capitalized interest on major capital projects in 2017 as compared to 2016. The debt balance increased in August 2016 to finance the Axiall Merger. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt\" below for further discussion of our indebtedness.\nOther Income, Net. Other income, net decreased by $39 million to $15 million in 2017 from $54 million in 2016. The decrease was mainly attributable to the realized gain in 2016 of $49 million from the previously held common stock of Axiall.\nIncome Taxes. The effective income tax rate was a benefit of 24% in 2017 as compared to an expense of 25% in 2016. The effective income tax rate for 2017 was below the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the $591 million income tax benefit as a result of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, partially offset by a one-time U.S. tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of our post-1986 foreign earnings as part of the Tax Act, the domestic manufacturing deduction, depletion deductions, income attributable to noncontrolling interests, foreign earnings rate differential and foreign withholding tax related to such earnings. The effective income tax rate for 2016 was below the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the benefit of state tax credits, the domestic manufacturing deduction, depletion deductions, income attributable to noncontrolling interests, the non-recognition of tax related to the gain recognized on previously held outstanding shares of common stock of Axiall, the benefit in prior years' and current-year tax credits for increased research and development expenditures and adjustments related to prior years' tax returns as filed, change in state apportionment and the foreign earnings rate differential, partially offset by state income taxes and nondeductible transaction costs related to the Axiall Merger.\nOlefins Segment\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $157 million, or 8%, to $2,051 million in 2017 from $1,894 million in 2016, mainly due to higher sales prices for our major products compared to the prior year. Average sales prices for the Olefins segment increased by 9% in 2017 as compared to 2016, while average sales volumes decreased by 1% in 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily due to lower polyethylene sales.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations was $655 million in 2017 as compared to $558 million in 2016. This increase was mainly attributable to higher olefins integrated product margins, primarily due to higher sales prices for our major products, higher operating rates and lower costs associated with turnarounds and unplanned outages as compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by higher energy costs. Income from operations for 2016 was negatively impacted by the planned turnaround and expansion of the Lake Charles Petro 1 ethylene unit along with other unplanned outages. Trading activity for 2017 resulted in a loss of $4 million as compared to a gain of $20 million for 2016.\nVinyls Segment\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $2,808 million, or 88%, to $5,990 million in 2017 from $3,182 million in 2016. This increase was mainly attributable to higher sales volume contributed primarily by Axiall and higher sales prices for our major products. Average sales volumes increased by 74% in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily because a full year of Axiall's operations was included in 2017 as compared to only four months of Axiall's operations included in 2016. Average sales prices for the Vinyls segment increased by 14% in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations was $639 million in 2017 as compared to $176 million in 2016. This increase was mainly attributable to earnings contributed by Axiall and higher sales prices and volumes for our major products. These increases were partially offset by higher unabsorbed fixed manufacturing and other costs associated with the planned turnaround and expansion at the Calvert City facility and other turnarounds and unplanned outages in addition to higher energy costs in 2017, as compared to 2016.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities provided cash of $1,409 million in 2018 compared to cash provided of $1,528 million in 2017. The $119 million decrease in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in working capital requirements, partially offset by an increase in income from operations in 2018 and lower income taxes for 2018 as a result of the Tax Act, as compared to 2017. Income from operations increased by $183 million in 2018, as compared to the prior year 2017. The increase in income from operations was primarily a result of higher sales price and volume for caustic soda partially offset by higher feedstock costs. Changes in components of working capital, which we define for purposes of this cash flow discussion as accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, less accounts payable and accrued liabilities, used cash of $290 million in 2018, compared to $155 million of cash provided in 2017, an unfavorable change of $445 million. The change was mainly driven by unfavorable changes in inventories, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Unfavorable changes in inventories were primarily the result of higher feedstock costs in 2018, as compared to 2017, and the changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were primarily due to the timing of purchases and payments to suppliers as well as due to a lower income tax accrual as a result of the lower tax rate under the Tax Act.\nOperating activities provided cash of $1,528 million in 2017 compared to cash provided of $867 million in 2016. The $661 million increase in cash flows from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in income from operations and a decrease in working capital requirements. Income from operations increased by $642 million in 2017, as compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of higher sales prices, resulting in a higher margin, as well as higher earnings contributed by Axiall. Changes in components of working capital, which we define for purposes of this cash flow discussion as accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, less accounts payable and accrued liabilities provided cash of $155 million in 2017, compared to $59 million of cash provided in 2016, a favorable change of $96 million. The favorable change was mainly due to a decrease in cash usage in 2017 of $141 million resulting from higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by higher accounts receivable, resulting in an increase in cash usage of $90 million, as compared to 2016.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities during 2018 was $754 million as compared to net cash used of $652 million in 2017. Capital expenditures were $702 million in 2018 compared to $577 million in 2017. Capital expenditures in 2018 were primarily related to expansion projects as well as projects to improve production capacity or reduce costs, maintenance and safety and environmental projects at our various facilities. The expansion projects include our previously announced ongoing expansions of chlor-alkali, PVC and VCM capacities at our plants in Germany and Geismar. Capital expenditures in 2017 were primarily incurred on the upgrade and expansion of OpCo's Calvert City ethylene plant at our Calvert City site. The remaining capital expenditures in 2017 primarily related to projects to improve production capacity or reduce costs, maintenance and safety and environmental projects at our various facilities. We spent $58 million in 2018 to fund the construction costs of our LACC joint venture, as compared to $66 million in 2017. In addition, we invested $10 million in other unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2018. Please see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Liquidity and Financing Arrangements\" below for further discussion.\nNet cash used for investing activities during 2017 was $652 million as compared to net cash used of $2,563 million in 2016. We used $2,438 million of cash, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Axiall in 2016. Capital expenditures were $577 million in 2017 compared to $629 million in 2016. Capital expenditures in 2017 were incurred on several projects, including the upgrade and expansion of OpCo's Calvert City ethylene plant at our Calvert City site. Capital expenditures in 2016 were primarily incurred on the upgrade and expansion of OpCo's Petro 1 ethylene unit at our Lake Charles site. The remaining capital expenditures in 2017 and 2016 primarily related to projects to improve production capacity or reduce costs, maintenance and safety and environmental projects at our various facilities. In addition, we spent $66 million in 2017 related to our contribution to LACC to fund the construction costs of the ethylene plant, as compared to $17 million in 2016. Please see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Liquidity and Financing Arrangements\" below for further discussion. We did not purchase any securities in 2017 compared to a total of $138 million of securities purchased in 2016. Other 2016 investing activity was related to the receipt of proceeds of $663 million from the sales and maturities of our investments.\nCash provided by operating and investing activities in 2017 and 2016 was retrospectively adjusted as a result of the adoption of accounting standards update No. 2016-18 effective January 1, 2018. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used by financing activities during 2018 was $1,427 million as compared to net cash provided of $6 million in 2017. We used $1,179 million for the repayment of notes payable, of which $704 million was used for the redemption of the 2021 Notes in February 2018 and $461 million was used for the redemption of the 2023 Notes in May 2018 and the remaining balance was used for the repayment of short-term notes payable. The remaining activities in 2018 were primarily related to the $120 million payment of cash dividends, the $45 million payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests, treasury stock repurchases of $106 million and proceeds of $14 million from the issuance of short-term notes payable. The 2017 activity was mainly related to the issuance of notes, drawdown under the Credit Agreement and issuance of Westlake Partners common units, partially offset by repayment of borrowings under the Credit Agreement, the payment of cash dividends, the payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests and the payment of debt issuance costs.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during 2017 was $6 million as compared to net cash provided of $1,687 million in 2016. We received net proceeds in 2017 of $978 million from notes payable and drawdown of revolver which comprised of (1) $495 million from the issuance in November 2017 of the 4.375% Senior Notes due 2047; (2) $250 million from the remarketing in November 2017 of the Refunding Bonds; (3) $225 million from a drawdown under the Credit Agreement; and (4) $8 million issuance of notes payable. Additionally, we received $111 million from the issuance of Westlake Partners common units as a result of its secondary offering in September 2017. In 2017, we used cash of (1) $150 million for the repayment of our prior term loan; (2) $250 million for the redemption of the 6 \u00be% tax exempt revenue bonds due November 2032; and (3) $550 million for the repayment of borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The remaining 2017 activity was primarily related to the $103 million payment of cash dividends, the $28 million payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests, the $6 million payment of debt issuance costs and activities related to Huasu's short-term notes payable to banks in connection with payments of suppliers through letters of credit. The 2016 activity was mainly related to the issuance of senior notes and our prior term loan and borrowings under the Credit Agreement, partially offset by repayment of borrowings under the Credit Agreement, the payment of cash dividends, the payment of cash distributions to noncontrolling interests, the payment of debt issuance costs and the repurchase of shares of our common stock.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity and Financing Arrangements\nOur principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents, cash from operations, short-term borrowings under the Credit Agreement and our long-term financing.\nOn January 2, 2019, we acquired NAKAN and paid approximately $250 million as the purchase price.\nOn July 24, 2018, we entered into a new $1 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to mature on July 24, 2023. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt-Credit Agreement\" for more information.\nIn November 2014, our Board of Directors authorized a $250 million stock repurchase program (the \"2014 Program\"). In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved the expansion of the 2014 Program by an additional $150 million. In August 2018, our Board of Directors approved the further expansion of the existing 2014 Program by an additional $150 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had repurchased 5,562,479 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $335 million under the 2014 Program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 1,368,881 shares of our common stock were repurchased under the 2014 Program. Purchases under the 2014 Program may be made either through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Decisions regarding the amount and the timing of purchases under the 2014 Program will be influenced by our cash on hand, our cash flow from operations, general market conditions and other factors. The 2014 Program may be discontinued by our Board of Directors at any time.\nWe are party to a joint venture with Lotte Chemical USA Corporation to build an ethylene facility, LACC. The ethylene facility is located adjacent to our vinyls facility in Lake Charles. Pursuant to the contribution and subscription agreement, we agreed to make a maximum capital commitment to LACC of up to $225 million to fund the construction costs of the ethylene plant, which represents approximately 10% of the interests in LACC. The construction of the ethylene plant commenced in January 2016, with an anticipated start-up in the first half of 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had funded approximately $183 million of our portion of the construction costs of the ethylene plant.\nOn February 15 and May 15, 2018, we redeemed all of the 2021 Notes ($688 million aggregate principal amount) and all of the 2023 Notes ($450 million aggregate principal amount), respectively.\nWe believe that our sources of liquidity as described above are adequate to fund our normal operations and ongoing capital expenditures. Funding of any potential large expansions or potential acquisitions would likely necessitate and therefore depend on our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. We may not be able to access additional liquidity at cost effective interest rates due to the volatility of the commercial credit markets.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of December 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $753 million. In addition, we have the Credit Agreement available to supplement cash if needed, as described under \"Debt\" below.\nDebt\nAs of December 31, 2018, our indebtedness, including the current portion, totaled $2,668 million. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our long-term indebtedness. Defined terms used in this section have the definitions assigned to such terms in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Based on our current level of operations and unless we were to undertake a new expansion or large acquisition, we believe our cash flows from operations, available cash and available borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be adequate to meet our normal operating needs for the foreseeable future.\nCredit Agreement\nOn July 24, 2018, we entered into a new $1 billion revolving credit facility that is scheduled to mature on July 24, 2023 (the \"Credit Agreement\") and, in connection therewith, terminated the existing $1 billion revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on August 23, 2021 (the \"Prior Credit Agreement\"). The Credit Agreement bears interest at either (a) LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 1.00% to 1.75% or (b) Alternate Base Rate plus a spread ranging from 0.00% to 0.75% in each case depending on the credit rating of the Company. At December 31, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $4 million and borrowing availability of $996 million under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including a quarterly total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the total leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains certain events of default and if and for so long as certain events of default have occurred and are continuing, any overdue amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will accrue interest at an increased rate, the lenders can terminate their commitments thereunder and payments of any outstanding amounts could be accelerated by the lenders. None of our subsidiaries are required to guarantee our obligations under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement includes a $150 million sub-limit for letters of credit, and any outstanding letters of credit will be deducted from availability under the facility. The Credit Agreement also provides for a discretionary $50 million commitment for swingline loans to be provided on a same-day basis. We may also increase the size of the facility, in increments of at least $25 million, up to a maximum of $500 million, subject to certain conditions and if certain lenders agree to commit to such an increase.\nIn connection with our entry into the Credit Agreement and termination of the Prior Credit Agreement on July 24, 2018, all guarantees by our subsidiaries of our payment obligations under the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes, the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes, the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes were released.\nGO Zone Bonds and IKE Zone Bonds\nIn November 2017, the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facility and Development Authority (the \"Authority\") completed the offering of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% tax-exempt revenue refunding bonds due November 1, 2032 (the \"Refunding Bonds\"), the net proceeds of which were used to redeem $250 million aggregate principal amount of the Authority's 6 \u00be% tax-exempt revenue bonds due November 1, 2032 issued by the Authority under the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 (the \"GO Zone Act\") in December 2007. In connection with the issuance of the Refunding Bonds, we issued $250 million of the 3.5% 2032 GO Zone Refunding Senior Notes. The Refunding Bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company at any time on or after November 1, 2027, for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest.\nIn July 2010, the Authority completed the reoffering of $100 million of the 6 \u00bd% 2029 GO Zone Bonds. In connection with the reoffering of the 6 \u00bd% 2029 GO Zone Bonds, we issued $100 million of the 6 \u00bd% 2029 GO Zone Senior Notes. In December 2010, the Authority issued $89 million of the 6 \u00bd% 2035 GO Zone Bonds. In connection with the issuance of the 6 \u00bd% 2035 GO Zone Bonds, we issued $89 million of the 6 \u00bd% 2035 GO Zone Senior Notes. In December 2010, the Authority completed the offering of $65 million of the 6 \u00bd% 2035 IKE Zone Bonds under Section 704 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the \"IKE Zone Act\"). In connection with the issuance of the 6 \u00bd% 2035 IKE Zone Bonds, we issued $65 million of the 6 \u00bd% 2035 IKE Zone Senior Notes.\nThe 6 \u00bd% 2029 GO Zone Bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company at any time prior to August 1, 2020 for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted \"make whole\" payment. On or after August 1, 2020, the 6 \u00bd% 2029 GO Zone Bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest. The 6 \u00bd% 2035 GO Zone Bonds and the 6 \u00bd% 2035 IKE Zone Bonds are subject to optional redemption by the Authority upon the direction of the Company at any time prior to November 1, 2020 for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted \"make whole\" payment.

See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information.\n3.60% Senior Notes due 2026 and 5.0% Senior Notes due 2046\nIn August 2016, we completed the private offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and $700 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes. In March 2017, the Company commenced registered exchange offers to exchange the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes for new notes that are identical in all material respects to the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes, except that the offer and issuance of the new Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\")-registered notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). The exchange offers expired on April 24, 2017, and approximately 99.97% of the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes and 100% of the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes were exchanged. The notes that were not exchanged in the exchange offers have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the U.S. absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements or a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities law.\n3.60% Senior Notes due 2022\nIn July 2012, we issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes. We may optionally redeem the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes at any time and from time to time prior to April 15, 2022 (three months prior to the maturity date) for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted \"make whole\" payment. On or after April 15, 2022, we may optionally redeem the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest. The holders of the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes may require us to repurchase the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, upon the occurrence of both a \"change of control\" and, within 60 days of such change of control, a \"below investment grade rating event\" (as such terms are defined in the indenture governing the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes).\n4.375% Senior Notes due 2047\nIn November 2017, we completed the registered public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% Senior Notes due November 15, 2047. We may optionally redeem the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes at any time and from time to time prior to May 15, 2047 (six months prior to the maturity date) for 100% of the principal plus accrued interest and a discounted \"make whole\" payment. On or after May 15, 2047, we may optionally redeem the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes for 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The holders of the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes may require us to repurchase the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes at a price of 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase, upon the occurrence of both a \"change of control\" and, within 60 days of such change of control, a \"below investment grade rating event\" (as such terms are defined in the indenture governing the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes). See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\n4.625% Senior Notes due 2021 and 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023\nIn September 2016, we completed offers to exchange (the \"Axiall Exchange Offers\") any and all of the $688 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes and the $450 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% Subsidiary 2023 Senior Notes (together with the 4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes, the \"Subsidiary Notes\") issued by Axiall for new senior notes issued by us having the same maturity and interest rates as the Subsidiary Notes. Pursuant to the Axiall Exchange Offers, $625 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes and $434 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes were exchanged for an identical amount of 4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes and 4.875% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes, respectively, leaving outstanding $63 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes and $16 million aggregate amount of 4.875% Subsidiary 2021 Notes. In December 2017, we delivered notices for the optional redemption of all of the outstanding 4.625% Westlake 2021 Senior Notes and 4.625% Subsidiary 2021 Senior Notes (collectively, the \"2021 Notes\"). The 2021 Notes were redeemed on February 15, 2018 at a redemption price equal to 102.313% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2021 Notes to the redemption date. In March 2018, we delivered notices for the optional redemption of all of the outstanding Westlake 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023 and 4.875% Subsidiary Notes due 2023 (collectively, the \"2023 Notes\"). The 2023 Notes were redeemed on May 15, 2018 at a redemption price equal to 102.438% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on the 2023 Notes to the redemption date.\nRevenue Bonds\nIn December 1997, we entered into a loan agreement with a public trust established for public purposes for the benefit of the Parish of Calcasieu, Louisiana. The public trust issued $11 million principal amount of tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds in order to finance our construction of waste disposal facilities for an ethylene plant. The waste disposal revenue bonds expire in December 2027 and are subject to redemption and mandatory tender for purchase prior to maturity under certain conditions. Interest on the waste disposal revenue bonds accrues at a rate determined by a remarketing agent and is payable quarterly. The interest rate on the waste disposal revenue bonds at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 1.85% and 1.73%, respectively.\nThe indenture governing the 3.60% 2026 Senior Notes, the 5.0% 2046 Senior Notes, the 3.60% 2022 Senior Notes and the 4.375% 2047 Senior Notes contains customary events of default and covenants that will restrict us and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to (1) incur certain secured indebtedness, (2) engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions and (3) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our long-term debt covenants.\nWestlake Chemical Partners LP Credit Arrangements\nOur subsidiary, Westlake Chemical Finance Corporation, is the lender party to a $600 million revolving credit facility with Westlake Chemical Partners LP (\"Westlake Partners\"), originally entered into on April 29, 2015. The revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature on April 29, 2021. Borrowings under the revolver bear interest at LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 2.0% to 3.0% (depending on Westlake Partners' consolidated leverage ratio), payable quarterly. Westlake Partners may pay all or a portion of the interest on any borrowings in kind, in which case any such amounts would be added to the principal amount of the loan. As of December 31, 2018, outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled $254 million and bore interest at the LIBOR rate plus 2.0%.\nOur subsidiary, Westlake Polymers LLP, is the administrative agent to a $600 million revolving credit facility with OpCo. The revolving credit facility was amended on September 25, 2018 to extend the maturity date from August 2019 to September 2023 and to revise the applicable margin from 3.0% to 2.0%. As of December 31, 2018, outstanding borrowings under the credit facility totaled $224 million and bore interest at the LIBOR rate plus 2.0%, which is accrued in arrears quarterly.\nWe consolidate Westlake Partners and OpCo for financial reporting purposes as we have a controlling financial interest. As such, the revolving credit facilities described above between our subsidiaries and Westlake Partners and OpCo are eliminated upon consolidation.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nIn addition to long-term debt, we are required to make payments relating to various types of obligations. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 relating to long-term debt, operating leases, capital leases, pension benefits funding, post-retirement healthcare benefits, purchase obligations and interest payments for the next five years and thereafter. The amounts do not include deferred charges and other items classified in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet due to the uncertainty of the future payment schedule.\n\nPension Benefits Funding. This represents the projected timing of contributions to our defined benefit pension plans which cover certain eligible employees in the United States and non-U.S. countries.\nPost-retirement Healthcare Benefits. This represents the projected timing of contributions to our post-retirement healthcare benefits to the employees of certain subsidiaries who meet certain minimum age and service requirements.\nPurchase Obligations. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including a minimum quantity and price. We are party to various obligations to purchase goods and services, including commitments to purchase various feedstock, utilities, nitrogen, oxygen, product storage, pipeline usage and logistic support, in each case in the ordinary course of our business, as well as various purchase commitments for our capital projects. The amounts shown in the table above reflect our estimates based on the contractual quantities and the prices in effect under contractual agreements as of December 31, 2018.\nInterest Payments. Interest payments are based on interest rates in effect at December 31, 2018.\nAsset retirement obligations. This includes the estimated costs and timing of payments to satisfy our recognized asset retirement obligations.\nInvestment in LACC. This includes our portion of the forecasted capital contributions related to the engineering, procurement and construction of LACC's new ethylene plant.\nStandby Letters of Credit. This includes (1) our obligation under an $11 million letter of credit issued in connection with the $11 million tax-exempt waste disposal revenue bonds and (2) other letters of credit totaling $26 million issued primarily to support commercial obligations and obligations under our insurance programs, including workers' compensation claims.\nUncertain income tax positions. We have recognized a liability for our uncertain income tax positions of approximately $12 million as of December 31, 2018. We do not believe we are likely to pay any material amounts during the year ending December 31, 2019. The ultimate resolution and timing of payment for remaining matters continues to be uncertain and are therefore excluded from the Contractual Obligations table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions. We have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes and believe those policies are reasonable and appropriate.\nWe apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with GAAP. Our more critical accounting policies include those related to long-lived assets, fair value estimates, accruals for long-term employee benefits, accounts receivable, income taxes and environmental and legal obligations. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates. We periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. We believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements.\nLong-Lived Assets. Key estimates related to long-lived assets include useful lives, recoverability of carrying values and existence of any retirement obligations. Such estimates could be significantly modified. The carrying values of long-lived assets could be impaired by significant changes or projected changes in supply and demand fundamentals (which would have a negative impact on operating rates or margins), new technological developments, new competitors with significant raw material or other cost advantages, adverse changes associated with the United States and world economies, the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with governmental actions.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including when negative conditions such as significant current or projected operating losses exist. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions and the operational performance of our businesses. Actual impairment losses incurred could vary significantly from amounts estimated. Long-lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Additionally, future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that associated long-lived assets of our businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe estimated useful lives of long-lived assets range from one to 40 years. Depreciation and amortization of these assets, including amortization of deferred turnaround costs, under the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives totaled $641 million, $601 million and $378 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated, depreciation or amortization charges would be accelerated.\nWe defer the costs of planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, and amortize the costs over the period until the next planned turnaround of the affected unit. Total costs deferred on turnarounds were $79 million, $47 million and $77 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amortization in 2018, 2017 and 2016 of previously deferred turnaround costs was $39 million, $30 million and $22 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, deferred turnaround costs, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $144 million. Expensing turnaround costs as incurred would likely result in greater variability of our quarterly operating results and would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nAdditional information concerning long-lived assets and related depreciation and amortization appears in Notes 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nFair Value Estimates. We develop estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire a business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, to assess impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and to record marketable securities, derivative instruments and pension plan assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the engagement of third-party consultants. At December 31, 2018, our recorded goodwill was $1,002 million, which was associated with the acquisition of Axiall, our specialty PVC pipe business and our Longview facilities. In addition, we record all derivative instruments, pension plan assets and certain marketable securities at fair value. The fair value of these items is determined by quoted market prices or from observable market-based inputs. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nBusiness Combinations and Intangible Assets Including Goodwill. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill. Any changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded for acquisitions prior to the finalization of more detailed analysis, but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Any subsequent changes to any purchase price allocations that are material to our consolidated financial results will be adjusted in the same period's financial statements, including the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and in-process research and development costs are recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter until completion, at which point the asset is amortized over its expected useful life. Separately recognized transactions associated with business combinations are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date. The application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced below its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment assessment for the Olefins and Vinyls reporting units in October and April, respectively. We may elect to perform an optional qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment analysis is required. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors related to raw materials and labor, current and projected financial performance, changes in management or strategy, and market capitalization. Alternatively, we may unconditionally elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in any period. We elected to perform the qualitative assessment for both of our segments' reporting units during 2018 and concluded that quantitative impairment test was not required.\nIf we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or conclude, based on the totality of events or circumstances, it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment analysis is performed. The quantitative analysis compares a reporting unit's fair value to its carrying amount to determine whether goodwill is impaired. The fair values of the reporting units are calculated using both a discounted cash flow methodology and a market value methodology. The discounted cash flow projections are based on a forecast to reflect the cyclicality of the business. The forecast is based on historical results and estimates by management, including its strategic and operational plans, and financial performance of the market. The future cash flows are discounted to present value using an applicable discount rate. The significant assumptions used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit using the market value methodology include the determination of appropriate market comparables and the estimated multiples of EBITDA a willing buyer is likely to pay. Even if the fair values of the reporting units decreased by 10% from the fair values determined in the most recent quantitative tests performed during 2017, the carrying values of the reporting units would not have exceeded their fair values. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-If our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other intangible assets become impaired in the future, we may be required to record non-cash charges to earnings, which could be significant.\"\nThe results of operations of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.\nLong-Term Employee Benefit Costs. Our costs for long-term employee benefits, particularly pension and postretirement medical and life benefits, are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods. The net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. It is our responsibility, often with the assistance of independent experts, to select assumptions that represent the best estimates of those uncertainties. It is also our responsibility to review those assumptions periodically and, if necessary, adjust the assumptions to reflect changes in economic or other factors.\nAccounting for employee retirement plans involves estimating the cost of benefits that are to be provided in the future and attempting to match, for each employee, that estimated cost to the period worked. To accomplish this, we rely extensively on advice from actuaries, and we make assumptions about inflation, investment returns, mortality, employee turnover and discount rates that ultimately impact amounts recorded. Changes in these assumptions may result in different expense and liability amounts. One of the more significant assumptions relates to the discount rate for measuring benefit obligations. At December 31, 2018, the projected pension benefit obligations for U.S. and non-U.S. plans were calculated using assumed weighted average discount rates of 4.1% and 2.0%, respectively. The discount rates were determined using a benchmark pension discount curve and applying spot rates from the curve to each year of expected benefit payments to determine the appropriate discount rate. As a result of the funding relief provided by the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, no minimum funding requirements are expected during 2019 for the U.S. pension plans. Additional information on the 2019 funding requirements and key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appear in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThe following table reflects the sensitivity of the benefit obligation of our pension plans to changes in the actuarial assumptions:\n\nA one-percentage point increase or decrease in assumed healthcare trend rates would not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans.\nWhile we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K related to these retirement plans are based on the best estimates and judgments available, the actual outcomes could differ from these estimates.\nIncome Taxes. We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded based upon temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period. Valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nEnvironmental and Legal Obligations. We consult with various professionals to assist us in making estimates relating to environmental costs and legal proceedings. We accrue an expense when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. While we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to these contingencies are based on the best estimates and judgments available, the actual outcomes could differ from our estimates. Additional information about certain legal proceedings and environmental matters appears in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. We recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Initially, the asset retirement obligation is recorded at fair value and capitalized as a component of the carrying value of the long-lived asset to which the obligation relates. The liability is recorded at its future value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, a gain or loss is recorded. We have conditional asset retirement obligations for the removal and disposal of hazardous materials from certain of our manufacturing facilities.\nWe also have conditional asset retirement obligations that have not been recognized because the fair values of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured due to the indeterminate settlement date of the obligations. Settlements of the unrecognized conditional asset retirement obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any individual reporting period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting

"The summary of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the report MD&A: Item 7 includes the following key points:\n\n1. Company Overview:\n   - The company is a global manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals, polymers, and building products, with Olefins and Vinyls as its two principal operating segments.\n   - A significant portion of the internally-produced basic chemicals is used for higher value-added chemical products and building products.\n\n2. Market and Industry Conditions:\n   - The petrochemical industry is cyclical with margins affected by supply-demand balance, economic activity, and raw material prices.\n   - Ethane-based ethylene producers have had cost advantages in some periods, leading to a strong export market which benefited the company's Olefins segment.\n\n3. Financial Performance and Changes:\n   - There was a significant reduction in profitability due to increased global supply and feedstock costs.\n   - The Vinyls segment has improved its operating margins and cash flows, largely due to competitive feedstock and energy costs in the U.S.\n   - The acquisition of Axiall Corporation made the company the third-largest chlor-alkali and PVC producer in the world.\n\n4. Raw Material and Energy Supply:\n   - The company buys significant amounts of ethane feedstock, natural gas, ethylene, salt, and electricity, with prices subject to volatility. Derivative instruments are used to hedge price risk.\n\n5. Capital Utilization and Expansion:\n   - The company follows a disciplined growth strategy focusing on acquisitions, new construction, and internal expansions.\n   - Environmental regulations, as well as GHG emissions regulations, pose a risk of additional costs and reduced product demand in the future.\n\n6. Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\n   - EBITDA is utilized for evaluating performance, investment analysis, and debt servicing capabilities, but it has limitations as it excludes interest expense, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\n\n7. Recent Developments:\n   - The company completed the acquisition of NAKAN and entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with various financial institutions.\n   - The Board of Directors authorized additional share repurchase programs, and new credit facilities were established.\n   - There were redemptions of various senior notes.\n\n8. Results of Operations:\n   - Net external sales and income from operations have fluctuated over the past three years, with detailed tables providing segmented financial data and year-on-year changes.\n   - Certain costs and benefits, such as tax-related adjustments, have contributed to the changes in net income and net sales.\n\n9. Liquidity and Capital Resources:\n   - The company believes it has adequate liquidity to fund current operations and capital expenditures, but additional financing may be required for large expansions or acquisitions.\n   - A detailed table summarizes the company's contractual obligations and commercial commitments.\n\n10. Critical Accounting Policies:\n    - The company has critical accounting policies related to long-lived assets, fair value estimates, employee benefit accruals, accounts receivable, and income taxes.\n    - Adjustments to assumptions and estimates could affect the reported financial performance.\n\n11. Recent Accounting Pronouncements:\n    - The company provides information on recent accounting pronouncements, including adoption dates and potential impacts, incorporated by reference from Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements."}
