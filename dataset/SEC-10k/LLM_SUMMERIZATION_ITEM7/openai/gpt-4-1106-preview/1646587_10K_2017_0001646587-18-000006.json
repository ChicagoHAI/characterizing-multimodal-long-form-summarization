Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and risk factors in Part I. Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d of this report. References to NorthStar Europe,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d or our\u201d refer to NorthStar Realty Europe Corp. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise. References to our Manager\u201d refer to NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc., or NSAM, for the period prior to the Mergers (refer below) and Colony NorthStar, Inc., for the period subsequent to the Mergers. As part of the Mergers, NSAM changed its name to Colony NorthStar, Inc.\nSummary of Business\nOur primary business line is investing in European real estate. We are predominantly focused on prime office properties in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France.\nSources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flows\nWe primarily generate revenue from rental and other operating income from our properties and interest income from our preferred equity investment. Our income is primarily derived through the difference between the revenue and the operating and financing expenses of our investments. We may also continue to acquire investments that generate attractive returns without any leverage.\nProfitability and Performance Metrics\nWe calculate cash available for distribution, or CAD, and NOI, as metrics to evaluate the profitability and performance of our business (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a description of these metrics).\nOutlook and Recent Trends\nThe European economy grew at its fastest rate in a decade during 2017, with Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, growing by 2.5% in both the European Union, EU, and the Euro Area. The region's robust economic performance was underpinned by strong global economic growth driving European exports, fueling corporate profits and resulting in an increase in overall confidence and investment levels. Unemployment in the EU continued to fall, reaching 7.3% in December 2017, down from 8.2% a year earlier and the lowest level recorded since October 2008.\nIn February 2018, the European Commission, or EC, revised its 2018 GDP forecast for the Euro Area up by 0.2% to 2.3% citing continued strength in domestic demand and investment levels. The 2019 Euro Area outlook has also been revised upwards to 2.0%, 0.1% above the November forecast.\nThis stronger than anticipated economic growth resulted in the European Central Bank, or ECB, signaling its intention to begin tapering while citing that, any tightening of monetary policy is likely to be gradual and subject to ongoing review based on the future economic performance and inflation outlook of the region. On March 8, 2018, the ECB announced its decision to maintain interest rates at zero percent and confirmed its intention to continue with its asset purchase program of \u20ac30 billion per month through September 2018, and beyond if necessary. The ECB's expectations are that inflation, which stood at 1.3% in January 2018, will remain below its target of just under 2% through 2019.\nFollowing the Dutch, German and French elections last year, geopolitical uncertainty in the region appears to have receded. However, the prominence of certain Eurosceptic parties in the recent Italian parliamentary elections suggests that the risk of further geopolitical tremors in the region may not have completely disappeared.\nIn contrast with the overall European economy, the U.K. economy began to slow in 2017, posting 0.5% growth during the fourth quarter, and 1.8% for the full year 2017, as uncertainty associated with Brexit weighed on business sentiment and investment while elevated levels of inflation due to a weaker U.K. Pound Sterling eroded real incomes and began to dampen consumer demand. The EC forecasts the U.K. economy to grow by 1.4% and 1.1% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. On November 2, 2017 the Bank of England, or BOE, raised the U.K. base interest rate from 0.25% to 0.5%, the first interest rate rise in a decade, in an effort to contain inflation which stood at 3.1% in the year to December, well above the BOE's stated target of 2.0%. The BOE signaled that any further increases were likely to be at a gradual pace and limited in number. This cautious tone is reflective of the outlook for the U.K. economy which, despite its relatively resilient performance since the referendum, remains uncertain and likely to be dependent on the duration and perceived outcome of ongoing Brexit negotiations.\nEuropean commercial real estate investment volume totaled \u20ac89 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 and \u20ac291 billion in the full year 2017, 11% above its 2016 level. Office remained the most sought after asset class in Europe, representing approximately 40% of the total 2017 transaction volume. Prime property yields in most asset classes and markets were stable during the fourth quarter and continue to remain at a significant premium to sovereign yields.\nStrong office occupier demand (10% year on year growth in take up) coupled with modest supply across all major European markets continued to place downward pressure on vacancy throughout 2017, which during the fourth quarter decreased to their\nlowest levels since 2008. These robust occupational markets coupled with higher level of inflation continued to place upward pressure on rents.\nDriven by strong demand for office properties, which represented more than 50% of the total transaction volume during the year, German real estate investment reached \u20ac57.4 billion in 2017 (\u20ac18 billion in the fourth quarter), 9% above 2016 and the second highest level after 2007. Take up across the top 6 German cities increased by 11% year over year that coupled with constrained office supply created positive pressure on rents that rose 3.4% year over year in 2017.\nTotal U.K. investment volume reached \u00a316.4 billion in the fourth quarter and \u00a363.3 billion during 2017, a 20% increase on 2016 investment volume. Central London office investment volume totaled \u00a33.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, bringing the year-end total to \u00a316.4 billion, 26% higher than 2016 and the fourth highest annual total on record. Take-up in Central London was 15% ahead of 2016 with flexible workplace providers accounting for more than 21% of all leasing volumes in 2017.\nDriven by a number of large transactions completed during the fourth quarter, French investment volume was \u20ac12 billion in the fourth quarter 2017, 9% above the same period last year. Total 2017 investment volume was 27 billion, 5% below 2016 due in part to the ongoing shortage of high quality stock. The Paris occupational market remains robust with the Class A vacancy rate reaching a five year low in December 2017, and placing upward pressure on rents.\nOur Strategy\nWe seek to provide our stockholders with a stable and recurring cash flow for distribution supplemented by capital growth over time. Our business is predominantly focused on prime office properties located in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France. These are not only the largest economies in Europe, but the largest, most established, liquid and among the most stable office markets in Europe. We seek to utilize our established local networks to source suitable investment opportunities. We have a long term investment approach and expect to make equity investments, directly or indirectly through joint ventures.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor recent accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our business, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.

Rental income decreased $19.0 million, primarily due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016.\nEscalation Income\nEscalation income consists of tenant recoveries in our real estate equity segment. Escalation income decreased $3.5 million, primarily due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016 and the timing of certain recoverable expenses. There is a corresponding decrease in properties - operating expenses and a majority of these costs are recovered from our tenants.\nInterest Income\nInterest income relates to our preferred equity investment originated in the second quarter 2017 in our preferred equity segment.\nOther Income\nOther income is principally related to lease surrender premiums, insurance refunds and termination fees in our real estate equity segment. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2017 predominantly represents lease surrender premium payments. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2016 represents early termination of two tenants whose spaces were subsequently re-let.\nExpenses\nProperties - Operating Expenses\nProperties - operating expenses decreased $4.8 million due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016 partially offset by a straight-line rent write-off related to an early tenant termination at Portman Square in connection with the Invesco expansion. There is a corresponding decrease in escalation income and a majority of these costs are recovered from our tenants.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $15.6 million due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016 and corresponding repayments of certain mortgage notes and due to the refinancing of certain mortgage notes in our real estate equity segment in the third quarter 2017 and the repayment of our senior stock-settlable notes in our corporate segment in 2016.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily related to costs associated with amending the management agreement in our corporate segment and other acquisition costs in our preferred equity segment. In addition, a transaction fee was paid to a third party and reimbursed in total by the entity that originated our preferred equity investment resulting in no impact to transaction costs. Transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily related to costs associated with exploring potential transactions and the Mergers in our corporate segment.\nImpairment losses\nImpairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to impairment of one of our held-for-sale assets in our real estate equity segment, which sold in 2016 for less than the initial carrying value. The initial carrying value was based on the initial purchase price allocation of the asset, which utilized different assumptions than the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation, primarily being a longer holding period. The sale price of the asset was in line with the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation.\nManagement Fee, Related Party\nManagement fee, related party relates to the management fee incurred to our Manager in our corporate segment (refer to Related Parties Arrangements\u201d below for more information).\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses primarily represent third-party service provider fees such as asset management, accounting, tax, legal fees and other compliance related fees related to portfolio management of our real estate equity segment. The decrease of $3.1 million is due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016 partially offset by one time fees associated with the termination of certain third-party property accountants.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses including external and internal audit, legal fees and other corporate expenses are incurred in our corporate segment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Manager did not allocate any general and administrative expenses to us. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our Manager allocated $0.2 million.\nCompensation Expense\nCompensation expense is comprised of non-cash amortization of time-based, market-based and performance-based awards in our corporate segment. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017, is mainly due to the acceleration of a material portion of our time-based equity awards due to the Mergers which occurred in the first quarter of 2017. Refer to Note 7 Compensation Expense\u201d and Note 8 Stockholders' Equity\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further information.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016 in our real estate equity segment partially, offset by the write-off of intangibles due to lease terminations in the third quarter 2017.\nOther Income (Loss)\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Derivatives and Other\nUnrealized gain (loss) on derivatives and other is primarily related to the non-cash change in fair value of derivative instruments. The loss related to foreign currency forwards used to hedge projected net property level cash flows in our corporate segment was primarily due to the strengthened Euro against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in the loss related to the interest rate caps in our real estate equity segment is due to the movement in European interest rate in 2017 compared to 2016.\nThe following table presents a summary of unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives and other for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

Same store net operating income is presented for the same store portfolio, which represents all properties that were owned by us in the end of the reporting period. We define same store net operating income as NOI excluding (i) properties that were acquired or sold during the period, (ii) impact of foreign currency changes and (iii) amortization of above/below market leases. We consider same store net operating income to be an appropriate and useful supplemental performance measure. Same store net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, our methodology for calculating same store net operating income involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies. Refer below for a reconciliation of same store NOI to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Same Store Revenue\nSame store rental income increased driven primarily by recent leasing activity and rent reviews completed during the year including Deutsche Bundesbank commencing occupation in the Trianon Tower (completed in January 2018). Same store other income decreased due to one-time early termination premiums in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSame Store Expense\nSame store properties - operating expenses decreased due to lower repairs and maintenance partially offset by the timing of certain recoverable expenses and a straight-line rent write-off related to an early tenant termination at Portman Square in connection with the Invesco expansion.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Same Store\nThe following table presents a reconciliation from net income (loss) to same store net operating income for the real estate equity segment for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Same Store Reconciliation\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate segment net (income) loss(1)\n</td> <td>13,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) loss(2)\n</td> <td>8,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(430\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income\n</td> <td>24,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sale of real estate investments and other(3)\n</td> <td>(349\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,193\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income(4)\n</td> <td>(705\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store net operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes management fees, general and administrative expense, compensation expense, corporate interest expense and corporate transaction costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Includes depreciation and amortization expense, unrealized loss on interest rate caps, and other expenses in the real estate equity segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Represents the impact of assets sold during the period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>Represents interest income earned in the preferred equity segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(5)\n</td> <td>Three months ended December 31, 2016 is translated using the average exchange rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Escalation income\n</td> <td>25,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>1,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>151,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Properties -

Rental income increased $23.3 million, primarily due to 2016 being the first full year since acquisition and leases signed in 2016 partially offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016 and the vacancy of a tenant in the Trianon Tower in the fourth quarter 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 27,000 square meters of leases were signed and renegotiated in our real estate equity segment generating a revenue increase of $5 million.\nEscalation Income\nEscalation income consists of tenant recoveries in our real estate equity segment. Escalation income increased $6.4 million, primarily due to 2016 being the first full year since acquisition, leases signed in 2016 resulting in higher recoverability partially offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016. There is a corresponding increase in properties operating expenses and a majority of these costs are recoverable from the tenants.\nOther Income\nOther income is principally related to lease termination fees in our real estate equity segment. Other revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the early termination of two tenants whose spaces were subsequently re-let.\nExpenses\nProperties - Operating Expenses\nProperties - operating expenses increased $9.3 million due to 2016 being the first full year of since acquisition partially offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016. There is a corresponding increase in escalation income and a majority of these costs are recovered from our tenants.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $5.3 million due to 2016 being the first full year since acquisition and financing partially offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016 and the refinancing of certain mortgage notes in our real estate equity segment.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relate to costs associated with exploring potential transactions in our real estate equity segment and costs related to the Mergers in our corporate segment. Transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily represented expenses such as real estate transfer tax and professional fees related to the acquisitions in 2015 in our real estate equity segment and the Spin-off in our corporate segment.\nImpairment losses\nImpairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to impairment of one of our held-for-sale assets in our real estate equity segment, which sold for less than the initial carrying value subsequent to quarter ended June 30, 2016. The initial carrying value was based on the initial purchase price allocation of the asset, which utilized different assumptions than the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation, primarily being a longer holding period. The sale price of the asset was in line with the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation. Impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to impairment of goodwill on one reporting unit which management deemed to be impaired in our real estate equity segment.\nManagement Fee, Related Party\nManagement fee, related party relates to the management fee incurred to our Manager in our corporate segment (refer to Related Parties Arrangements\u201d below for more information). The management contract with our Manager commenced on November 1, 2015.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses primarily represent third-party service provider fees such as audit and legal fees and other compliance related fees related to portfolio management of our real estate equity segment. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to the full year impact of owning and managing the properties acquired in 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses are principally incurred in our corporate segment. The year ended December 31, 2016 represented a full year of operating as a stand-alone company, which included professional fees such as audit, internal audit, legal and other public company costs and includes an allocation of general and administrative expenses from our Manager of $0.2 million. The year ended December 31, 2015 primarily represent an allocation of certain costs and expenses related to activities for the launch of our European Real Estate Business prior to the Spin-off.\nCompensation Expense\nCompensation expense is comprised of non-cash amortization of time-based and performance equity-based based awards in our corporate segment. We began to incur compensation expense upon the Spin-off in November 2015. The year ended December 31, 2016 changes do not take into account the impact of the vesting as a result of the Mergers (refer to Item 8 Compensation Expense\u201d for more information).\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased due to 2016 being the first full year of ownership partially offset by the disposals of 18 properties during 2016 and assets being reclassified into held for sale in our real estate equity segment.\nOther Income (Loss)\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nUnrealized gain (loss) on investments and other is primarily related to the non-cash change in fair value of derivative instruments. The increase in the foreign currency forwards was decreased by the strengthened U.S. dollar against the U.K. Pound Sterling and the Euro. The decrease on the interest rate caps relates to the movement in European interests rates.\nThe following table presents a summary of unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other for the years

primarily related to the capital gain on the sale of real estate investments in our real estate equity segment. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 represents a net benefit of $0.7 million primarily related to deferred tax benefits in our real estate equity segment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur financing strategy is to employ investment-level financing to prudently leverage our investments and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders through a wide range of secured and unsecured debt and public and private equity capital sources to fund our investment activities. In addition to investment-specific financings, we may use and have used credit facilities and repaid facilities on a shorter term basis and public and private, secured and unsecured debt issuances on a longer term basis. Our current primary liquidity needs are to fund:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our operating expenses and investment activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>acquisitions of our target assets and related ongoing commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>capital improvements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>distributions to our stockholders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>principal and interest payments on our borrowings; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>income tax liabilities of taxable REIT subsidiaries and we are subject to limitations as a REIT.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our current primary sources of liquidity are:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cash flow generated from our investments, both from operations and return of capital\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>net proceeds from asset disposals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>financings secured by our assets such as mortgage notes, longer term senior and subordinate corporate capital such as revolving credit facilities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cash on hand.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We seek to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, including the repayment of borrowings and our investment funding needs, through existing cash resources, issuance of debt or equity capital, return of capital from investments and the liquidation or refinancing of assets. Nonetheless, our ability to meet a long-term (beyond one year) liquidity requirement may be subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing. Any decision by our lenders and investors to provide us with financing will depend upon a number of factors, such as our compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements, our financial performance, industry or market trends, the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions, such lenders' and investors' resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities.\nAs a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders, including taxable income where we do not receive corresponding cash, and we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and to avoid federal income tax and the non-deductible excise tax. On a quarterly basis, our Board determines an appropriate common stock dividend based upon numerous factors, including CAD, REIT qualification requirements, availability of existing cash balances, borrowing capacity under existing credit agreements, access to cash in the capital markets and other financing sources, our view of our ability to realize gains in the future through appreciation in the value of our assets, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impact our business or prospects. Future dividend levels are subject to adjustment based upon our evaluation of the factors described above, as well as other factors that our Board may, from time-to-time, deem relevant to consider when determining an appropriate common stock dividend.\nIn November 2015, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock. That authorization expired in November 2016 and at such time the Board authorized an additional repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock through November 2017. In March 2018, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization expires in March 2019, unless otherwise extended by our board of directors. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 5.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $58.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of our common stock for approximately $41.4 million. From the original authorization in November 2015 through December 31, 2017, we repurchased 9.3 million shares of its common stock for approximately $100.0 million.\nIn April 2017, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility, with a commitment of $35 million and with an initial two year term. The Credit Facility no longer contains a limitation on availability based on a borrowing base and the interest rate remains the same.\nIn March 2018, we amended the Credit Facility, increasing the size to $70 million and extending the term until April 2020 with one year extension option. The Credit Facility includes an accordion feature, providing for the ability to increase the facility to $105 million.\nIn June 2017, we amended and restated the Trias mortgage note agreement to increase the loan amount by $5.9 million and reduce future minimum capital expenditure spending requirements. In September 2017, we amended and restated the financing terms for $568 million of the SEB mortgage note agreement to reduce the margin from 1.80% to 1.55% and extended the maturity date from April 1, 2022 to July 20, 2024.\nWe believe that our existing sources of funds should be adequate for purposes of meeting our short-term liquidity needs. We expect our contractual rental income to be sufficient to meet our expected capital expenditures, interest expense, property operating and general and administrative expenses as well as common dividends declared by us. We may seek to raise additional capital in order to finance new acquisitions. Unrestricted cash as of March 9, 2018 was approximately $62 million and $70 million of availability under the Credit Facility.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our activity for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2017 represents our results of operations which includes the disposal of six assets and our preferred equity investment of $35.3 million (\u00a326.2 million).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2016 represents our results of operations for the first full year of activity as a stand-alone company.

The description of the management agreement included below relates to the Amended and Restated Management Agreement. Refer to Note 6 Related Party Arrangements\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a description of the terms of the original agreement that was entered into in November 2015 and which was superseded as of January 1, 2018 by the Amended and Restated Management Agreement.\nManagement Agreement Amendment\nUnder the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, the Asset Manager is generally responsible to manage our day to day operations, subject to the supervision and management of our Board. The Asset Manager is required to provide us with a management team and other appropriate employees and resources necessary to manage us.\nTerm; Renewals\nThe Amended and Restated Management Agreement provides for an initial term (beginning January 1, 2018) of five years, or the Initial Term, with subsequent automatic renewals for additional three-year terms, unless either party provides notice to the other party of its intention to decline to renew the agreement at least six months prior to the expiration of the then-current term. During the Initial Term, the Amended and Restated Management Agreement is terminable only for cause (as described in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement).\nIf we elect not to renew the Amended and Restated Management Agreement at the end of a term, we will be obligated to pay the Asset Manager a termination fee, or the Termination Fee, equal to three times the amount of the base management fees earned by the Asset Manager over the four most recent quarters immediately preceding the non-renewal. In addition, if at any time after the Initial Term, we undergo a change of control\u201d (as defined in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement), we may elect to terminate the agreement but upon any such termination it will be obligated to pay the Termination Fee to the Asset Manager.\nAssignment\nThe Amended and Restated Management Agreement provides that in the event of a change of control of the Asset Manager or other event that could be deemed an assignment of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, we will consider such assignment in good faith and not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay our consent. The Amended and Restated Management Agreement further provides that we anticipate consent would be granted for an assignment or deemed assignment to a party with expertise in commercial real estate and over $10 billion of assets under management. The Amended and Restated Management Agreement also provides that, notwithstanding anything in the agreement to the contrary, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, rules and regulations, in connection with any merger, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, change of control, reorganization, consolidation or any similar transaction by us or the Asset Manager, directly or indirectly, the surviving entity will succeed to the terms of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement.\nBase Management Fee\nPursuant to the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, beginning January 1, 2018, we are obligated to pay, quarterly, in arrears, in cash, the Asset Manager a base management fee per annum equal to:\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>1.50% of our reported EPRA NAV (as defined in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement) for EPRA NAV amounts up to and including $2.0 billion; plus\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>1.25% of our reported EPRA NAV on any EPRA NAV amount exceeding $2.0 billion.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> EPRA NAV is based on a U.S. GAAP balance sheet adjusted based on our interpretation of the European Public Real Estate Association, or EPRA, guidelines, and similar as prior practices, including adjustments such as fair value of operating real estate, straight-line rent and deferred taxes and additional adjustments to be determined by us in good faith based on any changes to U.S. GAAP, international accounting standards or EPRA guidelines. In calculating EPRA NAV, the liquidation preference of preferred securities outstanding shall not be included as a liability of us and shall not reduce EPRA NAV.\nIncentive Fee\nIn addition to the base management fees, we are obligated to pay the Asset Manager an incentive fee, if any, or the Incentive Fee, with respect to each measurement period equal to twenty percent (20%) of: (i) the excess of (a) our Total Stockholder Return (as defined in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, which includes stock price appreciation and dividends received and is subject to a high watermark price established when a prior incentive fee is realized) for the relevant measurement period above (b) a 10% cumulative annual hurdle rate, multiplied by (ii) our Weighted Average Shares (as defined in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement) during the measurement period. The first measurement period for the incentive fee will begin January 1, 2018 and end on December 31 of the applicable calendar year and subsequent measurement periods will begin on January 1 of the subsequent calendar year. Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4(d) of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement for common stock payments, we may elect to pay the Incentive Fee, if any, in cash or in shares of restricted common stock or shares of unrestricted common stock repurchased by us in the open market or a combination thereof. Any shares of common stock delivered by us will be subject to lock-up restrictions that will be released in equal one-third increments on each anniversary of the end of the measurement period with respect to which such incentive fee was earned. In calculating the value of the shares of our common stock paid in satisfaction of the Incentive Fee obligation, the shares of restricted common stock will be valued at the higher of: (i) the volume weighted average trading price per share for the ten consecutive trading days (as defined in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement) ending on the trading day prior to the date the payment is due and (ii) our EPRA NAV per share, based on our most recently published EPRA NAV and the Weighted Average Shares as of the end of the period with respect to which such EPRA NAV was published.\nCosts and Expenses\nWe are responsible to pay (or reimburse the Asset Manager) for all of our direct, out of pocket costs and expenses as a stand alone company incurred by or on behalf of us and our subsidiaries, all of which must be reasonable, customary and documented. Internalized Service Costs (as defined below) are not intended to be covered costs and expenses under this provision and are subject to the limits described in the next paragraph.\nIn addition to the expenses described in the prior paragraph, for each calendar quarter, beginning with the first quarter of 2018, we are obligated to reimburse the Asset Manager for (i) all direct, reasonable, customary and documented costs and expenses incurred by the Asset Manager for salaries, wages, bonuses, payroll taxes and employee benefits for personnel employed by the Asset Manager: (a) who solely provide services to us which prior to January 1, 2018 were provided by unaffiliated third parties, including accounting and treasury services or (b) who were hired by the Asset Manager after January 1, 2018 but who solely provide services to us in respect of one of the categories of services previously internalized pursuant to clause (a) and who were not hired in connection with any event which otherwise resulted in an increase to our net asset value (such costs and expenses set forth in clauses (i) and (ii), the Internalized Service Costs\u201d), plus (ii) 20% of the amount calculated under clause (i) to cover\nreasonable overhead charges with respect to such personnel, provided that we shall not be obligated to reimburse the Asset Manager for such costs and expenses to the extent they exceed the following quarterly limits:\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>0.0375% of our aggregate gross asset value as of the end of the prior calendar quarter (excluding cash and cash equivalents and certain other exclusions) as calculated for purposes of determining EPRA NAV, or GAV, for GAV amounts to and including $2.5 billion, plus\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>0.0313% of GAV amounts between $2.5 billion and $5.0 billion, plus\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>0.025% of GAV amounts exceeding $5.0 billion.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> If the Asset Manager's actual Internalized Service Costs during any quarter exceed the quarterly limit described in the preceding paragraph (the cumulative excess amounts, if any, in respect of each quarter during a calendar year, is referred to as the Quarterly Cap Excess Amount we are obligated to reimburse the Asset Manager on an annual basis for an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Quarterly Cap Excess Amount and (ii) the sum of the amounts, if any, determined for each quarter within such calendar year by which Internalized Services Costs in respect of such quarter were less than the quarterly limits described in the prior paragraph.\nEquity Based Compensation\nIn addition, we expect to make annual equity compensation grants to our management and other employees of the Asset Manager, provided that the aggregate annual grant amount, type and other terms of such equity compensation must be approved by our compensation committee. The Asset Manager will have discretion in allocating the aggregate grant among our management and other employees of the Asset Manager.\nUnder the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, beginning with our 2018 annual stockholders' meeting, the Asset Manager will have the right to nominate one director (who is expected to be one of our current directors employed by the Asset Manager) to our board of directors.\nTransaction Expenses\nWe agreed to pay for up to $2.5 million of fees and expenses payable by the Asset Manager to its external financial advisors in connection with the negotiation and execution of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement.\nColony NorthStar Ownership Waiver and Voting Agreement\nIn connection with the entry into the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, we provided Colony NorthStar with an ownership waiver under our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, allowing Colony NorthStar to purchase up to 45% of our stock. The waiver provides that if the Amended and Restated Management Agreement is terminated, Colony NorthStar may not purchase any shares of our common stock to the extent Colony NorthStar owns (or would own as a result of such purchase) more than 9.8% of our capital stock. In connection with the waiver, Colony NorthStar also agreed that for all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, to the extent Colony NorthStar owns more than 25% of our common stock (such shares owned by Colony NorthStar in excess of the 25% threshold, refer to as the Excess Shares, it will vote the Excess Shares in the same proportion that our remaining shares not owned by Colony NorthStar or its affiliates are voted. If the Amended and Restated Management Agreement is terminated, then beginning on the third anniversary of such termination, the threshold described in the prior sentence will be reduced from 25% to 9.8%.\nManager Ownership of Common Stock\nAs of December 31, 2017, Colony NorthStar and its subsidiaries owned 5.6 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 10.2% of the total outstanding common stock.\nRecent Developments\nDividends\nOn March 7, 2018, we declared a dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock. The common stock dividend will be paid on March 23, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2018.\nShare Repurchase\nIn March 2018, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization expires in March 2019, unless otherwise extended by our board of directors.\nDisposals\nIn February 2018, we agreed a definitive sale and purchase agreement to sell the Maastoren property, our largest non-core asset, for approximately $190 million. We expect to release approximately $60 million of net equity after repayment of financing (including release premium) and transaction costs.\nCredit Facility\nIn March 2018, we amended the Credit Facility, increasing the size to $70 million and extending the term until April 2020 with one year extension option. The Credit Facility includes an accordion feature, providing for the ability to increase the facility to $105 million.\nInflation\nVirtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other factors influence our performance significantly more than inflation does. A change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates may correlate with changes in inflation rates. With the exception of the United Kingdom, rent is generally adjusted annually based on local consumer price indices. In the United Kingdom, rent is typically subject to an upward only rent review approximately every three to five years.\nRefer to", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II.

As part of the Mergers, NSAM changed its name to Colony NorthStar, Inc.\nSummary of Business\nOur primary business line is investing in European real estate. We are predominantly focused on prime office properties in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France.\nSources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flows\nWe primarily generate revenue from rental and other operating income from our properties and interest income from our preferred equity investment. Our income is primarily derived through the difference between the revenue and the operating and financing expenses of our investments. We may also continue to acquire investments that generate attractive returns without any leverage.\nProfitability and Performance Metrics\nWe calculate cash available for distribution, or CAD, and NOI, as metrics to evaluate the profitability and performance of our business (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a description of these metrics).\nOutlook and Recent Trends\nThe European economy grew at its fastest rate in a decade during 2017, with Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, growing by 2.5% in both the European Union, EU, and the Euro Area. The region's robust economic performance was underpinned by strong global economic growth driving European exports, fueling corporate profits and resulting in an increase in overall confidence and investment levels. Unemployment in the EU continued to fall, reaching 7.3% in December 2017, down from 8.2% a year earlier and the lowest level recorded since October 2008.\nIn February 2018, the European Commission, or EC, revised its 2018 GDP forecast for the Euro Area up by 0.2% to 2.3% citing continued strength in domestic demand and investment levels. The 2019 Euro Area outlook has also been revised upwards to 2.0%, 0.1% above the November forecast.\nThis stronger than anticipated economic growth resulted in the European Central Bank, or ECB, signaling its intention to begin tapering while citing that, any tightening of monetary policy is likely to be gradual and subject to ongoing review based on the future economic performance and inflation outlook of the region. On March 8, 2018, the ECB announced its decision to maintain interest rates at zero percent and confirmed its intention to continue with its asset purchase program of \u20ac30 billion per month through September 2018, and beyond if necessary. The ECB's expectations are that inflation, which stood at 1.3% in January 2018, will remain below its target of just under 2% through 2019.\nFollowing the Dutch, German and French elections last year, geopolitical uncertainty in the region appears to have receded. However, the prominence of certain Eurosceptic parties in the recent Italian parliamentary elections suggests that the risk of further geopolitical tremors in the region may not have completely disappeared.\nIn contrast with the overall European economy, the U.K. economy began to slow in 2017, posting 0.5% growth during the fourth quarter, and 1.8% for the full year 2017, as uncertainty associated with Brexit weighed on business sentiment and investment while elevated levels of inflation due to a weaker U.K. Pound Sterling eroded real incomes and began to dampen consumer demand. The EC forecasts the U.K. economy to grow by 1.4% and 1.1% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. On November 2, 2017 the Bank of England, or BOE, raised the U.K. base interest rate from 0.25% to 0.5%, the first interest rate rise in a decade, in an effort to contain inflation which stood at 3.1% in the year to December, well above the BOE's stated target of 2.0%. The BOE signaled that any further increases were likely to be at a gradual pace and limited in number. This cautious tone is reflective of the outlook for the U.K. economy which, despite its relatively resilient performance since the referendum, remains uncertain and likely to be dependent on the duration and perceived outcome of ongoing Brexit negotiations.\nEuropean commercial real estate investment volume totaled \u20ac89 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 and \u20ac291 billion in the full year 2017, 11% above its 2016 level. Office remained the most sought after asset class in Europe, representing approximately 40% of the total 2017 transaction volume. Prime property yields in most asset classes and markets were stable during the fourth quarter and continue to remain at a significant premium to sovereign yields.\nStrong office occupier demand (10% year on year growth in take up) coupled with modest supply across all major European markets continued to place downward pressure on vacancy throughout 2017, which during the fourth quarter decreased to their\nlowest levels since 2008. These robust occupational markets coupled with higher level of inflation continued to place upward pressure on rents.\nDriven by strong demand for office properties, which represented more than 50% of the total transaction volume during the year, German real estate investment reached \u20ac57.4 billion in 2017 (\u20ac18 billion in the fourth quarter), 9% above 2016 and the second highest level after 2007. Take up across the top 6 German cities increased by 11% year over year that coupled with constrained office supply created positive pressure on rents that rose 3.4% year over year in 2017.\nTotal U.K. investment volume reached \u00a316.4 billion in the fourth quarter and \u00a363.3 billion during 2017, a 20% increase on 2016 investment volume. Central London office investment volume totaled \u00a33.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, bringing the year-end total to \u00a316.4 billion, 26% higher than 2016 and the fourth highest annual total on record. Take-up in Central London was 15% ahead of 2016 with flexible workplace providers accounting for more than 21% of all leasing volumes in 2017.\nDriven by a number of large transactions completed during the fourth quarter, French investment volume was \u20ac12 billion in the fourth quarter 2017, 9% above the same period last year. Total 2017 investment volume was 27 billion, 5% below 2016 due in part to the ongoing shortage of high quality stock. The Paris occupational market remains robust with the Class A vacancy rate reaching a five year low in December 2017, and placing upward pressure on rents.\nOur Strategy\nWe seek to provide our stockholders with a stable and recurring cash flow for distribution supplemented by capital growth over time. Our business is predominantly focused on prime office properties located in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France. These are not only the largest economies in Europe, but the largest, most established, liquid and among the most stable office markets in Europe. We seek to utilize our established local networks to source suitable investment opportunities. We have a long term investment approach and expect to make equity investments, directly or indirectly through joint ventures.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor recent accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our business, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nThe following presents a summary of our activity for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2017 represents our results of operations which includes the disposal of six assets for net proceeds of $132.5 million and our preferred equity investment of $35.3 million (\u00a326.2 million). \n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2016 represents our results of operations for the first full year of activity as a stand-alone company. During 2016, we disposed of 18 assets for net proceeds of $406.9 million. \n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2015 represents: (i) our results of operations following the Spin-off and two months of activity as a stand-alone company; and (ii) our results of operations of the European Real Estate Business as if the transferred business was the business for the periods in which common control was present and an allocation of costs related to us for the period from January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2015. We acquired 49 assets across nine countries in April 2015 and Trianon Tower in July 2015. In December 2015, we disposed of three assets for net proceeds of $21.0 million.

Rental income decreased $19.0 million, primarily due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016.\nEscalation Income\nEscalation income consists of tenant recoveries in our real estate equity segment. Escalation income decreased $3.5 million, primarily due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016 and the timing of certain recoverable expenses. There is a corresponding decrease in properties - operating expenses and a majority of these costs are recovered from our tenants.\nInterest Income\nInterest income relates to our preferred equity investment originated in the second quarter 2017 in our preferred equity segment.\nOther Income\nOther income is principally related to lease surrender premiums, insurance refunds and termination fees in our real estate equity segment. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2017 predominantly represents lease surrender premium payments. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2016 represents early termination of two tenants whose spaces were subsequently re-let.\nExpenses\nProperties - Operating Expenses\nProperties - operating expenses decreased $4.8 million due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016 partially offset by a straight-line rent write-off related to an early tenant termination at Portman Square in connection with the Invesco expansion. There is a corresponding decrease in escalation income and a majority of these costs are recovered from our tenants.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $15.6 million due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016 and corresponding repayments of certain mortgage notes and due to the refinancing of certain mortgage notes in our real estate equity segment in the third quarter 2017 and the repayment of our senior stock-settlable notes in our corporate segment in 2016.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily related to costs associated with amending the management agreement in our corporate segment and other acquisition costs in our preferred equity segment. In addition, a transaction fee was paid to a third party and reimbursed in total by the entity that originated our preferred equity investment resulting in no impact to transaction costs. Transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily related to costs associated with exploring potential transactions and the Mergers in our corporate segment.\nImpairment losses\nImpairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to impairment of one of our held-for-sale assets in our real estate equity segment, which sold in 2016 for less than the initial carrying value. The initial carrying value was based on the initial purchase price allocation of the asset, which utilized different assumptions than the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation, primarily being a longer holding period. The sale price of the asset was in line with the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation.\nManagement Fee, Related Party\nManagement fee, related party relates to the management fee incurred to our Manager in our corporate segment (refer to Related Parties Arrangements\u201d below for more information).\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses primarily represent third-party service provider fees such as asset management, accounting, tax, legal fees and other compliance related fees related to portfolio management of our real estate equity segment. The decrease of $3.1 million is due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016 partially offset by one time fees associated with the termination of certain third-party property accountants.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses including external and internal audit, legal fees and other corporate expenses are incurred in our corporate segment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Manager did not allocate any general and administrative expenses to us. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our Manager allocated $0.2 million.\nCompensation Expense\nCompensation expense is comprised of non-cash amortization of time-based, market-based and performance-based awards in our corporate segment. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017, is mainly due to the acceleration of a material portion of our time-based equity awards due to the Mergers which occurred in the first quarter of 2017. Refer to Note 7 Compensation Expense\u201d and Note 8 Stockholders' Equity\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further information.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016 in our real estate equity segment partially, offset by the write-off of intangibles due to lease terminations in the third quarter 2017.\nOther Income (Loss)\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Derivatives and Other\nUnrealized gain (loss) on derivatives and other is primarily related to the non-cash change in fair value of derivative instruments. The loss related to foreign currency forwards used to hedge projected net property level cash flows in our corporate segment was primarily due to the strengthened Euro against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in the loss related to the interest rate caps in our real estate equity segment is due to the movement in European interest rate in 2017 compared to 2016.\nThe following table presents a summary of unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives and other for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

Same store net operating income is presented for the same store portfolio, which represents all properties that were owned by us in the end of the reporting period. We define same store net operating income as NOI excluding (i) properties that were acquired or sold during the period, (ii) impact of foreign currency changes and (iii) amortization of above/below market leases. We consider same store net operating income to be an appropriate and useful supplemental performance measure. Same store net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, our methodology for calculating same store net operating income involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies. Refer below for a reconciliation of same store NOI to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Same Store Revenue\nSame store rental income increased driven primarily by recent leasing activity and rent reviews completed during the year including Deutsche Bundesbank commencing occupation in the Trianon Tower (completed in January 2018). Same store other income decreased due to one-time early termination premiums in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSame Store Expense\nSame store properties - operating expenses decreased due to lower repairs and maintenance partially offset by the timing of certain recoverable expenses and a straight-line rent write-off related to an early tenant termination at Portman Square in connection with the Invesco expansion.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Same Store\nThe following table presents a reconciliation from net income (loss) to same store net operating income for the real estate equity segment for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Same Store Reconciliation\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate segment net (income) loss(1)\n</td> <td>13,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) loss(2)\n</td> <td>8,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(430\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income\n</td> <td>24,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sale of real estate investments and other(3)\n</td> <td>(349\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,193\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income(4)\n</td> <td>(705\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same store net operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n (1) Includes management fees, general and administrative expense, compensation expense, corporate interest expense and corporate transaction costs. \n (2) Includes depreciation and amortization expense, unrealized loss on interest rate caps, and other expenses in the real estate equity segment. \n (3) Represents the impact of assets sold during the period. \n (4) Represents interest income earned in the preferred equity segment. \n (5) Three months ended December 31, 2016 is translated using the average exchange rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017.

Rental income increased $23.3 million, primarily due to 2016 being the first full year since acquisition and leases signed in 2016 partially offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016 and the vacancy of a tenant in the Trianon Tower in the fourth quarter 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 27,000 square meters of leases were signed and renegotiated in our real estate equity segment generating a revenue increase of $5 million.\nEscalation Income\nEscalation income consists of tenant recoveries in our real estate equity segment. Escalation income increased $6.4 million, primarily due to 2016 being the first full year since acquisition, leases signed in 2016 resulting in higher recoverability partially offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016. There is a corresponding increase in properties operating expenses and a majority of these costs are recoverable from the tenants.\nOther Income\nOther income is principally related to lease termination fees in our real estate equity segment. Other revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the early termination of two tenants whose spaces were subsequently re-let.\nExpenses\nProperties - Operating Expenses\nProperties - operating expenses increased $9.3 million due to 2016 being the first full year of since acquisition partially offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016. There is a corresponding increase in escalation income and a majority of these costs are recovered from our tenants.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $5.3 million due to 2016 being the first full year since acquisition and financing partially offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016 and the refinancing of certain mortgage notes in our real estate equity segment.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relate to costs associated with exploring potential transactions in our real estate equity segment and costs related to the Mergers in our corporate segment. Transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily represented expenses such as real estate transfer tax and professional fees related to the acquisitions in 2015 in our real estate equity segment and the Spin-off in our corporate segment.\nImpairment losses\nImpairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to impairment of one of our held-for-sale assets in our real estate equity segment, which sold for less than the initial carrying value subsequent to quarter ended June 30, 2016. The initial carrying value was based on the initial purchase price allocation of the asset, which utilized different assumptions than the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation, primarily being a longer holding period. The sale price of the asset was in line with the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation. Impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to impairment of goodwill on one reporting unit which management deemed to be impaired in our real estate equity segment.\nManagement Fee, Related Party\nManagement fee, related party relates to the management fee incurred to our Manager in our corporate segment (refer to Related Parties Arrangements\u201d below for more information). The management contract with our Manager commenced on November 1, 2015.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses primarily represent third-party service provider fees such as audit and legal fees and other compliance related fees related to portfolio management of our real estate equity segment. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to the full year impact of owning and managing the properties acquired in 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses are principally incurred in our corporate segment. The year ended December 31, 2016 represented a full year of operating as a stand-alone company, which included professional fees such as audit, internal audit, legal and other public company costs and includes an allocation of general and administrative expenses from our Manager of $0.2 million. The year ended December 31, 2015 primarily represent an allocation of certain costs and expenses related to activities for the launch of our European Real Estate Business prior to the Spin-off.\nCompensation Expense\nCompensation expense is comprised of non-cash amortization of time-based and performance equity-based based awards in our corporate segment. We began to incur compensation expense upon the Spin-off in November 2015. The year ended December 31, 2016 changes do not take into account the impact of the vesting as a result of the Mergers (refer to Item 8 Compensation Expense\u201d for more information).\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased due to 2016 being the first full year of ownership partially offset by the disposals of 18 properties during 2016 and assets being reclassified into held for sale in our real estate equity segment.\nOther Income (Loss)\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nUnrealized gain (loss) on investments and other is primarily related to the non-cash change in fair value of derivative instruments. The increase in the foreign currency forwards was decreased by the strengthened U.S. dollar against the U.K. Pound Sterling and the Euro. The decrease on the interest rate caps relates to the movement in European interests rates.\nThe following table presents a summary of unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other for the years

relation to the sales. \n (2) Includes $17.7 million relating to the reclassification of the currency translation adjustment from a component of accumulated OCI to realized gain (losses) due to the sale of certain real estate assets, offset by the realized loss on the repayment of the intercompany loans in different currencies. \n (3) Includes the write-off of deferred financing costs due to the repayment of certain mortgage and other notes payable in the real estate equity segment and our senior stock-settlable notes repurchases in the corporate segment.  Income Tax Benefit (Expense)\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 represents a net expense of $2.7 million primarily related to the capital gain on the sale of real estate investments in our real estate equity segment. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 represents a net benefit of $0.7 million primarily related to deferred tax benefits in our real estate equity segment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur financing strategy is to employ investment-level financing to prudently leverage our investments and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders through a wide range of secured and unsecured debt and public and private equity capital sources to fund our investment activities. In addition to investment-specific financings, we may use and have used credit facilities and repaid facilities on a shorter term basis and public and private, secured and unsecured debt issuances on a longer term basis. Our current primary liquidity needs are to fund:\n \u2022 our operating expenses and investment activities; \n \u2022 acquisitions of our target assets and related ongoing commitments; \n \u2022 capital improvements \n \u2022 distributions to our stockholders; \n \u2022 principal and interest payments on our borrowings; and \n \u2022 income tax liabilities of taxable REIT subsidiaries and we are subject to limitations as a REIT.  Our current primary sources of liquidity are:\n \u2022 cash flow generated from our investments, both from operations and return of capital \n \u2022 net proceeds from asset disposals; \n \u2022 financings secured by our assets such as mortgage notes, longer term senior and subordinate corporate capital such as revolving credit facilities; and \n \u2022 cash on hand.  We seek to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, including the repayment of borrowings and our investment funding needs, through existing cash resources, issuance of debt or equity capital, return of capital from investments and the liquidation or refinancing of assets. Nonetheless, our ability to meet a long-term (beyond one year) liquidity requirement may be subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing. Any decision by our lenders and investors to provide us with financing will depend upon a number of factors, such as our compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements, our financial performance, industry or market trends, the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions, such lenders' and investors' resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities.\nAs a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders, including taxable income where we do not receive corresponding cash, and we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and to avoid federal income tax and the non-deductible excise tax. On a quarterly basis, our Board determines an appropriate common stock dividend based upon numerous factors, including CAD, REIT qualification requirements, availability of existing cash balances, borrowing capacity under existing credit agreements, access to cash in the capital markets and other financing sources, our view of our ability to realize gains in the future through appreciation in the value of our assets, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impact our business or prospects. Future dividend levels are subject to adjustment based upon our evaluation of the factors described above, as well as other factors that our Board may, from time-to-time, deem relevant to consider when determining an appropriate common stock dividend.\nIn November 2015, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock. That authorization expired in November 2016 and at such time the Board authorized an additional repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock through November 2017. In March 2018, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization expires in March 2019, unless otherwise extended by our board of directors. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 5.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $58.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of our common stock for approximately $41.4 million. From the original authorization in November 2015 through December 31, 2017, we repurchased 9.3 million shares of its common stock for approximately $100.0 million.\nIn April 2017, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility, with a commitment of $35 million and with an initial two year term. The Credit Facility no longer contains a limitation on availability based on a borrowing base and the interest rate remains the same.\nIn March 2018, we amended the Credit Facility, increasing the size to $70 million and extending the term until April 2020 with one year extension option. The Credit Facility includes an accordion feature, providing for the ability to increase the facility to $105 million.\nIn June 2017, we amended and restated the Trias mortgage note agreement to increase the loan amount by $5.9 million and reduce future minimum capital expenditure spending requirements. In September 2017, we amended and restated the financing terms for $568 million of the SEB mortgage note agreement to reduce the margin from 1.80% to 1.55% and extended the maturity date from April 1, 2022 to July 20, 2024.\nWe believe that our existing sources of funds should be adequate for purposes of meeting our short-term liquidity needs. We expect our contractual rental income to be sufficient to meet our expected capital expenditures, interest expense, property operating and general and administrative expenses as well as common dividends declared by us. We may seek to raise additional capital in order to finance new acquisitions. Unrestricted cash as of March 9, 2018 was approximately $62 million and $70 million of availability under the Credit Facility.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our activity for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2017 represents our results of operations which includes the disposal of six assets and our preferred equity investment of $35.3 million (\u00a326.2 million). \n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2016 represents our results of operations for the first full year of activity as a stand-alone company. During 2016, we disposed of 18 assets. \n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2015 represents: (i) our results of operations following the Spin-off and two months of activity as a stand-alone company; and (ii) our results of operations of the European Real Estate Business as if the transferred business was the business for the periods in which common control was present and an allocation of costs related to us for the period from January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2015.

In December 2015, we disposed of three assets. \nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(50,180\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,900,532\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(119,571\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(630,856\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,231,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign currency translation on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,434\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>890\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,643\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(217,536\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>281,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to December 31, 2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $28.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The description of the management agreement included below relates to the Amended and Restated Management Agreement. Refer to Note 6 Related Party Arrangements\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a description of the terms of the original agreement that was entered into in November 2015 and which was superseded as of January 1, 2018 by the Amended and Restated Management Agreement.\nManagement Agreement Amendment\nUnder the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, the Asset Manager is generally responsible to manage our day to day operations, subject to the supervision and management of our Board. The Asset Manager is required to provide us with a management team and other appropriate employees and resources necessary to manage us.\nTerm; Renewals\nThe Amended and Restated Management Agreement provides for an initial term (beginning January 1, 2018) of five years, or the Initial Term, with subsequent automatic renewals for additional three-year terms, unless either party provides notice to the other party of its intention to decline to renew the agreement at least six months prior to the expiration of the then-current term. During the Initial Term, the Amended and Restated Management Agreement is terminable only for cause (as described in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement).\nIf we elect not to renew the Amended and Restated Management Agreement at the end of a term, we will be obligated to pay the Asset Manager a termination fee, or the Termination Fee, equal to three times the amount of the base management fees earned by the Asset Manager over the four most recent quarters immediately preceding the non-renewal. In addition, if at any time after the Initial Term, we undergo a change of control\u201d (as defined in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement), we may elect to terminate the agreement but upon any such termination it will be obligated to pay the Termination Fee to the Asset Manager.\nAssignment\nThe Amended and Restated Management Agreement provides that in the event of a change of control of the Asset Manager or other event that could be deemed an assignment of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, we will consider such assignment in good faith and not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay our consent. The Amended and Restated Management Agreement further provides that we anticipate consent would be granted for an assignment or deemed assignment to a party with expertise in commercial real estate and over $10 billion of assets under management. The Amended and Restated Management Agreement also provides that, notwithstanding anything in the agreement to the contrary, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, rules and regulations, in connection with any merger, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, change of control, reorganization, consolidation or any similar transaction by us or the Asset Manager, directly or indirectly, the surviving entity will succeed to the terms of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement.\nBase Management Fee\nPursuant to the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, beginning January 1, 2018, we are obligated to pay, quarterly, in arrears, in cash, the Asset Manager a base management fee per annum equal to:\n \u2022 1.50% of our reported EPRA NAV (as defined in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement) for EPRA NAV amounts up to and including $2.0 billion; plus \n \u2022 1.25% of our reported EPRA NAV on any EPRA NAV amount exceeding $2.0 billion.  EPRA NAV is based on a U.S. GAAP balance sheet adjusted based on our interpretation of the European Public Real Estate Association, or EPRA, guidelines, and similar as prior practices, including adjustments such as fair value of operating real estate, straight-line rent and deferred taxes and additional adjustments to be determined by us in good faith based on any changes to U.S. GAAP, international accounting standards or EPRA guidelines. In calculating EPRA NAV, the liquidation preference of preferred securities outstanding shall not be included as a liability of us and shall not reduce EPRA NAV.\nIncentive Fee\nIn addition to the base management fees, we are obligated to pay the Asset Manager an incentive fee, if any, or the Incentive Fee, with respect to each measurement period equal to twenty percent (20%) of: (i) the excess of (a) our Total Stockholder Return (as defined in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, which includes stock price appreciation and dividends received and is subject to a high watermark price established when a prior incentive fee is realized) for the relevant measurement period above (b) a 10% cumulative annual hurdle rate, multiplied by (ii) our Weighted Average Shares (as defined in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement) during the measurement period. The first measurement period for the incentive fee will begin January 1, 2018 and end on December 31 of the applicable calendar year and subsequent measurement periods will begin on January 1 of the subsequent calendar year. Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4(d) of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement for common stock payments, we may elect to pay the Incentive Fee, if any, in cash or in shares of restricted common stock or shares of unrestricted common stock repurchased by us in the open market or a combination thereof. Any shares of common stock delivered by us will be subject to lock-up restrictions that will be released in equal one-third increments on each anniversary of the end of the measurement period with respect to which such incentive fee was earned. In calculating the value of the shares of our common stock paid in satisfaction of the Incentive Fee obligation, the shares of restricted common stock will be valued at the higher of: (i) the volume weighted average trading price per share for the ten consecutive trading days (as defined in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement) ending on the trading day prior to the date the payment is due and (ii) our EPRA NAV per share, based on our most recently published EPRA NAV and the Weighted Average Shares as of the end of the period with respect to which such EPRA NAV was published.\nCosts and Expenses\nWe are responsible to pay (or reimburse the Asset Manager) for all of our direct, out of pocket costs and expenses as a stand alone company incurred by or on behalf of us and our subsidiaries, all of which must be reasonable, customary and documented.

If the Asset Manager's actual Internalized Service Costs during any quarter exceed the quarterly limit described in the preceding paragraph (the cumulative excess amounts, if any, in respect of each quarter during a calendar year, is referred to as the Quarterly Cap Excess Amount we are obligated to reimburse the Asset Manager on an annual basis for an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Quarterly Cap Excess Amount and (ii) the sum of the amounts, if any, determined for each quarter within such calendar year by which Internalized Services Costs in respect of such quarter were less than the quarterly limits described in the prior paragraph.\nEquity Based Compensation\nIn addition, we expect to make annual equity compensation grants to our management and other employees of the Asset Manager, provided that the aggregate annual grant amount, type and other terms of such equity compensation must be approved by our compensation committee. The Asset Manager will have discretion in allocating the aggregate grant among our management and other employees of the Asset Manager.\nUnder the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, beginning with our 2018 annual stockholders' meeting, the Asset Manager will have the right to nominate one director (who is expected to be one of our current directors employed by the Asset Manager) to our board of directors.\nTransaction Expenses\nWe agreed to pay for up to $2.5 million of fees and expenses payable by the Asset Manager to its external financial advisors in connection with the negotiation and execution of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement.\nColony NorthStar Ownership Waiver and Voting Agreement\nIn connection with the entry into the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, we provided Colony NorthStar with an ownership waiver under our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, allowing Colony NorthStar to purchase up to 45% of our stock. The waiver provides that if the Amended and Restated Management Agreement is terminated, Colony NorthStar may not purchase any shares of our common stock to the extent Colony NorthStar owns (or would own as a result of such purchase) more than 9.8% of our capital stock. In connection with the waiver, Colony NorthStar also agreed that for all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, to the extent Colony NorthStar owns more than 25% of our common stock (such shares owned by Colony NorthStar in excess of the 25% threshold, refer to as the Excess Shares, it will vote the Excess Shares in the same proportion that our remaining shares not owned by Colony NorthStar or its affiliates are voted. If the Amended and Restated Management Agreement is terminated, then beginning on the third anniversary of such termination, the threshold described in the prior sentence will be reduced from 25% to 9.8%.\nManager Ownership of Common Stock\nAs of December 31, 2017, Colony NorthStar and its subsidiaries owned 5.6 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 10.2% of the total outstanding common stock.\nRecent Developments\nDividends\nOn March 7, 2018, we declared a dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock. The common stock dividend will be paid on March 23, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2018.\nShare Repurchase\nIn March 2018, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization expires in March 2019, unless otherwise extended by our board of directors.\nDisposals\nIn February 2018, we agreed a definitive sale and purchase agreement to sell the Maastoren property, our largest non-core asset, for approximately $190 million. We expect to release approximately $60 million of net equity after repayment of financing (including release premium) and transaction costs.\nCredit Facility\nIn March 2018, we amended the Credit Facility, increasing the size to $70 million and extending the term until April 2020 with one year extension option. The Credit Facility includes an accordion feature, providing for the ability to increase the facility to $105 million.\nInflation\nVirtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other factors influence our performance significantly more than inflation does. A change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates may correlate with changes in inflation rates. With the exception of the United Kingdom, rent is generally adjusted annually based on local consumer price indices. In the United Kingdom, rent is typically subject to an upward only rent review approximately every three to five years.\nRefer to", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II.

As part of the Mergers, NSAM changed its name to Colony NorthStar, Inc.\nSummary of Business\nOur primary business line is investing in European real estate. We are predominantly focused on prime office properties in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France.\nSources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flows\nWe primarily generate revenue from rental and other operating income from our properties and interest income from our preferred equity investment. Our income is primarily derived through the difference between the revenue and the operating and financing expenses of our investments. We may also continue to acquire investments that generate attractive returns without any leverage.\nProfitability and Performance Metrics\nWe calculate cash available for distribution, or CAD, and NOI, as metrics to evaluate the profitability and performance of our business (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a description of these metrics).\nOutlook and Recent Trends\nThe European economy grew at its fastest rate in a decade during 2017, with Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, growing by 2.5% in both the European Union, EU, and the Euro Area. The region's robust economic performance was underpinned by strong global economic growth driving European exports, fueling corporate profits and resulting in an increase in overall confidence and investment levels. Unemployment in the EU continued to fall, reaching 7.3% in December 2017, down from 8.2% a year earlier and the lowest level recorded since October 2008.\nIn February 2018, the European Commission, or EC, revised its 2018 GDP forecast for the Euro Area up by 0.2% to 2.3% citing continued strength in domestic demand and investment levels. The 2019 Euro Area outlook has also been revised upwards to 2.0%, 0.1% above the November forecast.\nThis stronger than anticipated economic growth resulted in the European Central Bank, or ECB, signaling its intention to begin tapering while citing that, any tightening of monetary policy is likely to be gradual and subject to ongoing review based on the future economic performance and inflation outlook of the region. On March 8, 2018, the ECB announced its decision to maintain interest rates at zero percent and confirmed its intention to continue with its asset purchase program of \u20ac30 billion per month through September 2018, and beyond if necessary. The ECB's expectations are that inflation, which stood at 1.3% in January 2018, will remain below its target of just under 2% through 2019.\nFollowing the Dutch, German and French elections last year, geopolitical uncertainty in the region appears to have receded. However, the prominence of certain Eurosceptic parties in the recent Italian parliamentary elections suggests that the risk of further geopolitical tremors in the region may not have completely disappeared.\nIn contrast with the overall European economy, the U.K. economy began to slow in 2017, posting 0.5% growth during the fourth quarter, and 1.8% for the full year 2017, as uncertainty associated with Brexit weighed on business sentiment and investment while elevated levels of inflation due to a weaker U.K. Pound Sterling eroded real incomes and began to dampen consumer demand. The EC forecasts the U.K. economy to grow by 1.4% and 1.1% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. On November 2, 2017 the Bank of England, or BOE, raised the U.K. base interest rate from 0.25% to 0.5%, the first interest rate rise in a decade, in an effort to contain inflation which stood at 3.1% in the year to December, well above the BOE's stated target of 2.0%. The BOE signaled that any further increases were likely to be at a gradual pace and limited in number. This cautious tone is reflective of the outlook for the U.K. economy which, despite its relatively resilient performance since the referendum, remains uncertain and likely to be dependent on the duration and perceived outcome of ongoing Brexit negotiations.\nEuropean commercial real estate investment volume totaled \u20ac89 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 and \u20ac291 billion in the full year 2017, 11% above its 2016 level. Office remained the most sought after asset class in Europe, representing approximately 40% of the total 2017 transaction volume. Prime property yields in most asset classes and markets were stable during the fourth quarter and continue to remain at a significant premium to sovereign yields.\nStrong office occupier demand (10% year on year growth in take up) coupled with modest supply across all major European markets continued to place downward pressure on vacancy throughout 2017, which during the fourth quarter decreased to their\nlowest levels since 2008. These robust occupational markets coupled with higher level of inflation continued to place upward pressure on rents.\nDriven by strong demand for office properties, which represented more than 50% of the total transaction volume during the year, German real estate investment reached \u20ac57.4 billion in 2017 (\u20ac18 billion in the fourth quarter), 9% above 2016 and the second highest level after 2007. Take up across the top 6 German cities increased by 11% year over year that coupled with constrained office supply created positive pressure on rents that rose 3.4% year over year in 2017.\nTotal U.K. investment volume reached \u00a316.4 billion in the fourth quarter and \u00a363.3 billion during 2017, a 20% increase on 2016 investment volume. Central London office investment volume totaled \u00a33.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017, bringing the year-end total to \u00a316.4 billion, 26% higher than 2016 and the fourth highest annual total on record. Take-up in Central London was 15% ahead of 2016 with flexible workplace providers accounting for more than 21% of all leasing volumes in 2017.\nDriven by a number of large transactions completed during the fourth quarter, French investment volume was \u20ac12 billion in the fourth quarter 2017, 9% above the same period last year. Total 2017 investment volume was 27 billion, 5% below 2016 due in part to the ongoing shortage of high quality stock. The Paris occupational market remains robust with the Class A vacancy rate reaching a five year low in December 2017, and placing upward pressure on rents.\nOur Strategy\nWe seek to provide our stockholders with a stable and recurring cash flow for distribution supplemented by capital growth over time. Our business is predominantly focused on prime office properties located in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France. These are not only the largest economies in Europe, but the largest, most established, liquid and among the most stable office markets in Europe. We seek to utilize our established local networks to source suitable investment opportunities. We have a long term investment approach and expect to make equity investments, directly or indirectly through joint ventures.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor recent accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our business, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nThe following presents a summary of our activity for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2017 represents our results of operations which includes the disposal of six assets for net proceeds of $132.5 million and our preferred equity investment of $35.3 million (\u00a326.2 million). \n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2016 represents our results of operations for the first full year of activity as a stand-alone company. During 2016, we disposed of 18 assets for net proceeds of $406.9 million. \n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2015 represents: (i) our results of operations following the Spin-off and two months of activity as a stand-alone company; and (ii) our results of operations of the European Real Estate Business as if the transferred business was the business for the periods in which common control was present and an allocation of costs related to us for the period from January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2015. We acquired 49 assets across nine countries in April 2015 and Trianon Tower in July 2015. In December 2015, we disposed of three assets for net proceeds of $21.0 million.  Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n\nRevenues\nRental Income\nRental income consists of rental revenue in our real estate equity segment. Rental income decreased $19.0 million, primarily due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016.\nEscalation Income\nEscalation income consists of tenant recoveries in our real estate equity segment. Escalation income decreased $3.5 million, primarily due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016 and the timing of certain recoverable expenses. There is a corresponding decrease in properties - operating expenses and a majority of these costs are recovered from our tenants.\nInterest Income\nInterest income relates to our preferred equity investment originated in the second quarter 2017 in our preferred equity segment.\nOther Income\nOther income is principally related to lease surrender premiums, insurance refunds and termination fees in our real estate equity segment. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2017 predominantly represents lease surrender premium payments. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2016 represents early termination of two tenants whose spaces were subsequently re-let.\nExpenses\nProperties - Operating Expenses\nProperties - operating expenses decreased $4.8 million due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016 partially offset by a straight-line rent write-off related to an early tenant termination at Portman Square in connection with the Invesco expansion. There is a corresponding decrease in escalation income and a majority of these costs are recovered from our tenants.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $15.6 million due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016 and corresponding repayments of certain mortgage notes and due to the refinancing of certain mortgage notes in our real estate equity segment in the third quarter 2017 and the repayment of our senior stock-settlable notes in our corporate segment in 2016.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily related to costs associated with amending the management agreement in our corporate segment and other acquisition costs in our preferred equity segment. In addition, a transaction fee was paid to a third party and reimbursed in total by the entity that originated our preferred equity investment resulting in no impact to transaction costs. Transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily related to costs associated with exploring potential transactions and the Mergers in our corporate segment.\nImpairment losses\nImpairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to impairment of one of our held-for-sale assets in our real estate equity segment, which sold in 2016 for less than the initial carrying value. The initial carrying value was based on the initial purchase price allocation of the asset, which utilized different assumptions than the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation, primarily being a longer holding period. The sale price of the asset was in line with the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation.\nManagement Fee, Related Party\nManagement fee, related party relates to the management fee incurred to our Manager in our corporate segment (refer to Related Parties Arrangements\u201d below for more information).\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses primarily represent third-party service provider fees such as asset management, accounting, tax, legal fees and other compliance related fees related to portfolio management of our real estate equity segment. The decrease of $3.1 million is due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016 partially offset by one time fees associated with the termination of certain third-party property accountants.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses including external and internal audit, legal fees and other corporate expenses are incurred in our corporate segment. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our Manager did not allocate any general and administrative expenses to us. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our Manager allocated $0.2 million.\nCompensation Expense\nCompensation expense is comprised of non-cash amortization of time-based, market-based and performance-based awards in our corporate segment. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017, is mainly due to the acceleration of a material portion of our time-based equity awards due to the Mergers which occurred in the first quarter of 2017. Refer to Note 7 Compensation Expense\u201d and Note 8 Stockholders' Equity\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further information.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased due to the disposal of 24 properties during 2017 and 2016 in our real estate equity segment partially, offset by the write-off of intangibles due to lease terminations in the third quarter 2017.\nOther Income (Loss)\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Derivatives and Other\nUnrealized gain (loss) on derivatives and other is primarily related to the non-cash change in fair value of derivative instruments. The loss related to foreign currency forwards used to hedge projected net property level cash flows in our corporate segment was primarily due to the strengthened Euro against the U.S. dollar. The decrease in the loss related to the interest rate caps in our real estate equity segment is due to the movement in European interest rate in 2017 compared to 2016.\nThe following table presents a summary of unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives and other for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Sales and Other\nThe following table presents a summary of realized gain (loss) on sales and other for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n\n_____________\n (1) Excludes subsequent sale costs relating to 2016 sales and escrow arrangements entered into for specific indemnification obligations in relation to the sales. \n (2) Includes $(1.4) million and $17.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, relating to the reclassification of the currency translation adjustment from a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, or OCI, to realized gain due to the sale of certain real estate assets. \n (3) Includes the write-off of deferred financing costs due to the repayment of certain mortgage and other notes payable and subsequent costs relating to 2016 sales offset by the release of certain escrow arrangements for specific indemnification obligations in relation to the sales.  Income Tax Benefit (Expense)\nThe income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 represents a net benefit of $2.1 million related to our real estate equity segment. The income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 represents a net expense of $2.7 million primarily related to the capital gain on the sale of real estate investments in our real estate equity segment.\nSame Store Analysis\nThe following table presents our same store analysis for the real estate equity segment which represents 25 properties (323,230 square meters) and excludes properties that were acquired or sold at any time during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n\n__________________\n (1) Three months ended December 31, 2016 is translated using the average exchange rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017. \n (2) Adjusted to exclude amortization of above/below market leases and ground leases. \n (3) We believe same store net operating income, a non-GAAP metric, is a useful metric of the operating performance as it reflects the operating performance of the real estate portfolio excluding effects of non-cash adjustments and provides a better measure of operational performance for a quarter-over-quarter comparison. Same store net operating income is presented for the same store portfolio, which represents all properties that were owned by us in the end of the reporting period. We define same store net operating income as NOI excluding (i) properties that were acquired or sold during the period, (ii) impact of foreign currency changes and (iii) amortization of above/below market leases. We consider same store net operating income to be an appropriate and useful supplemental performance measure. Same store net operating income should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, our methodology for calculating same store net operating income involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies. Refer below for a reconciliation of same store NOI to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Same Store Revenue\nSame store rental income increased driven primarily by recent leasing activity and rent reviews completed during the year including Deutsche Bundesbank commencing occupation in the Trianon Tower (completed in January 2018). Same store other income decreased due to one-time early termination premiums in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSame Store Expense\nSame store properties - operating expenses decreased due to lower repairs and maintenance partially offset by the timing of certain recoverable expenses and a straight-line rent write-off related to an early tenant termination at Portman Square in connection with the Invesco expansion.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Same Store\nThe following table presents a reconciliation from net income (loss) to same store net operating income for the real estate equity segment for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\n\n__________________\n (1) Includes management fees, general and administrative expense, compensation expense, corporate interest expense and corporate transaction costs. \n (2) Includes depreciation and amortization expense, unrealized loss on interest rate caps, and other expenses in the real estate equity segment. \n (3) Represents the impact of assets sold during the period. \n (4) Represents interest income earned in the preferred equity segment. \n (5) Three months ended December 31, 2016 is translated using the average exchange rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017.  Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):\n\nRevenues\nRental Income\nRental income consists of rental revenue in our real estate equity segment. Rental income increased $23.3 million, primarily due to 2016 being the first full year since acquisition and leases signed in 2016 partially offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016 and the vacancy of a tenant in the Trianon Tower in the fourth quarter 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 27,000 square meters of leases were signed and renegotiated in our real estate equity segment generating a revenue increase of $5 million.\nEscalation Income\nEscalation income consists of tenant recoveries in our real estate equity segment. Escalation income increased $6.4 million, primarily due to 2016 being the first full year since acquisition, leases signed in 2016 resulting in higher recoverability partially offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016. There is a corresponding increase in properties operating expenses and a majority of these costs are recoverable from the tenants.\nOther Income\nOther income is principally related to lease termination fees in our real estate equity segment. Other revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the early termination of two tenants whose spaces were subsequently re-let.\nExpenses\nProperties - Operating Expenses\nProperties - operating expenses increased $9.3 million due to 2016 being the first full year of since acquisition partially offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016. There is a corresponding increase in escalation income and a majority of these costs are recovered from our tenants.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $5.3 million due to 2016 being the first full year since acquisition and financing partially offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016 and the refinancing of certain mortgage notes in our real estate equity segment.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relate to costs associated with exploring potential transactions in our real estate equity segment and costs related to the Mergers in our corporate segment.

The initial carrying value was based on the initial purchase price allocation of the asset, which utilized different assumptions than the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation, primarily being a longer holding period. The sale price of the asset was in line with the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation. Impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to impairment of goodwill on one reporting unit which management deemed to be impaired in our real estate equity segment.\nManagement Fee, Related Party\nManagement fee, related party relates to the management fee incurred to our Manager in our corporate segment (refer to Related Parties Arrangements\u201d below for more information). The management contract with our Manager commenced on November 1, 2015.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses primarily represent third-party service provider fees such as audit and legal fees and other compliance related fees related to portfolio management of our real estate equity segment. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to the full year impact of owning and managing the properties acquired in 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses are principally incurred in our corporate segment. The year ended December 31, 2016 represented a full year of operating as a stand-alone company, which included professional fees such as audit, internal audit, legal and other public company costs and includes an allocation of general and administrative expenses from our Manager of $0.2 million.

We began to incur compensation expense upon the Spin-off in November 2015. The year ended December 31, 2016 changes do not take into account the impact of the vesting as a result of the Mergers (refer to Item 8 Compensation Expense\u201d for more information).\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased due to 2016 being the first full year of ownership partially offset by the disposals of 18 properties during 2016 and assets being reclassified into held for sale in our real estate equity segment.\nOther Income (Loss)\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nUnrealized gain (loss) on investments and other is primarily related to the non-cash change in fair value of derivative instruments. The increase in the foreign currency forwards was decreased by the strengthened U.S. dollar against the U.K. Pound Sterling and the Euro. The decrease on the interest rate caps relates to the movement in European interests rates.\nThe following table presents a summary of unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):\n\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nThe following table presents a summary of realized gain (loss) on investments and other for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):\n\n_____________\n (1) Excludes escrow arrangements entered into for specific warranties in relation to the sales. \n (2) Includes $17.7 million relating to the reclassification of the currency translation adjustment from a component of accumulated OCI to realized gain (losses) due to the sale of certain real estate assets, offset by the realized loss on the repayment of the intercompany loans in different currencies. \n (3) Includes the write-off of deferred financing costs due to the repayment of certain mortgage and other notes payable in the real estate equity segment and our senior stock-settlable notes repurchases in the corporate segment.  Income Tax Benefit (Expense)\nThe income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 represents a net expense of $2.7 million primarily related to the capital gain on the sale of real estate investments in our real estate equity segment. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 represents a net benefit of $0.7 million primarily related to deferred tax benefits in our real estate equity segment.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur financing strategy is to employ investment-level financing to prudently leverage our investments and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders through a wide range of secured and unsecured debt and public and private equity capital sources to fund our investment activities. In addition to investment-specific financings, we may use and have used credit facilities and repaid facilities on a shorter term basis and public and private, secured and unsecured debt issuances on a longer term basis. Our current primary liquidity needs are to fund:\n \u2022 our operating expenses and investment activities; \n \u2022 acquisitions of our target assets and related ongoing commitments; \n \u2022 capital improvements \n \u2022 distributions to our stockholders; \n \u2022 principal and interest payments on our borrowings; and \n \u2022 income tax liabilities of taxable REIT subsidiaries and we are subject to limitations as a REIT.  Our current primary sources of liquidity are:\n \u2022 cash flow generated from our investments, both from operations and return of capital \n \u2022 net proceeds from asset disposals; \n \u2022 financings secured by our assets such as mortgage notes, longer term senior and subordinate corporate capital such as revolving credit facilities; and \n \u2022 cash on hand.  We seek to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, including the repayment of borrowings and our investment funding needs, through existing cash resources, issuance of debt or equity capital, return of capital from investments and the liquidation or refinancing of assets. Nonetheless, our ability to meet a long-term (beyond one year) liquidity requirement may be subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing. Any decision by our lenders and investors to provide us with financing will depend upon a number of factors, such as our compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements, our financial performance, industry or market trends, the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions, such lenders' and investors' resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities.\nAs a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders, including taxable income where we do not receive corresponding cash, and we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and to avoid federal income tax and the non-deductible excise tax. On a quarterly basis, our Board determines an appropriate common stock dividend based upon numerous factors, including CAD, REIT qualification requirements, availability of existing cash balances, borrowing capacity under existing credit agreements, access to cash in the capital markets and other financing sources, our view of our ability to realize gains in the future through appreciation in the value of our assets, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impact our business or prospects. Future dividend levels are subject to adjustment based upon our evaluation of the factors described above, as well as other factors that our Board may, from time-to-time, deem relevant to consider when determining an appropriate common stock dividend.\nIn November 2015, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock. That authorization expired in November 2016 and at such time the Board authorized an additional repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock through November 2017. In March 2018, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization expires in March 2019, unless otherwise extended by our board of directors. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 5.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $58.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 3.6 million shares of our common stock for approximately $41.4 million. From the original authorization in November 2015 through December 31, 2017, we repurchased 9.3 million shares of its common stock for approximately $100.0 million.\nIn April 2017, we amended and restated our revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility, with a commitment of $35 million and with an initial two year term. The Credit Facility no longer contains a limitation on availability based on a borrowing base and the interest rate remains the same.\nIn March 2018, we amended the Credit Facility, increasing the size to $70 million and extending the term until April 2020 with one year extension option. The Credit Facility includes an accordion feature, providing for the ability to increase the facility to $105 million.\nIn June 2017, we amended and restated the Trias mortgage note agreement to increase the loan amount by $5.9 million and reduce future minimum capital expenditure spending requirements. In September 2017, we amended and restated the financing terms for $568 million of the SEB mortgage note agreement to reduce the margin from 1.80% to 1.55% and extended the maturity date from April 1, 2022 to July 20, 2024.\nWe believe that our existing sources of funds should be adequate for purposes of meeting our short-term liquidity needs. We expect our contractual rental income to be sufficient to meet our expected capital expenditures, interest expense, property operating and general and administrative expenses as well as common dividends declared by us. We may seek to raise additional capital in order to finance new acquisitions. Unrestricted cash as of March 9, 2018 was approximately $62 million and $70 million of availability under the Credit Facility.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our activity for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2017 represents our results of operations which includes the disposal of six assets and our preferred equity investment of $35.3 million (\u00a326.2 million). \n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2016 represents our results of operations for the first full year of activity as a stand-alone company.

The annualized fee for payable to our Manager in 2018 based on the Amended and Restated Management Agreement (refer below) is approximately $16.6 million as of December 31, 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRelated Party Arrangements\nColony NorthStar, Inc.\nOn November 9, 2017, we entered into an amended and restated management agreement, or the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, with CNI NRE Advisors, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (unless the context requires otherwise, together with its affiliates, the Asset Manager\u201d), an affiliate of Colony NorthStar, effective as of January 1, 2018. The description of the management agreement included below relates to the Amended and Restated Management Agreement. Refer to Note 6 Related Party Arrangements\u201d in our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a description of the terms of the original agreement that was entered into in November 2015 and which was superseded as of January 1, 2018 by the Amended and Restated Management Agreement.\nManagement Agreement Amendment\nUnder the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, the Asset Manager is generally responsible to manage our day to day operations, subject to the supervision and management of our Board. The Asset Manager is required to provide us with a management team and other appropriate employees and resources necessary to manage us.\nTerm; Renewals\nThe Amended and Restated Management Agreement provides for an initial term (beginning January 1, 2018) of five years, or the Initial Term, with subsequent automatic renewals for additional three-year terms, unless either party provides notice to the other party of its intention to decline to renew the agreement at least six months prior to the expiration of the then-current term. During the Initial Term, the Amended and Restated Management Agreement is terminable only for cause (as described in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement).\nIf we elect not to renew the Amended and Restated Management Agreement at the end of a term, we will be obligated to pay the Asset Manager a termination fee, or the Termination Fee, equal to three times the amount of the base management fees earned by the Asset Manager over the four most recent quarters immediately preceding the non-renewal. In addition, if at any time after the Initial Term, we undergo a change of control\u201d (as defined in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement), we may elect to terminate the agreement but upon any such termination it will be obligated to pay the Termination Fee to the Asset Manager.\nAssignment\nThe Amended and Restated Management Agreement provides that in the event of a change of control of the Asset Manager or other event that could be deemed an assignment of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, we will consider such assignment in good faith and not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay our consent. The Amended and Restated Management Agreement further provides that we anticipate consent would be granted for an assignment or deemed assignment to a party with expertise in commercial real estate and over $10 billion of assets under management. The Amended and Restated Management Agreement also provides that, notwithstanding anything in the agreement to the contrary, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, rules and regulations, in connection with any merger, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, change of control, reorganization, consolidation or any similar transaction by us or the Asset Manager, directly or indirectly, the surviving entity will succeed to the terms of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement.\nBase Management Fee\nPursuant to the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, beginning January 1, 2018, we are obligated to pay, quarterly, in arrears, in cash, the Asset Manager a base management fee per annum equal to:\n \u2022 1.50% of our reported EPRA NAV (as defined in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement) for EPRA NAV amounts up to and including $2.0 billion; plus \n \u2022 1.25% of our reported EPRA NAV on any EPRA NAV amount exceeding $2.0 billion.  EPRA NAV is based on a U.S. GAAP balance sheet adjusted based on our interpretation of the European Public Real Estate Association, or EPRA, guidelines, and similar as prior practices, including adjustments such as fair value of operating real estate, straight-line rent and deferred taxes and additional adjustments to be determined by us in good faith based on any changes to U.S. GAAP, international accounting standards or EPRA guidelines. In calculating EPRA NAV, the liquidation preference of preferred securities outstanding shall not be included as a liability of us and shall not reduce EPRA NAV.\nIncentive Fee\nIn addition to the base management fees, we are obligated to pay the Asset Manager an incentive fee, if any, or the Incentive Fee, with respect to each measurement period equal to twenty percent (20%) of: (i) the excess of (a) our Total Stockholder Return (as defined in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, which includes stock price appreciation and dividends received and is subject to a high watermark price established when a prior incentive fee is realized) for the relevant measurement period above (b) a 10% cumulative annual hurdle rate, multiplied by (ii) our Weighted Average Shares (as defined in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement) during the measurement period. The first measurement period for the incentive fee will begin January 1, 2018 and end on December 31 of the applicable calendar year and subsequent measurement periods will begin on January 1 of the subsequent calendar year. Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4(d) of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement for common stock payments, we may elect to pay the Incentive Fee, if any, in cash or in shares of restricted common stock or shares of unrestricted common stock repurchased by us in the open market or a combination thereof. Any shares of common stock delivered by us will be subject to lock-up restrictions that will be released in equal one-third increments on each anniversary of the end of the measurement period with respect to which such incentive fee was earned. In calculating the value of the shares of our common stock paid in satisfaction of the Incentive Fee obligation, the shares of restricted common stock will be valued at the higher of: (i) the volume weighted average trading price per share for the ten consecutive trading days (as defined in the Amended and Restated Management Agreement) ending on the trading day prior to the date the payment is due and (ii) our EPRA NAV per share, based on our most recently published EPRA NAV and the Weighted Average Shares as of the end of the period with respect to which such EPRA NAV was published.\nCosts and Expenses\nWe are responsible to pay (or reimburse the Asset Manager) for all of our direct, out of pocket costs and expenses as a stand alone company incurred by or on behalf of us and our subsidiaries, all of which must be reasonable, customary and documented. Internalized Service Costs (as defined below) are not intended to be covered costs and expenses under this provision and are subject to the limits described in the next paragraph.\nIn addition to the expenses described in the prior paragraph, for each calendar quarter, beginning with the first quarter of 2018, we are obligated to reimburse the Asset Manager for (i) all direct, reasonable, customary and documented costs and expenses incurred by the Asset Manager for salaries, wages, bonuses, payroll taxes and employee benefits for personnel employed by the Asset Manager: (a) who solely provide services to us which prior to January 1, 2018 were provided by unaffiliated third parties, including accounting and treasury services or (b) who were hired by the Asset Manager after January 1, 2018 but who solely provide services to us in respect of one of the categories of services previously internalized pursuant to clause (a) and who were not hired in connection with any event which otherwise resulted in an increase to our net asset value (such costs and expenses set forth in clauses (i) and (ii), the Internalized Service Costs\u201d), plus (ii) 20% of the amount calculated under clause (i) to cover\nreasonable overhead charges with respect to such personnel, provided that we shall not be obligated to reimburse the Asset Manager for such costs and expenses to the extent they exceed the following quarterly limits:\n \u2022 0.0375% of our aggregate gross asset value as of the end of the prior calendar quarter (excluding cash and cash equivalents and certain other exclusions) as calculated for purposes of determining EPRA NAV, or GAV, for GAV amounts to and including $2.5 billion, plus \n \u2022 0.0313% of GAV amounts between $2.5 billion and $5.0 billion, plus \n \u2022 0.025% of GAV amounts exceeding $5.0 billion.  If the Asset Manager's actual Internalized Service Costs during any quarter exceed the quarterly limit described in the preceding paragraph (the cumulative excess amounts, if any, in respect of each quarter during a calendar year, is referred to as the Quarterly Cap Excess Amount we are obligated to reimburse the Asset Manager on an annual basis for an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Quarterly Cap Excess Amount and (ii) the sum of the amounts, if any, determined for each quarter within such calendar year by which Internalized Services Costs in respect of such quarter were less than the quarterly limits described in the prior paragraph.\nEquity Based Compensation\nIn addition, we expect to make annual equity compensation grants to our management and other employees of the Asset Manager, provided that the aggregate annual grant amount, type and other terms of such equity compensation must be approved by our compensation committee. The Asset Manager will have discretion in allocating the aggregate grant among our management and other employees of the Asset Manager.\nUnder the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, beginning with our 2018 annual stockholders' meeting, the Asset Manager will have the right to nominate one director (who is expected to be one of our current directors employed by the Asset Manager) to our board of directors.\nTransaction Expenses\nWe agreed to pay for up to $2.5 million of fees and expenses payable by the Asset Manager to its external financial advisors in connection with the negotiation and execution of the Amended and Restated Management Agreement.\nColony NorthStar Ownership Waiver and Voting Agreement\nIn connection with the entry into the Amended and Restated Management Agreement, we provided Colony NorthStar with an ownership waiver under our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, allowing Colony NorthStar to purchase up to 45% of our stock. The waiver provides that if the Amended and Restated Management Agreement is terminated, Colony NorthStar may not purchase any shares of our common stock to the extent Colony NorthStar owns (or would own as a result of such purchase) more than 9.8% of our capital stock. In connection with the waiver, Colony NorthStar also agreed that for all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, to the extent Colony NorthStar owns more than 25% of our common stock (such shares owned by Colony NorthStar in excess of the 25% threshold, refer to as the Excess Shares, it will vote the Excess Shares in the same proportion that our remaining shares not owned by Colony NorthStar or its affiliates are voted. If the Amended and Restated Management Agreement is terminated, then beginning on the third anniversary of such termination, the threshold described in the prior sentence will be reduced from 25% to 9.8%.\nManager Ownership of Common Stock\nAs of December 31, 2017, Colony NorthStar and its subsidiaries owned 5.6 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 10.2% of the total outstanding common stock.\nRecent Developments\nDividends\nOn March 7, 2018, we declared a dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock. The common stock dividend will be paid on March 23, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2018.\nShare Repurchase\nIn March 2018, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock. The authorization expires in March 2019, unless otherwise extended by our board of directors.\nDisposals\nIn February 2018, we agreed a definitive sale and purchase agreement to sell the Maastoren property, our largest non-core asset, for approximately $190 million. We expect to release approximately $60 million of net equity after repayment of financing (including release premium) and transaction costs.\nCredit Facility\nIn March 2018, we amended the Credit Facility, increasing the size to $70 million and extending the term until April 2020 with one year extension option. The Credit Facility includes an accordion feature, providing for the ability to increase the facility to $105 million.\nInflation\nVirtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other factors influence our performance significantly more than inflation does. A change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates may correlate with changes in inflation rates. With the exception of the United Kingdom, rent is generally adjusted annually based on local consumer price indices. In the United Kingdom, rent is typically subject to an upward only rent review approximately every three to five years.\nRefer to", "item_7_tables": "Table 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>

provides an analysis of the financial standing and performance of NorthStar Realty Europe Corp. (referred to as \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") and should be read alongside the consolidated financial statements and notes. The company primarily invests in European real estate, particularly prime office properties in major cities within Germany, the United Kingdom, and France. Key financial measures used to assess profitability and performance include Cash Available for Distribution (CAD) and Net Operating Income (NOI).\n\nThe European economy experienced its fastest growth in a decade in 2017, driven by strong global economic performance, European exports, corporate profits, and surges in confidence and investment levels. Despite political uncertainties, the investment climate was generally positive, except for a slowdown in the UK economy due to Brexit-related challenges.\n\nWe have a stable and recurring cash flow from rental and other property-related income, aiming for capital growth over time. The financial results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 are summarized, highlighting operations, revenue changes due to property disposals, and various income sources. A decrease in rental income and escalation income was reported for 2017 due to the disposal of properties, while interest income saw a significant increase due to a new preferred equity investment.\n\nExpenses for properties also declined, primarily from disposals and write-offs associated with tenant terminations. Transaction costs and interest expenses decreased, management fees slightly increased, while general and administrative expenses decreased. Compensation expense increased, notably because of equity award accelerations due to Mergers.\n\nThe outlook for 2018 includes several large transactions and positive pressure on rents, especially in Germany and Central London due to strong demand for office properties. The company's strategy focuses on long-term equity investments, particularly in flagship office markets.\n\nWe adhere to U.S. GAAP but provide certain non-GAAP financial measures for additional perspective. Recent changes to accounting policies have potential implications for our financials.\n\nLiquidity needs include operating expenses, asset acquisitions, capital improvements, shareholder distribution, debt servicing, and taxes. Primary sources include investment cash flows, asset disposal proceeds, financing, and cash on hand. We have a stated policy of distributing most of our REIT taxable income to avoid federal income tax and excise tax.\n\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017, are largely composed of mortgage and other notes payable, with significant amounts due more than five years from now.\n\nThe report includes details about our Amended and Restated Management Agreement with CNI NRE Advisors, LLC beginning January 1, 2018. Key points include fees, services provision, term and renewal conditions, compensation, termination implications, and changes in control provisions.\n\nLastly, recent developments detailed in the report include a dividend declaration, a share repurchase authorization, a signed agreement to sell a non-core property, an amended Credit Facility, and notes on the impact of inflation, which is less significant for us compared to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations."}
