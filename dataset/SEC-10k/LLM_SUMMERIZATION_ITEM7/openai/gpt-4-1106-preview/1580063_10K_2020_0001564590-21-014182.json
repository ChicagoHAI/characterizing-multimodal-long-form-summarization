Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those described in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview and Recent Developments\nWe are a biotechnology company with an established track record of success in developing and commercializing molecular testing products as well as innovating in the field of precision medicine. We believe that we are a market-leading provider of in vitro molecular tests designed to improve lives by providing actionable information that helps guide patients and physicians in making critical and timely medical decisions during various life stages, such as family planning, pregnancy, or navigating a complex disease diagnosis. Our vision is to transform healthcare to become more precise and personal by improving diagnoses of disease and improving patient outcomes through localized treatment with targeted therapies. We apply a multi-omics approach, combining genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, to our molecular testing products and to the development of a suite of investigational ingestible devices and drug/device combinations designed to provide precise diagnostic sampling and drug delivery solutions.\nOur internal core competencies, deep research and development pipeline and strategic acquisitions of novel technologies have fueled our innovation in women's health, supporting the development and launch of complementary molecular testing products that inform critical healthcare decision-making across a woman's lifetime.\nIn 2015, we launched both our Innatal Prenatal Screen, a Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing, or NIPT, offering, and our Preparent Carrier Test, followed by the launch of our Riscover Hereditary Cancer Test in 2017. We offer molecular tests with market-leading performance and turnaround times, supported by end-to-end workflow solutions that increase administrative efficiencies. Along with our comprehensive menu of molecular tests, we offer patients pre-test education, clear and timely results, and on-demand genetic counseling. We are committed to providing patients and physicians with empathetic communication and support during critical moments to help empower and prepare patients and their families to make critical life decisions.\nWe generate revenue by providing tests. Our molecular tests are provided through our certified Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, and College of American Pathologists, or CAP, accredited laboratory located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We also provide anatomic and molecular pathology tests through our affiliation with Mattison Pathology, LLP, a Texas limited liability partnership doing business as Avero Diagnostics, located in Lubbock and Irving, Texas. The focus of our commercial operations is to distribute our molecular tests and our anatomic and molecular pathology tests through our dedicated direct sales force. Distribution of our tests is supported by a field operations team who provide all logistical functions in receiving clinical samples at the laboratory for analysis. In the second quarter of 2020, we added COVID-19 testing to our offering and began offering COVID-19 testing nationally in mid-November 2020. Future demand for COVID-19 testing is becoming increasing difficult to predict due to various factors, including but not limited to, the availability of vaccinations, the number of individuals who choose to be vaccinated, the effectiveness of the various vaccinations against variants, the rate of new cases, and evolving government directives, laws, regulations and rules related to COVID-19 testing. In the long term, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will eventually dissipate and, as a result, the significance of COVID-19 testing to our business and financial results will decrease.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we accessioned approximately 320,000 and 329,000 tests, respectively.\nWe generate revenue through providing our tests and receiving payments for such tests from payors, laboratory distribution partners, and self-paying individuals. More than 95% of payments for our tests are received through reimbursement. We receive reimbursement from several distinct channels: commercial third-party payors, laboratory distribution partners, and government health benefits programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nWe are engaged in research and development activities with respect to molecular tests and precision medicine product candidates. Our molecular test portfolio and pipeline and our precision medicine product pipeline are each powered by a combination of symbiotic technology platforms exploiting advances in genetics, epigenetics, and proteomics, fortified by an innovative bioinformatics infrastructure. Our ecosystem is designed to enable rapid development and validation of products in an integrated fashion. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development activities as a public company. As a result, we expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may need to raise additional capital in order to fund our operations. Our ability to return to profitability will depend upon achieving our revenue growth objectives and successfully managing our costs.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we successfully achieved a key milestone in the verification phase of our rule out assay for preeclampsia and held a preeclampsia research and development day.\nIn February 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement for a private placement with certain institutional and accredited investors, or the Purchasers. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers purchased an aggregate of 4,370,629 units, or the Units, representing (i) 4,370,629 shares of our common stock and (ii) warrants to purchase up to 4,370,629 shares of common stock. The purchase price for each Unit was $5.72, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $25.0 million. The warrants are exercisable for cash at an exercise price of $6.86 per share, subject to adjustments as provided under the terms of the warrants. The warrants are immediately exercisable for cash and expire on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance. If exercised for cash, the warrants would result in additional gross proceeds to us of approximately $30.0 million.\nIn December 2020, we issued and sold 8,792,047 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering, at a price of $3.27 per share. We received approximately $26.9 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn December 2020, in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, we issued a total of $168.5 million principal amount of our Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture, dated as of December 7, 2020, by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, or the Indenture. The Convertible Notes are due on December 1, 2025, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted, and accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to 7.25% payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, with the initial payment on June 1, 2021.\nIn November 2020, we approved a reduction in force that resulted in the termination of approximately 9.5% of our workforce, or approximately 67 employees. The reduction in force was implemented in order to enable us to decrease its costs and more effectively align resources to business priorities. The reduction in force was a component of our broader efforts to materially reduce our research and development expenses by focusing on key milestones and to limit progression of other costs to track our top line performance.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe there are several important factors that impact our commercial performance and results of operations, including:\nReport Volume\nWe compete in the molecular testing market based upon several factors, including (i) the strong performance and short turnaround time of our integrated tests, (ii) the quality of our sales and marketing efforts with physicians, (iii) the quality of our end-to-end customer service and support solutions, and (iv) the availability of reimbursement for our tests. Our commercial team of more than 150 individuals actively engages with physicians and their staff to emphasize the clinical need for our products, provide education on the clinical value of our products, and facilitate the ability of physicians and their staff to order our tests. The volume of tests that we accession is one of the key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. A test is accessioned when we receive the test samples at our laboratory, the relevant information about the desired test is entered into our systems, and the samples are routed into the appropriate process flow. The historical ratio of the Innatal tests and the Preparent tests that we accession is approximately 1.2:1. As the types and categories of tests that are covered by reimbursement increase or decrease, the volume of testing may correspondingly increase or decrease, respectively. In 2019, we conducted a comprehensive review of our existing accounts and sought to eliminate accounts that did not contribute to our revenues and our gross margin. Our test volumes decreased partly as a result of this exercise.\nBeginning in March 2020, we began to observe declines in the volumes of both our molecular tests and the pathology tests conducted by Avero Diagnostics due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state and local governments. However, we believe our business is resilient and we observed positive signs of recovery in the second half of 2020. While we have implemented and continue to monitor our mitigation strategies to address these limitations, such as supporting patients and physicians virtually and offering COVID-19 PCR testing, there can be no assurance that the rate of decline in our testing volumes will not continue or accelerate in future periods. Our current assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is that our NIPT test volumes have proved more resilient than our carrier screening test volumes; however, the comparative impact may continue to change over time.\nReimbursement\nReimbursement fluctuations may occur due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\nTable 332: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> third-party payor coverage and, as we continually seek to transition to in-network coverage with commercial third-party payors, corresponding increases in our in-network covered lives;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 333: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> regulatory and medical society recommendations such as CMS, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG, ACMG, and SMFM, that potentially lead to positive coverage determinations by commercial third-party payors and government health benefits programs for our tests;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 334: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> third-party payor medical coverage and administrative policies, including reimbursement rates published by CMS;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 335: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> delays to third-party payors' processing due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 336: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> future CPT code and medical procedure code changes, such as obtaining appropriate codes for our new molecular tests, including our expanded carrier screening panels, NIPT, and Exon carrier screening;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 337: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> regulatory and payor fee schedule changes for CPT codes with respect to our products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 338: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> requirements to refund any reimbursements already received;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 339: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the overall mix of payor class for our products sold;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 340: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changes in physician ordering trends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 341: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the mix of our products sold;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 342: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the geographic regions in which our products are sold;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 343: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> competition in our industries and any change in the competitive landscape of our industries, including potential consolidation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 344: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Margin\nOur gross margin is an important indicator of the operating performance of our business. Higher gross margins reflect the average selling price of our tests, as well as the operating efficiency of our laboratory operations. Reducing the costs of goods sold for our tests represents another important opportunity for innovation and is a significant area of focus for our research and development organization. We regularly evaluate our operations in order to determine whether we can reduce costs by developing new technologies, improving the efficiency of our assay and laboratory processes, modifying our processes to use materials and technologies that provide equal or greater quality at lower cost, and improving how we manage our inventory and negotiating favorable terms for our materials purchases. We are currently developing our next generation Innatal Prenatal Screen (Innatal 4th Generation), an improved platform with simplified and more cost-effective assay workflow, which we believe will allow us to substantially improve the gross margin of our NIPT. We also work with partner laboratories that complement our test portfolio offering, while developing in parallel new technologies that we expect could, over time, reduce our cost structure by internalizing the production of those tests when the commercial benefits dictate such conversion. We are now predominantly an in-network provider, with approximately 146 million covered lives nationwide under our agreements with commercial third-party payors following the recent additions of in-network contracts with Aetna and Cigna. While we continue our contract negotiation process with several additional large commercial third-party payors, the transition to establishing ourselves as an in-network provider is expected to lead to an increase in the proportion of tests paid and allow us to gain access to a larger in-network patient base.\nNew Product Development\nOur business involves significant investment in research and development activities for the development of new products which we believe are strategic complements to our product portfolio and drive long-term revenue growth. We intend to continue investing in our pipeline of new products and technologies. We expect our investment in research and development to increase as we pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates and as we seek to expand our pipeline of product candidates. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments, certain of our research and development activities have been delayed and may be further delayed until such operational limitations are lifted. While we are implementing mitigation strategies, where possible, certain preclinical and clinical activities were suspended during the implementation of these policies and will necessarily incur some delay following the resumption of normal operations. While some of our research and development laboratory work was impacted by the stay-at-home shutdown, especially in\nour Michigan facilities, our preeclampsia test verification work restarted in June and has now migrated to the operations laboratory, which is part of our essential services, and is, therefore, less exposed to further shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the development of our new products could continue to be delayed if any stay-at-home orders in the State of Michigan are reinstated.\nThe achievement of key development milestones (e.g., clinical verification and validation and CLIA certification for our molecular tests and clinical studies and regulatory approval for our precision medicine product platform) is a key factor in evaluating our performance.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations.\nRevenue\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from molecular laboratory tests, principally from the sale of Innatal, Preparent, and pathology molecular testing. Historically, the revenue we derive from our Innatal tests and our Preparent tests has been roughly equal, although the ratio fluctuates from time to time. We bill and collect from third-party payors, laboratory distribution partners, and self-paying individuals. Third-party payors include commercial third-party payors and government payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States. We bill for these tests rendered upon completion of the testing process and delivery of test results to the customer.\nDue to potential future changes in insurance coverage policies, contractual rates, and other trends in the reimbursement of our tests, payments received for our tests may fluctuate significantly over time. Our revenue incorporates an estimate of variable consideration, which is adjusted for estimates of disallowed cases, discounts, and refunds. We have established an accrual for refunds of payments previously made by healthcare insurers based on historical experience and executed settlement agreements with healthcare insurers. The refunds are accounted for as reductions in revenues in the statement of operations as an element of variable consideration. Our estimate of variable consideration included in the transaction price is also impacted by our ongoing transition to in-network contracts with commercial payors.\nCurrently, we operate primarily as an in-network provider of molecular tests and we continually seek to transition to in-network coverage with additional third-party payors, which we believe is crucial to our growth and long-term success. This transition is ongoing, and we are actively negotiating with a few remaining commercial payors. We are currently contracted with payors representing an estimated 146 million covered lives.\nWhile the negotiated fees under our in-network contracts with third-party payors are typically lower than the out-of-network list price of our tests, the percentage of tests allowed by payors under in-network contracts traditionally increases in accordance with payors' medical or administrative policies. While we expect the reduction in average reimbursement per test from in-network pricing to reduce our per test revenue and gross margins in the near term, in-network pricing is more predictable than out-of-network pricing, and we intend to continue to mitigate the impact by implementing a strategic focus for our most profitable accounts.\nDelays to third-party payors' processing due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments have and may continue to extend the typical timelines. These factors might delay the time period in which cash is collected from payors and impact our revenue recognition. We believe that the full impact of these delays may not yet have been reflected in our financial performance, as we customarily receive payment several months after completion of a molecular test.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales includes the cost of materials, direct labor of laboratory personnel, third-party laboratory testing services, equipment, and infrastructure expenses associated with processing blood and other samples, quality control analyses, shipping charges to transport samples and specimens from ordering physicians, clinics, or individuals, and allocated overhead, including information technology, or IT, costs. Infrastructure expenses include allocated facility and related occupancy costs. Costs associated with the performance of molecular tests are recorded as tests are processed. We have implemented and continue to monitor mitigation strategies to address the work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While largely yet to be determined, these mitigation strategies may cause increases in any or all of the aforementioned costs. The amount of cost of sales is related to our volume of accessioned tests, which is directly related to consumption of reagents and other laboratory support services. Therefore, growth in accessioned volume of tests results in increased cost of sales on an aggregate basis and potential modest reductions in cost of sales on a per-test basis.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with performing research and development activities to improve our tests, to reduce product costs, and to develop new products including our preeclampsia test and our precision medicine product candidates. Research and development expenses also consist of personnel expenses, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, benefits, consulting costs, and allocated overhead costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe plan to continue investing in research and development activities for the foreseeable future as we focus on developing innovative products, including our preeclampsia test and our precision medicine product candidates, through preclinical studies and clinical trials. We also expect our investment in research and development to increase as we pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates and as we seek to expand our pipeline of product candidates.\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments as a result of the pandemic, certain of our research and development activities have been delayed and may be further delayed until such operational limitations are lifted or if they are reinstated. While we have implemented and continue to monitor mitigation strategies, where possible, certain preclinical and clinical activities are suspended during the implementation of these policies and will necessarily incur some delay following the resumption of normal operations.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, commissions, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for our sales and marketing team. Selling and marketing expenses also include costs for communication, advertising, conferences, other marketing events, and allocated overhead costs. We expect selling and marketing expense to continue to increase as we increase the size of our selling and marketing function to support the growth of our business. We have implemented and continue to monitor mitigation strategies to address the work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While largely yet to be determined, these mitigation strategies include virtual meetings and mobile phlebotomy services for patients preferring not to visit a physician's office. These strategies and others may cause increases in our sales and marketing costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits, for our finance and accounting, legal, human resources, and other administrative teams. Additionally, these expenses include professional fees of audit, legal, and recruiting services. Following the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq, we expect to continue to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a U.S. securities exchange and costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In addition, as a public company, we expect to incur increased expenses in the areas of insurance, investor relations, and professional services. Furthermore, we expect to incur expenses related to maintaining compliance with the stipulations of the government settlement and the legal costs associated with the Natera lawsuit, the Ravgen lawsuit and IPO related litigation described in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d in this Annual Report. As a result, we expect the dollar amount of our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future. We expect, however, that our general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is primarily attributable to borrowings under our Credit Agreement (as defined below). Interest expense is also attributable to our outstanding mortgages and capital lease agreements.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest and other income, net primarily consists of changes in fair value of our embedded derivative liability related to the convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of our obligations outstanding under the Credit and Security Agreement, as amended, in the fourth quarter of 2020, loss on extinguishment of convertible note in the second quarter of 2020 and interest income earned from our cash and cash equivalents, and changes in fair value of short-term investments.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe account for income taxes under the asset-and-liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are recognized in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Due to losses generated in the past and projected future taxable losses anticipated in the future, we established a 100% valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, was enacted. The CARES Act includes several significant provisions for corporations, including the usage of net operating losses, interest deductions and payroll benefits. Corporate taxpayers may carryback net operating losses, or NOLs, originating during 2018 through 2020 for up to five years. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of $37.7 million related to the NOL carryback provisions available under the CARES Act legislation for taxes paid in years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017. We agreed to pay 65% of any tax refund received in excess of $5.0 million in a single year, along with other civil settlements, damages awards, and tax refunds, to accelerate payments to the government in connection with our government settlement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received a tax refund of $37.7 million related to the NOL carryback provisions available under the CARES Act. As of December 31, 2020, we had paid a total of $37.0 million to the government in connection with our government settlements. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings-Federal Investigations\u201d in this Annual Report.\nResults of Operations.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nTable 345: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

The tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2020 was recorded primarily due to the NOL carryback provisions available under the CARES Act legislation enacted in March 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we established a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets due to losses generated in 2018 and projected taxable losses anticipated in the future. The tax benefit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 was recorded due to refunds received during 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources.\nSince our inception, our primary sources of liquidity have been generated by our operations, sales of common stock, preferred stock and warrants and cash from debt financings.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $92.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, convertible notes outstanding of $168.5 million, and mortgages outstanding of $3.1 million. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2020, was $541.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $192.5 million and cash used in operations of $165.7 million. Our primary requirements for liquidity have been to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends, research and development, and general corporate needs. In addition, in February 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement for a private placement with certain institutional and accredited investors and sold an aggregate of 4,370,629 units representing (i) 4,370,629 shares of our common stock and (ii) warrants to purchase up to 4,370,629 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $25.0 million.\nBased on our planned operations, we do not expect that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. We intend to raise additional capital through equity offerings and/or debt financings or from other potential sources of liquidity, which may include new collaborations, licensing or other commercial agreements for one or more of our research programs or patent portfolios. Adequate funding, if needed, may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or other operations. If any of these events occur, our ability to achieve our operational goals would be adversely affected. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those described in Risk Factors.\u201d Depending on the severity and direct impact of these factors on us, we may be unable to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on terms favorable to us, or at all. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nCredit and Security Agreements, Series B Preferred Stock, and Convertible Notes\nOn October 27, 2017, we entered into a credit and security agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with a fund managed by Athyrium, as collateral agent and a lender. The Credit Agreement provided for a term loan of $75.0 million, the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock, and the issuance of a warrant to purchase Series B Preferred Stock, or the Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant. The Credit Agreement was discharged in December 2020 in connection with the offering of Convertible Notes described below. The Credit Agreement contained customary covenants, including a requirement to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance at all times of at least $5.0 million. The term loan was secured by all our tangible and intangible property assets, with the exception of our intellectual property. The term loan accrued interest at a rate per annum equal to 9.5% and was due October 27, 2022.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized interest expense on the term loan of $7.5 million and $8.9 million, respectively.\nIn connection with the IPO, on June 18, 2020, the Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant became exercisable for 400,160 shares of common stock.\nOn August 27, 2019, we entered into a Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition LP, a fund managed by Athyrium, pursuant to which we issued 9,090,910 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at $2.75 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $25.0 million. A 1.283636364-for-1 stock split for our Series B Preferred Stock shares and Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant issued and outstanding previously was effected on August 27, 2019 pursuant to an amendment and restatement of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. As a result of the stock split, we issued an additional 4,017,512 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and adjusted the Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant to be a warrant to purchase 1,818,182 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. On August 27, 2019, we executed an exchange agreement with our Series A-1 Preferred Stock holders, pursuant to which 1,500,000 outstanding shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock were exchanged for 35,664,240 shares of Series B Preferred Stock.\nOn November 12, 2019, we entered into a Series B Stock Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, or the 2019 Series B Stock Purchase Agreement, with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition 2 LP, a fund managed by Athyrium, pursuant to which we issued an additional 11,111,111 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at $2.25 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $25.0 million.

The conversion price of the Series B Preferred Stock and exercise price of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant were lowered from $2.75 to $2.25 per share (or $13.90 per share as a result of the reverse stock split effected on June 10, 2020). As a result of the stock split effected on November 12, 2019, we issued an additional 13,985,993 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and adjusted the Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant to be a warrant to purchase 2,222,222 shares of Series B Preferred Stock.\nOn November 22, 2019, we completed an additional equity financing pursuant to the 2019 Series B Stock Purchase Agreement executed on November 12, 2019 with Beaver Creek Intermediate Fund, Ltd., an existing investor and Dr. Stylli, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for an aggregate purchase price of $6.1 million.

We issued an aggregate of 5,066,666 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $2.25 per share.\nOn March 31, 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement, or the Credit Agreement Amendment, with the collateral agent and lender party thereto, providing for the payment of interest due and payable as of March 31, 2020 in shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, and further providing for the payment of interest due and payable as of June 30, 2020 in shares of our Series B Preferred Stock in the event our IPO had not been consummated by such date. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement Amendment, we concurrently entered into a Series B Preferred Stock Subscription Agreement, or the Subscription Agreement, with the lender, which provided for the issuance of 967,130 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a subscription price of $2.25 per share, as payment for interest due and payable as of March 31, 2020 and all applicable fees as set forth in the Credit Agreement Amendment. The Subscription Agreement further provided for a potential additional issuance of shares of Series B Preferred Stock as payment for the interest due and payable under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2020, in the event our IPO had not been consummated by such date, with the amount of shares to be determined at such time.\nOn April 3, 2020, we entered into a Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition 2 LP, pursuant to which we issued an additional 4,444,444 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at $2.25 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million.\nOn May 8, 2020, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with Athyrium Opportunities 2020 LP, a fund managed by Athyrium, pursuant to which we issued and sold an unsecured convertible promissory note, or the Convertible Note, with an annual interest rate of 8.0% and in an aggregate principal amount of $15.0 million. The Convertible Note had a maturity date of May 8, 2022 and was convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at a per share conversion price of the lesser of $13.90 and eighty percent of the public price. In connection with the issuance and sale of the Convertible Note, we entered into (i) the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated May 6, 2020, or the Second Credit Agreement Amendment, allowing for the creation or incurrence of certain indebtedness and the making of payments, in each case, in respect of the Convertible Note, among other matters, and (ii) the Second Amendment to Series B Preferred Stock Warrant, dated May 8, 2020, providing for the removal of certain restrictive exercise provisions in the Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant. In June 2020, in connection with completion of our IPO, the Note was converted into 1,250,000 shares of common stock and all obligations under the Convertible Note were extinguished.\nIn December 2020, in connection with a private offering of the convertible notes pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, we issued a total of $168.5 million principal amount of our Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture, dated as of December 7, 2020, by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, or the Indenture. The Convertible Notes are due on December 1, 2025, unless earlier repurchased,\nredeemed or converted, and accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to 7.25% payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, with the initial payment on June 1, 2021.\nThe Convertible Notes are our senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with our existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent we are not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of our subsidiaries.\nAt any time, noteholders may convert their Convertible Notes at their option into shares of our common stock, together, if applicable, with cash in lieu of any fractional share, at the then-applicable conversion rate. The initial conversion rate is 278.0094 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $3.60 per share of common stock. Noteholders that convert their Notes before December 1, 2022 will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to an additional cash payment representing the present value of any remaining interest payments on the Convertible Notes through December 1, 2022. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time.\nThe Convertible Notes are redeemable, in whole and not in part, at our option at any time on or after December 1, 2023, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the our common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date we send the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date we send such notice. In addition, calling the Convertible Notes will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, which will result in an increase to the conversion rate in certain circumstances for a specified period of time.\nThe Convertible Notes have customary provision relating to the occurrence of Events of Default (as defined in the Indenture), which include the following: (i) certain payment defaults on the Convertible Notes (which, in the case of a default in the payment of interest on the Convertible Notes, will be subject to a 30-day cure period); (ii) our failure to send certain notices under the Indenture within specified periods of time; (iii) our failure to comply with certain covenants in the Indenture relating to the Company's ability to consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, lease or otherwise transfer, in one transaction or a series of transactions, all or substantially all of our assets and assets of our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to another person; (iv) a default by us in our other obligations or agreements under the Indenture or the Convertible Notes if such default is not cured or waived within 60 days after notice is given in accordance with the Indenture; (v) certain defaults by us or any of our subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness for borrowed money of at least $7,500,000; (vi) the rendering of certain judgments against us or any of our subsidiaries for the payment of at least $7,500,000, where such judgments are not discharged or stayed within 60 days after the date on which the right to appeal has expired or on which all rights to appeal have been extinguished; and (vii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization involving us or any of our significant subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such covenants.\nMortgages\nIn January 2014, we executed a mortgage with Comerica Bank for $1.8 million for the purpose of acquiring a facility located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which was previously leased by us and is used primarily for laboratory testing and research purposes. The outstanding balance was $1.3 million and $1.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The mortgage matures in 2024 and requires monthly principal and interest payments at a fixed interest rate of 2.94% plus a floating rate at LIBOR. We also have a mortgage with American Bank of Commerce (originally executed in February 2008) outstanding on Avero Diagnostic's property located in Lubbock, Texas, which is used primarily for laboratory testing. The outstanding balance was $1.7 million and $1.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The mortgage matures in 2029 and requires monthly principal and interest payments at an interest rate of 3.25%.\nCash Flows\nOur primary uses of cash are to fund our operations and research and development as we continue to grow our business. We expect to continue to incur operating losses in future periods as our operating expenses increase to support the growth of our business. We expect that our research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we expand our marketing efforts and increase our internal sales force to drive increased adoption of and reimbursement for our tests, continue our research and development efforts with respect to our current tests and further develop our product pipeline, including our preeclampsia test and precision medicine products under development. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 356: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (165,744\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (106,124\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,944\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 229,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 of $165.7 million was primarily attributable to a $192.5 million net loss, adjusted for $78.0 million of non-cash charges, primarily driven by $33.5 million of noncash revenue reserve, $13.9 million of expense related to change in the fair value of derivative liability, $11.0 million of loss on extinguishment of debt, $10.7 million of stock-based compensation expense and $5.1 million of depreciation and amortization expense. The net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $51.1 million was primarily attributable to a $61.5 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities, offset by an $9.5 million decrease in accounts receivable.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $106.1 million was primarily attributable to a $148.0 million net loss. This was partially offset by a $17.8 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as well as a $9.1 million increase in other long-term liabilities primarily as a result of noncash revenue accrual for settlement negotiations with the Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York for $39.7 million. The net loss was also partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in accounts receivable primarily as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $4.9 million was attributable to the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 of $16.5 million was primarily driven by $31.4 million from the sale of short-term investments. The cash inflow was partially offset by cash outflows of $11.2 million for purchases of short-term investments and $3.7 million for purchases of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $229.7 million was primarily attributable to $116.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock, $99.7 million in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and $21.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock, partially offset by $6.7 million in payments for insurance coverage financing, $0.7 million in principal payments on capital lease obligations and $0.3 million in principal payments on mortgages payable. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 of $73.6 million was primarily attributable to $79.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock and $0.5 million in proceeds from issuance of common stock, partially offset by $4.5 million in dividends paid, $1.0 million in principal payments on capital lease obligations, and $0.2 million in principal payments on mortgages payable, and $0.2 million in payments for deferred costs.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, and are not required to provide the information under this item.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions using historical experience and other factors; however, actual results could differ materially from these estimates and could have an adverse effect on our financial statements.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements elsewhere in this prospectus, we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are most critical to understanding and evaluating our historical and future performance.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is primarily derived from providing molecular laboratory tests to customers. We invoice and collect from third-party payors, laboratory services intermediaries, and self-paying individuals. Third-party payors include commercial payors, such as health insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and government payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States. We bill for these tests rendered upon completion of the testing process and delivery of test results to the customer.\nWe adopted the new revenue recognition guidance, ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. The transition method was applied to all contracts that were not yet complete as of January 1, 2019. The cumulative impact of adoption was recorded as an adjustment of $23.7 million to increase the opening balance of accounts receivable and decrease accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2019.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, we follow a five-step process to recognize revenue: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognize revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. We have evaluated our contracts with healthcare insurers, government payors, laboratory partners, and patients and identified a single performance obligation in those contracts, the delivery of a test result. We satisfy our performance obligation at a point in time upon the delivery of the test result, at which point control is transferred to the customer, and we can bill for the tests. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled, or the transaction price, and considers the effects of variable consideration, which is discussed below.\nThe transaction price is an estimate and may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration includes reimbursement from healthcare insurers, government payors, and patients and is adjusted for estimates of disallowed cases, discounts, and refunds using the expected value approach. Tests billed to healthcare insurers and directly to patients can take up to six months to collect and we may be paid less than the full amount billed or not be paid at all. For insurance carriers and government payors, we utilize the expected value approach using a portfolio of relevant historical data for payors with similar reimbursement experience. The portfolio estimate is developed using historical reimbursement data from payors and patients, as well as known current reimbursement trends not reflected in the historical data. Such variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainties with respect to the amount are resolved. We monitor these estimates at each reporting period based on actual cash collections in order to assess whether a revision to the estimate is required. Both the initial estimate and any subsequent revision to the estimate contain uncertainty and require the use of judgment in the estimation of the transaction price and application of the constraint for variable consideration. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. The consideration expected from laboratory partners is generally a fixed amount.\nEmbedded Derivative Related to Convertible Notes\nThe Convertible Notes due in December 2025 have a conversion option which was required to be bifurcated upon issuance and then periodically remeasured to fair value separately as an embedded derivative. The conversion option includes additional interest payments payable to the noteholders if converted prior to December 1, 2022. We utilize a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of the embedded features, which incorporates inputs including the common stock price, volatility of common stock, and time to maturity. The embedded feature will be remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date with a resulting gain or loss related to the change in the fair value being recorded to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the embedded derivative was $18.4 million as presented in our consolidated balance sheet. Changes in our assumptions used to value the embedded derivative, such as our stock price and the estimated volatility of common stock, could result in material changes in the valuation in future periods.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions including assumptions including volatility, expected term, and risk-free interest rate. Compensation related to service-based awards are recognized starting on the grant date on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally four years.\nDetermining the grant date fair value of options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires management to make assumptions and judgments. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously. The Company's key assumptions and estimates are as follows:\nTable 357: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expected term - The expected term represents the period that stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. Our historical share option exercise information is limited due to a lack of sufficient data points and does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term. The expected term for option grants is therefore determined using the simplified method. The simplified method deems the expected term to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the contractual life of the stock-based awards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 358: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expected volatility - The expected volatility was derived from the historical stock volatilities of comparable peer public companies within our industry that are considered to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based awards, since there has been no trading history of our common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 359: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Risk free interest rate - The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the stock-based awards' expected term.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 360: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expected dividend yield - The expected dividend yield is zero as we have no plans to make dividend payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following assumptions were used for the Black-Scholes option valuation model:\nTable 361: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4% - 1.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4% - 2.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.0% - 71.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.0% - 71.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected life (years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0 - 6.3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.25 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that fair value of the reporting unit has been reduced to less than its carrying value. We may choose to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.\nIf, after assessing qualitative factors, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. If deemed necessary, a two-step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is considered not impaired; otherwise, there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired and the amount of the loss, if any, is measured by performing step two. Under step two, the impairment loss, if any, is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill.\nIntangible assets consist of identifiable intangible assets acquired through acquisitions. Identifiable intangible assets include payor relationships, trade names, and noncompete agreements. We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their useful lives. We amortize noncompete covenants using the straight-line method over the terms of the related agreements. We review for impairment of intangible assets with estimable useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. No impairment existed as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period and, as a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We also intend to rely on other exemptions provided by\nthe JOBS Act, including without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those described in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview and Recent Developments\nWe are a biotechnology company with an established track record of success in developing and commercializing molecular testing products as well as innovating in the field of precision medicine. We believe that we are a market-leading provider of in vitro molecular tests designed to improve lives by providing actionable information that helps guide patients and physicians in making critical and timely medical decisions during various life stages, such as family planning, pregnancy, or navigating a complex disease diagnosis. Our vision is to transform healthcare to become more precise and personal by improving diagnoses of disease and improving patient outcomes through localized treatment with targeted therapies. We apply a multi-omics approach, combining genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, to our molecular testing products and to the development of a suite of investigational ingestible devices and drug/device combinations designed to provide precise diagnostic sampling and drug delivery solutions.\nOur internal core competencies, deep research and development pipeline and strategic acquisitions of novel technologies have fueled our innovation in women's health, supporting the development and launch of complementary molecular testing products that inform critical healthcare decision-making across a woman's lifetime.\nIn 2015, we launched both our Innatal Prenatal Screen, a Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing, or NIPT, offering, and our Preparent Carrier Test, followed by the launch of our Riscover Hereditary Cancer Test in 2017. We offer molecular tests with market-leading performance and turnaround times, supported by end-to-end workflow solutions that increase administrative efficiencies. Along with our comprehensive menu of molecular tests, we offer patients pre-test education, clear and timely results, and on-demand genetic counseling. We are committed to providing patients and physicians with empathetic communication and support during critical moments to help empower and prepare patients and their families to make critical life decisions.\nWe generate revenue by providing tests. Our molecular tests are provided through our certified Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, and College of American Pathologists, or CAP, accredited laboratory located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We also provide anatomic and molecular pathology tests through our affiliation with Mattison Pathology, LLP, a Texas limited liability partnership doing business as Avero Diagnostics, located in Lubbock and Irving, Texas. The focus of our commercial operations is to distribute our molecular tests and our anatomic and molecular pathology tests through our dedicated direct sales force. Distribution of our tests is supported by a field operations team who provide all logistical functions in receiving clinical samples at the laboratory for analysis. In the second quarter of 2020, we added COVID-19 testing to our offering and began offering COVID-19 testing nationally in mid-November 2020. Future demand for COVID-19 testing is becoming increasing difficult to predict due to various factors, including but not limited to, the availability of vaccinations, the number of individuals who choose to be vaccinated, the effectiveness of the various vaccinations against variants, the rate of new cases, and evolving government directives, laws, regulations and rules related to COVID-19 testing. In the long term, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will eventually dissipate and, as a result, the significance of COVID-19 testing to our business and financial results will decrease.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we accessioned approximately 320,000 and 329,000 tests, respectively.\nWe generate revenue through providing our tests and receiving payments for such tests from payors, laboratory distribution partners, and self-paying individuals. More than 95% of payments for our tests are received through reimbursement. We receive reimbursement from several distinct channels: commercial third-party payors, laboratory distribution partners, and government health benefits programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nWe are engaged in research and development activities with respect to molecular tests and precision medicine product candidates. Our molecular test portfolio and pipeline and our precision medicine product pipeline are each powered by a combination of symbiotic technology platforms exploiting advances in genetics, epigenetics, and proteomics, fortified by an innovative bioinformatics infrastructure. Our ecosystem is designed to enable rapid development and validation of products in an integrated fashion. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development activities as a public company. As a result, we expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may need to raise additional capital in order to fund our operations. Our ability to return to profitability will depend upon achieving our revenue growth objectives and successfully managing our costs.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we successfully achieved a key milestone in the verification phase of our rule out assay for preeclampsia and held a preeclampsia research and development day.\nIn February 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement for a private placement with certain institutional and accredited investors, or the Purchasers. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers purchased an aggregate of 4,370,629 units, or the Units, representing (i) 4,370,629 shares of our common stock and (ii) warrants to purchase up to 4,370,629 shares of common stock. The purchase price for each Unit was $5.72, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $25.0 million. The warrants are exercisable for cash at an exercise price of $6.86 per share, subject to adjustments as provided under the terms of the warrants. The warrants are immediately exercisable for cash and expire on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance. If exercised for cash, the warrants would result in additional gross proceeds to us of approximately $30.0 million.\nIn December 2020, we issued and sold 8,792,047 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering, at a price of $3.27 per share. We received approximately $26.9 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn December 2020, in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, we issued a total of $168.5 million principal amount of our Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture, dated as of December 7, 2020, by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, or the Indenture. The Convertible Notes are due on December 1, 2025, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted, and accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to 7.25% payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, with the initial payment on June 1, 2021.\nIn November 2020, we approved a reduction in force that resulted in the termination of approximately 9.5% of our workforce, or approximately 67 employees. The reduction in force was implemented in order to enable us to decrease its costs and more effectively align resources to business priorities. The reduction in force was a component of our broader efforts to materially reduce our research and development expenses by focusing on key milestones and to limit progression of other costs to track our top line performance.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe there are several important factors that impact our commercial performance and results of operations, including:\nReport Volume\nWe compete in the molecular testing market based upon several factors, including (i) the strong performance and short turnaround time of our integrated tests, (ii) the quality of our sales and marketing efforts with physicians, (iii) the quality of our end-to-end customer service and support solutions, and (iv) the availability of reimbursement for our tests. Our commercial team of more than 150 individuals actively engages with physicians and their staff to emphasize the clinical need for our products, provide education on the clinical value of our products, and facilitate the ability of physicians and their staff to order our tests. The volume of tests that we accession is one of the key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. A test is accessioned when we receive the test samples at our laboratory, the relevant information about the desired test is entered into our systems, and the samples are routed into the appropriate process flow. The historical ratio of the Innatal tests and the Preparent tests that we accession is approximately 1.2:1. As the types and categories of tests that are covered by reimbursement increase or decrease, the volume of testing may correspondingly increase or decrease, respectively. In 2019, we conducted a comprehensive review of our existing accounts and sought to eliminate accounts that did not contribute to our revenues and our gross margin. Our test volumes decreased partly as a result of this exercise.\nBeginning in March 2020, we began to observe declines in the volumes of both our molecular tests and the pathology tests conducted by Avero Diagnostics due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state and local governments. However, we believe our business is resilient and we observed positive signs of recovery in the second half of 2020. While we have implemented and continue to monitor our mitigation strategies to address these limitations, such as supporting patients and physicians virtually and offering COVID-19 PCR testing, there can be no assurance that the rate of decline in our testing volumes will not continue or accelerate in future periods. Our current assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is that our NIPT test volumes have proved more resilient than our carrier screening test volumes; however, the comparative impact may continue to change over time.\nReimbursement\nReimbursement fluctuations may occur due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 third-party payor coverage and, as we continually seek to transition to in-network coverage with commercial third-party payors, corresponding increases in our in-network covered lives; \n \u2022 regulatory and medical society recommendations such as CMS, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG, ACMG, and SMFM, that potentially lead to positive coverage determinations by commercial third-party payors and government health benefits programs for our tests; \n \u2022 third-party payor medical coverage and administrative policies, including reimbursement rates published by CMS; \n \u2022 delays to third-party payors' processing due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments; \n \u2022 future CPT code and medical procedure code changes, such as obtaining appropriate codes for our new molecular tests, including our expanded carrier screening panels, NIPT, and Exon carrier screening; \n \u2022 regulatory and payor fee schedule changes for CPT codes with respect to our products; \n \u2022 requirements to refund any reimbursements already received; \n \u2022 the overall mix of payor class for our products sold; \n \u2022 changes in physician ordering trends; \n \u2022 the mix of our products sold; \n \u2022 the geographic regions in which our products are sold; \n \u2022 competition in our industries and any change in the competitive landscape of our industries, including potential consolidation; and \n \u2022 future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies. \nGross Margin\nOur gross margin is an important indicator of the operating performance of our business. Higher gross margins reflect the average selling price of our tests, as well as the operating efficiency of our laboratory operations. Reducing the costs of goods sold for our tests represents another important opportunity for innovation and is a significant area of focus for our research and development organization. We regularly evaluate our operations in order to determine whether we can reduce costs by developing new technologies, improving the efficiency of our assay and laboratory processes, modifying our processes to use materials and technologies that provide equal or greater quality at lower cost, and improving how we manage our inventory and negotiating favorable terms for our materials purchases. We are currently developing our next generation Innatal Prenatal Screen (Innatal 4th Generation), an improved platform with simplified and more cost-effective assay workflow, which we believe will allow us to substantially improve the gross margin of our NIPT. We also work with partner laboratories that complement our test portfolio offering, while developing in parallel new technologies that we expect could, over time, reduce our cost structure by internalizing the production of those tests when the commercial benefits dictate such conversion. We are now predominantly an in-network provider, with approximately 146 million covered lives nationwide under our agreements with commercial third-party payors following the recent additions of in-network contracts with Aetna and Cigna. While we continue our contract negotiation process with several additional large commercial third-party payors, the transition to establishing ourselves as an in-network provider is expected to lead to an increase in the proportion of tests paid and allow us to gain access to a larger in-network patient base.\nNew Product Development\nOur business involves significant investment in research and development activities for the development of new products which we believe are strategic complements to our product portfolio and drive long-term revenue growth. We intend to continue investing in our pipeline of new products and technologies. We expect our investment in research and development to increase as we pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates and as we seek to expand our pipeline of product candidates. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments, certain of our research and development activities have been delayed and may be further delayed until such operational limitations are lifted. While we are implementing mitigation strategies, where possible, certain preclinical and clinical activities were suspended during the implementation of these policies and will necessarily incur some delay following the resumption of normal operations. While some of our research and development laboratory work was impacted by the stay-at-home shutdown, especially in\nour Michigan facilities, our preeclampsia test verification work restarted in June and has now migrated to the operations laboratory, which is part of our essential services, and is, therefore, less exposed to further shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the development of our new products could continue to be delayed if any stay-at-home orders in the State of Michigan are reinstated.\nThe achievement of key development milestones (e.g., clinical verification and validation and CLIA certification for our molecular tests and clinical studies and regulatory approval for our precision medicine product platform) is a key factor in evaluating our performance.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations.\nRevenue\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from molecular laboratory tests, principally from the sale of Innatal, Preparent, and pathology molecular testing. Historically, the revenue we derive from our Innatal tests and our Preparent tests has been roughly equal, although the ratio fluctuates from time to time. We bill and collect from third-party payors, laboratory distribution partners, and self-paying individuals. Third-party payors include commercial third-party payors and government payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States. We bill for these tests rendered upon completion of the testing process and delivery of test results to the customer.\nDue to potential future changes in insurance coverage policies, contractual rates, and other trends in the reimbursement of our tests, payments received for our tests may fluctuate significantly over time. Our revenue incorporates an estimate of variable consideration, which is adjusted for estimates of disallowed cases, discounts, and refunds. We have established an accrual for refunds of payments previously made by healthcare insurers based on historical experience and executed settlement agreements with healthcare insurers. The refunds are accounted for as reductions in revenues in the statement of operations as an element of variable consideration. Our estimate of variable consideration included in the transaction price is also impacted by our ongoing transition to in-network contracts with commercial payors.\nCurrently, we operate primarily as an in-network provider of molecular tests and we continually seek to transition to in-network coverage with additional third-party payors, which we believe is crucial to our growth and long-term success. This transition is ongoing, and we are actively negotiating with a few remaining commercial payors. We are currently contracted with payors representing an estimated 146 million covered lives.\nWhile the negotiated fees under our in-network contracts with third-party payors are typically lower than the out-of-network list price of our tests, the percentage of tests allowed by payors under in-network contracts traditionally increases in accordance with payors' medical or administrative policies. While we expect the reduction in average reimbursement per test from in-network pricing to reduce our per test revenue and gross margins in the near term, in-network pricing is more predictable than out-of-network pricing, and we intend to continue to mitigate the impact by implementing a strategic focus for our most profitable accounts.\nDelays to third-party payors' processing due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments have and may continue to extend the typical timelines. These factors might delay the time period in which cash is collected from payors and impact our revenue recognition. We believe that the full impact of these delays may not yet have been reflected in our financial performance, as we customarily receive payment several months after completion of a molecular test.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales includes the cost of materials, direct labor of laboratory personnel, third-party laboratory testing services, equipment, and infrastructure expenses associated with processing blood and other samples, quality control analyses, shipping charges to transport samples and specimens from ordering physicians, clinics, or individuals, and allocated overhead, including information technology, or IT, costs. Infrastructure expenses include allocated facility and related occupancy costs. Costs associated with the performance of molecular tests are recorded as tests are processed. We have implemented and continue to monitor mitigation strategies to address the work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While largely yet to be determined, these mitigation strategies may cause increases in any or all of the aforementioned costs. The amount of cost of sales is related to our volume of accessioned tests, which is directly related to consumption of reagents and other laboratory support services. Therefore, growth in accessioned volume of tests results in increased cost of sales on an aggregate basis and potential modest reductions in cost of sales on a per-test basis.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with performing research and development activities to improve our tests, to reduce product costs, and to develop new products including our preeclampsia test and our precision medicine product candidates. Research and development expenses also consist of personnel expenses, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, benefits, consulting costs, and allocated overhead costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe plan to continue investing in research and development activities for the foreseeable future as we focus on developing innovative products, including our preeclampsia test and our precision medicine product candidates, through preclinical studies and clinical trials. We also expect our investment in research and development to increase as we pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates and as we seek to expand our pipeline of product candidates.\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments as a result of the pandemic, certain of our research and development activities have been delayed and may be further delayed until such operational limitations are lifted or if they are reinstated. While we have implemented and continue to monitor mitigation strategies, where possible, certain preclinical and clinical activities are suspended during the implementation of these policies and will necessarily incur some delay following the resumption of normal operations.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, commissions, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for our sales and marketing team. Selling and marketing expenses also include costs for communication, advertising, conferences, other marketing events, and allocated overhead costs. We expect selling and marketing expense to continue to increase as we increase the size of our selling and marketing function to support the growth of our business. We have implemented and continue to monitor mitigation strategies to address the work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While largely yet to be determined, these mitigation strategies include virtual meetings and mobile phlebotomy services for patients preferring not to visit a physician's office. These strategies and others may cause increases in our sales and marketing costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits, for our finance and accounting, legal, human resources, and other administrative teams. Additionally, these expenses include professional fees of audit, legal, and recruiting services. Following the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq, we expect to continue to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a U.S. securities exchange and costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In addition, as a public company, we expect to incur increased expenses in the areas of insurance, investor relations, and professional services. Furthermore, we expect to incur expenses related to maintaining compliance with the stipulations of the government settlement and the legal costs associated with the Natera lawsuit, the Ravgen lawsuit and IPO related litigation described in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d in this Annual Report. As a result, we expect the dollar amount of our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future. We expect, however, that our general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is primarily attributable to borrowings under our Credit Agreement (as defined below). Interest expense is also attributable to our outstanding mortgages and capital lease agreements.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest and other income, net primarily consists of changes in fair value of our embedded derivative liability related to the convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of our obligations outstanding under the Credit and Security Agreement, as amended, in the fourth quarter of 2020, loss on extinguishment of convertible note in the second quarter of 2020 and interest income earned from our cash and cash equivalents, and changes in fair value of short-term investments.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe account for income taxes under the asset-and-liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are recognized in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Due to losses generated in the past and projected future taxable losses anticipated in the future, we established a 100% valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, was enacted. The CARES Act includes several significant provisions for corporations, including the usage of net operating losses, interest deductions and payroll benefits. Corporate taxpayers may carryback net operating losses, or NOLs, originating during 2018 through 2020 for up to five years. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of $37.7 million related to the NOL carryback provisions available under the CARES Act legislation for taxes paid in years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017. We agreed to pay 65% of any tax refund received in excess of $5.0 million in a single year, along with other civil settlements, damages awards, and tax refunds, to accelerate payments to the government in connection with our government settlement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received a tax refund of $37.7 million related to the NOL carryback provisions available under the CARES Act. As of December 31, 2020, we had paid a total of $37.0 million to the government in connection with our government settlements. See Part I, Item 3.

due to a reduction in travel during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 related restrictions and associated work-from-home policies, a decrease of $0.7 million in advertising

$5.4 million increase in consulting and professional costs, primarily related to legal costs associated with our government settlement negotiations and litigation, and a $3.6 million increase in business insurance costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.2 million in supplies costs.\nIn addition, general and administrative expenses were $20.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, compared to $20.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020.\nInterest Expense\nTable 353: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (unaudited)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9,984\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9,199\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (785\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense increased by $0.8 million, or 8.5%, from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nTable 354: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (unaudited)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (24,888\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (25,463\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ______________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> * -

The tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2020 was recorded primarily due to the NOL carryback provisions available under the CARES Act legislation enacted in March 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we established a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets due to losses generated in 2018 and projected taxable losses anticipated in the future. The tax benefit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 was recorded due to refunds received during 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources.\nSince our inception, our primary sources of liquidity have been generated by our operations, sales of common stock, preferred stock and warrants and cash from debt financings.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $92.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, convertible notes outstanding of $168.5 million, and mortgages outstanding of $3.1 million. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2020, was $541.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $192.5 million and cash used in operations of $165.7 million. Our primary requirements for liquidity have been to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends, research and development, and general corporate needs. In addition, in February 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement for a private placement with certain institutional and accredited investors and sold an aggregate of 4,370,629 units representing (i) 4,370,629 shares of our common stock and (ii) warrants to purchase up to 4,370,629 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $25.0 million.\nBased on our planned operations, we do not expect that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. We intend to raise additional capital through equity offerings and/or debt financings or from other potential sources of liquidity, which may include new collaborations, licensing or other commercial agreements for one or more of our research programs or patent portfolios. Adequate funding, if needed, may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or other operations. If any of these events occur, our ability to achieve our operational goals would be adversely affected. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those described in Risk Factors.\u201d Depending on the severity and direct impact of these factors on us, we may be unable to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on terms favorable to us, or at all. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nCredit and Security Agreements, Series B Preferred Stock, and Convertible Notes\nOn October 27, 2017, we entered into a credit and security agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with a fund managed by Athyrium, as collateral agent and a lender. The Credit Agreement provided for a term loan of $75.0 million, the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock, and the issuance of a warrant to purchase Series B Preferred Stock, or the Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant. The Credit Agreement was discharged in December 2020 in connection with the offering of Convertible Notes described below. The Credit Agreement contained customary covenants, including a requirement to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance at all times of at least $5.0 million. The term loan was secured by all our tangible and intangible property assets, with the exception of our intellectual property. The term loan accrued interest at a rate per annum equal to 9.5% and was due October 27, 2022.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized interest expense on the term loan of $7.5 million and $8.9 million, respectively.\nIn connection with the IPO, on June 18, 2020, the Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant became exercisable for 400,160 shares of common stock.\nOn August 27, 2019, we entered into a Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition LP, a fund managed by Athyrium, pursuant to which we issued 9,090,910 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at $2.75 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $25.0 million. A 1.283636364-for-1 stock split for our Series B Preferred Stock shares and Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant issued and outstanding previously was effected on August 27, 2019 pursuant to an amendment and restatement of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. As a result of the stock split, we issued an additional 4,017,512 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and adjusted the Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant to be a warrant to purchase 1,818,182 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. On August 27, 2019, we executed an exchange agreement with our Series A-1 Preferred Stock holders, pursuant to which 1,500,000 outstanding shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock were exchanged for 35,664,240 shares of Series B Preferred Stock.\nOn November 12, 2019, we entered into a Series B Stock Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, or the 2019 Series B Stock Purchase Agreement, with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition 2 LP, a fund managed by Athyrium, pursuant to which we issued an additional 11,111,111 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at $2.25 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $25.0 million. A 1.22222222-for-1 stock split for our Series B Preferred Stock shares and Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant issued and outstanding previously was effected on November 12, 2019, pursuant to an amendment and restatement of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The conversion price of the Series B Preferred Stock and exercise price of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant were lowered from $2.75 to $2.25 per share (or $13.90 per share as a result of the reverse stock split effected on June 10, 2020). As a result of the stock split effected on November 12, 2019, we issued an additional 13,985,993 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and adjusted the Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant to be a warrant to purchase 2,222,222 shares of Series B Preferred Stock.\nOn November 22, 2019, we completed an additional equity financing pursuant to the 2019 Series B Stock Purchase Agreement executed on November 12, 2019 with Beaver Creek Intermediate Fund, Ltd., an existing investor and Dr. Stylli, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for an aggregate purchase price of $6.1 million. We issued an aggregate of 2,722,222 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $2.25 per share.\nOn December 19, 2019, we completed an additional equity financing pursuant to the 2019 Series B Stock Purchase Agreement executed on November 12, 2019 with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition 2 LP for an aggregate purchase price of $25.0 million. We issued on aggregate of 11,111,111 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $2.25 per share.\nOn February 28, 2020, we completed an additional equity financing pursuant to the 2019 Series B Stock Purchase Agreement executed on November 12, 2019 with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition 2 LP and Dr. Stylli, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for an aggregate purchase price of $11.4 million. We issued an aggregate of 5,066,666 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $2.25 per share.\nOn March 31, 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement, or the Credit Agreement Amendment, with the collateral agent and lender party thereto, providing for the payment of interest due and payable as of March 31, 2020 in shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, and further providing for the payment of interest due and payable as of June 30, 2020 in shares of our Series B Preferred Stock in the event our IPO had not been consummated by such date. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement Amendment, we concurrently entered into a Series B Preferred Stock Subscription Agreement, or the Subscription Agreement, with the lender, which provided for the issuance of 967,130 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a subscription price of $2.25 per share, as payment for interest due and payable as of March 31, 2020 and all applicable fees as set forth in the Credit Agreement Amendment. The Subscription Agreement further provided for a potential additional issuance of shares of Series B Preferred Stock as payment for the interest due and payable under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2020, in the event our IPO had not been consummated by such date, with the amount of shares to be determined at such time.\nOn April 3, 2020, we entered into a Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition 2 LP, pursuant to which we issued an additional 4,444,444 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at $2.25 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million.\nOn May 8, 2020, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with Athyrium Opportunities 2020 LP, a fund managed by Athyrium, pursuant to which we issued and sold an unsecured convertible promissory note, or the Convertible Note, with an annual interest rate of 8.0% and in an aggregate principal amount of $15.0 million. The Convertible Note had a maturity date of May 8, 2022 and was convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at a per share conversion price of the lesser of $13.90 and eighty percent of the public price. In connection with the issuance and sale of the Convertible Note, we entered into (i) the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated May 6, 2020, or the Second Credit Agreement Amendment, allowing for the creation or incurrence of certain indebtedness and the making of payments, in each case, in respect of the Convertible Note, among other matters, and (ii) the Second Amendment to Series B Preferred Stock Warrant, dated May 8, 2020, providing for the removal of certain restrictive exercise provisions in the Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant. In June 2020, in connection with completion of our IPO, the Note was converted into 1,250,000 shares of common stock and all obligations under the Convertible Note were extinguished.\nIn December 2020, in connection with a private offering of the convertible notes pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, we issued a total of $168.5 million principal amount of our Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture, dated as of December 7, 2020, by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, or the Indenture. The Convertible Notes are due on December 1, 2025, unless earlier repurchased,\nredeemed or converted, and accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to 7.25% payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, with the initial payment on June 1, 2021.\nThe Convertible Notes are our senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with our existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent we are not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of our subsidiaries.\nAt any time, noteholders may convert their Convertible Notes at their option into shares of our common stock, together, if applicable, with cash in lieu of any fractional share, at the then-applicable conversion rate. The initial conversion rate is 278.0094 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $3.60 per share of common stock. Noteholders that convert their Notes before December 1, 2022 will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to an additional cash payment representing the present value of any remaining interest payments on the Convertible Notes through December 1, 2022. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time.\nThe Convertible Notes are redeemable, in whole and not in part, at our option at any time on or after December 1, 2023, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the our common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date we send the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date we send such notice. In addition, calling the Convertible Notes will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, which will result in an increase to the conversion rate in certain circumstances for a specified period of time.\nThe Convertible Notes have customary provision relating to the occurrence of Events of Default (as defined in the Indenture), which include the following: (i) certain payment defaults on the Convertible Notes (which, in the case of a default in the payment of interest on the Convertible Notes, will be subject to a 30-day cure period); (ii) our failure to send certain notices under the Indenture within specified periods of time; (iii) our failure to comply with certain covenants in the Indenture relating to the Company's ability to consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, lease or otherwise transfer, in one transaction or a series of transactions, all or substantially all of our assets and assets of our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to another person; (iv) a default by us in our other obligations or agreements under the Indenture or the Convertible Notes if such default is not cured or waived within 60 days after notice is given in accordance with the Indenture; (v) certain defaults by us or any of our subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness for borrowed money of at least $7,500,000; (vi) the rendering of certain judgments against us or any of our subsidiaries for the payment of at least $7,500,000, where such judgments are not discharged or stayed within 60 days after the date on which the right to appeal has expired or on which all rights to appeal have been extinguished; and (vii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization involving us or any of our significant subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such covenants.\nMortgages\nIn January 2014, we executed a mortgage with Comerica Bank for $1.8 million for the purpose of acquiring a facility located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which was previously leased by us and is used primarily for laboratory testing and research purposes. The outstanding balance was $1.3 million and $1.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The mortgage matures in 2024 and requires monthly principal and interest payments at a fixed interest rate of 2.94% plus a floating rate at LIBOR. We also have a mortgage with American Bank of Commerce (originally executed in February 2008) outstanding on Avero Diagnostic's property located in Lubbock, Texas, which is used primarily for laboratory testing. The outstanding balance was $1.7 million and $1.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The mortgage matures in 2029 and requires monthly principal and interest payments at an interest rate of 3.25%.\nCash Flows\nOur primary uses of cash are to fund our operations and research and development as we continue to grow our business. We expect to continue to incur operating losses in future periods as our operating expenses increase to support the growth of our business. We expect that our research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we expand our marketing efforts and increase our internal sales force to drive increased adoption of and reimbursement for our tests, continue our research and development efforts with respect to our current tests and further develop our product pipeline, including our preeclampsia test and precision medicine products under development. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 356: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (165,744\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (106,124\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,944\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 229,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 of $165.7 million was primarily attributable to a $192.5 million net loss, adjusted for $78.0 million of non-cash charges, primarily driven by $33.5 million of noncash revenue reserve, $13.9 million of expense related to change in the fair value of derivative liability, $11.0 million of loss on extinguishment of debt, $10.7 million of stock-based compensation expense and $5.1 million of depreciation and amortization expense. The net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $51.1 million was primarily attributable to a $61.5 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities, offset by an $9.5 million decrease in accounts receivable.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $106.1 million was primarily attributable to a $148.0 million net loss. This was partially offset by a $17.8 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as well as a $9.1 million increase in other long-term liabilities primarily as a result of noncash revenue accrual for settlement negotiations with the Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York for $39.7 million. The net loss was also partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in accounts receivable primarily as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $4.9 million was attributable to the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 of $16.5 million was primarily driven by $31.4 million from the sale of short-term investments. The cash inflow was partially offset by cash outflows of $11.2 million for purchases of short-term investments and $3.7 million for purchases of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $229.7 million was primarily attributable to $116.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock, $99.7 million in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and $21.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock, partially offset by $6.7 million in payments for insurance coverage financing, $0.7 million in principal payments on capital lease obligations and $0.3 million in principal payments on mortgages payable. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 of $73.6 million was primarily attributable to $79.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock and $0.5 million in proceeds from issuance of common stock, partially offset by $4.5 million in dividends paid, $1.0 million in principal payments on capital lease obligations, and $0.2 million in principal payments on mortgages payable, and $0.2 million in payments for deferred costs.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, and are not required to provide the information under this item.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions using historical experience and other factors; however, actual results could differ materially from these estimates and could have an adverse effect on our financial statements.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements elsewhere in this prospectus, we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are most critical to understanding and evaluating our historical and future performance.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is primarily derived from providing molecular laboratory tests to customers. We invoice and collect from third-party payors, laboratory services intermediaries, and self-paying individuals. Third-party payors include commercial payors, such as health insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and government payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States. We bill for these tests rendered upon completion of the testing process and delivery of test results to the customer.\nWe adopted the new revenue recognition guidance, ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. The transition method was applied to all contracts that were not yet complete as of January 1, 2019. The cumulative impact of adoption was recorded as an adjustment of $23.7 million to increase the opening balance of accounts receivable and decrease accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2019.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, we follow a five-step process to recognize revenue: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognize revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. We have evaluated our contracts with healthcare insurers, government payors, laboratory partners, and patients and identified a single performance obligation in those contracts, the delivery of a test result. We satisfy our performance obligation at a point in time upon the delivery of the test result, at which point control is transferred to the customer, and we can bill for the tests. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled, or the transaction price, and considers the effects of variable consideration, which is discussed below.\nThe transaction price is an estimate and may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration includes reimbursement from healthcare insurers, government payors, and patients and is adjusted for estimates of disallowed cases, discounts, and refunds using the expected value approach. Tests billed to healthcare insurers and directly to patients can take up to six months to collect and we may be paid less than the full amount billed or not be paid at all. For insurance carriers and government payors, we utilize the expected value approach using a portfolio of relevant historical data for payors with similar reimbursement experience. The portfolio estimate is developed using historical reimbursement data from payors and patients, as well as known current reimbursement trends not reflected in the historical data. Such variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainties with respect to the amount are resolved. We monitor these estimates at each reporting period based on actual cash collections in order to assess whether a revision to the estimate is required. Both the initial estimate and any subsequent revision to the estimate contain uncertainty and require the use of judgment in the estimation of the transaction price and application of the constraint for variable consideration. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. The consideration expected from laboratory partners is generally a fixed amount.\nEmbedded Derivative Related to Convertible Notes\nThe Convertible Notes due in December 2025 have a conversion option which was required to be bifurcated upon issuance and then periodically remeasured to fair value separately as an embedded derivative. The conversion option includes additional interest payments payable to the noteholders if converted prior to December 1, 2022. We utilize a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of the embedded features, which incorporates inputs including the common stock price, volatility of common stock, and time to maturity. The embedded feature will be remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date with a resulting gain or loss related to the change in the fair value being recorded to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the embedded derivative was $18.4 million as presented in our consolidated balance sheet. Changes in our assumptions used to value the embedded derivative, such as our stock price and the estimated volatility of common stock, could result in material changes in the valuation in future periods.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions including assumptions including volatility, expected term, and risk-free interest rate. Compensation related to service-based awards are recognized starting on the grant date on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally four years.\nDetermining the grant date fair value of options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires management to make assumptions and judgments. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously. The Company's key assumptions and estimates are as follows:\n \u2022 Expected term - The expected term represents the period that stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. Our historical share option exercise information is limited due to a lack of sufficient data points and does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term. The expected term for option grants is therefore determined using the simplified method. The simplified method deems the expected term to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the contractual life of the stock-based awards. \n \u2022 Expected volatility - The expected volatility was derived from the historical stock volatilities of comparable peer public companies within our industry that are considered to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based awards, since there has been no trading history of our common stock. \n \u2022 Risk free interest rate - The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the stock-based awards' expected term. \n \u2022 Expected dividend yield - The expected dividend yield is zero as we have no plans to make dividend payments. \nThe following assumptions were used for the Black-Scholes option valuation model:\nTable 361: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4% - 1.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4% - 2.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.0% - 71.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.0% - 71.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected life (years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0 - 6.3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.25 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that fair value of the reporting unit has been reduced to less than its carrying value. We may choose to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.\nIf, after assessing qualitative factors, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. If deemed necessary, a two-step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is considered not impaired; otherwise, there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired and the amount of the loss, if any, is measured by performing step two. Under step two, the impairment loss, if any, is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill.\nIntangible assets consist of identifiable intangible assets acquired through acquisitions. Identifiable intangible assets include payor relationships, trade names, and noncompete agreements. We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their useful lives. We amortize noncompete covenants using the straight-line method over the terms of the related agreements. We review for impairment of intangible assets with estimable useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. No impairment existed as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period and, as a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We also intend to rely on other exemptions provided by\nthe JOBS Act, including without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those described in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview and Recent Developments\nWe are a biotechnology company with an established track record of success in developing and commercializing molecular testing products as well as innovating in the field of precision medicine. We believe that we are a market-leading provider of in vitro molecular tests designed to improve lives by providing actionable information that helps guide patients and physicians in making critical and timely medical decisions during various life stages, such as family planning, pregnancy, or navigating a complex disease diagnosis. Our vision is to transform healthcare to become more precise and personal by improving diagnoses of disease and improving patient outcomes through localized treatment with targeted therapies. We apply a multi-omics approach, combining genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, to our molecular testing products and to the development of a suite of investigational ingestible devices and drug/device combinations designed to provide precise diagnostic sampling and drug delivery solutions.\nOur internal core competencies, deep research and development pipeline and strategic acquisitions of novel technologies have fueled our innovation in women's health, supporting the development and launch of complementary molecular testing products that inform critical healthcare decision-making across a woman's lifetime.\nIn 2015, we launched both our Innatal Prenatal Screen, a Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing, or NIPT, offering, and our Preparent Carrier Test, followed by the launch of our Riscover Hereditary Cancer Test in 2017. We offer molecular tests with market-leading performance and turnaround times, supported by end-to-end workflow solutions that increase administrative efficiencies. Along with our comprehensive menu of molecular tests, we offer patients pre-test education, clear and timely results, and on-demand genetic counseling. We are committed to providing patients and physicians with empathetic communication and support during critical moments to help empower and prepare patients and their families to make critical life decisions.\nWe generate revenue by providing tests. Our molecular tests are provided through our certified Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, and College of American Pathologists, or CAP, accredited laboratory located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We also provide anatomic and molecular pathology tests through our affiliation with Mattison Pathology, LLP, a Texas limited liability partnership doing business as Avero Diagnostics, located in Lubbock and Irving, Texas. The focus of our commercial operations is to distribute our molecular tests and our anatomic and molecular pathology tests through our dedicated direct sales force. Distribution of our tests is supported by a field operations team who provide all logistical functions in receiving clinical samples at the laboratory for analysis. In the second quarter of 2020, we added COVID-19 testing to our offering and began offering COVID-19 testing nationally in mid-November 2020. Future demand for COVID-19 testing is becoming increasing difficult to predict due to various factors, including but not limited to, the availability of vaccinations, the number of individuals who choose to be vaccinated, the effectiveness of the various vaccinations against variants, the rate of new cases, and evolving government directives, laws, regulations and rules related to COVID-19 testing. In the long term, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will eventually dissipate and, as a result, the significance of COVID-19 testing to our business and financial results will decrease.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we accessioned approximately 320,000 and 329,000 tests, respectively.\nWe generate revenue through providing our tests and receiving payments for such tests from payors, laboratory distribution partners, and self-paying individuals. More than 95% of payments for our tests are received through reimbursement. We receive reimbursement from several distinct channels: commercial third-party payors, laboratory distribution partners, and government health benefits programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nWe are engaged in research and development activities with respect to molecular tests and precision medicine product candidates. Our molecular test portfolio and pipeline and our precision medicine product pipeline are each powered by a combination of symbiotic technology platforms exploiting advances in genetics, epigenetics, and proteomics, fortified by an innovative bioinformatics infrastructure. Our ecosystem is designed to enable rapid development and validation of products in an integrated fashion. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development activities as a public company. As a result, we expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may need to raise additional capital in order to fund our operations. Our ability to return to profitability will depend upon achieving our revenue growth objectives and successfully managing our costs.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we successfully achieved a key milestone in the verification phase of our rule out assay for preeclampsia and held a preeclampsia research and development day.\nIn February 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement for a private placement with certain institutional and accredited investors, or the Purchasers. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers purchased an aggregate of 4,370,629 units, or the Units, representing (i) 4,370,629 shares of our common stock and (ii) warrants to purchase up to 4,370,629 shares of common stock. The purchase price for each Unit was $5.72, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $25.0 million. The warrants are exercisable for cash at an exercise price of $6.86 per share, subject to adjustments as provided under the terms of the warrants. The warrants are immediately exercisable for cash and expire on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance. If exercised for cash, the warrants would result in additional gross proceeds to us of approximately $30.0 million.\nIn December 2020, we issued and sold 8,792,047 shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering, at a price of $3.27 per share. We received approximately $26.9 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us.\nIn December 2020, in a private offering pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, we issued a total of $168.5 million principal amount of our Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture, dated as of December 7, 2020, by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, or the Indenture. The Convertible Notes are due on December 1, 2025, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted, and accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to 7.25% payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, with the initial payment on June 1, 2021.\nIn November 2020, we approved a reduction in force that resulted in the termination of approximately 9.5% of our workforce, or approximately 67 employees. The reduction in force was implemented in order to enable us to decrease its costs and more effectively align resources to business priorities. The reduction in force was a component of our broader efforts to materially reduce our research and development expenses by focusing on key milestones and to limit progression of other costs to track our top line performance.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe there are several important factors that impact our commercial performance and results of operations, including:\nReport Volume\nWe compete in the molecular testing market based upon several factors, including (i) the strong performance and short turnaround time of our integrated tests, (ii) the quality of our sales and marketing efforts with physicians, (iii) the quality of our end-to-end customer service and support solutions, and (iv) the availability of reimbursement for our tests. Our commercial team of more than 150 individuals actively engages with physicians and their staff to emphasize the clinical need for our products, provide education on the clinical value of our products, and facilitate the ability of physicians and their staff to order our tests. The volume of tests that we accession is one of the key performance indicators that we use to evaluate our business. A test is accessioned when we receive the test samples at our laboratory, the relevant information about the desired test is entered into our systems, and the samples are routed into the appropriate process flow. The historical ratio of the Innatal tests and the Preparent tests that we accession is approximately 1.2:1. As the types and categories of tests that are covered by reimbursement increase or decrease, the volume of testing may correspondingly increase or decrease, respectively. In 2019, we conducted a comprehensive review of our existing accounts and sought to eliminate accounts that did not contribute to our revenues and our gross margin. Our test volumes decreased partly as a result of this exercise.\nBeginning in March 2020, we began to observe declines in the volumes of both our molecular tests and the pathology tests conducted by Avero Diagnostics due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state and local governments. However, we believe our business is resilient and we observed positive signs of recovery in the second half of 2020. While we have implemented and continue to monitor our mitigation strategies to address these limitations, such as supporting patients and physicians virtually and offering COVID-19 PCR testing, there can be no assurance that the rate of decline in our testing volumes will not continue or accelerate in future periods. Our current assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is that our NIPT test volumes have proved more resilient than our carrier screening test volumes; however, the comparative impact may continue to change over time.\nReimbursement\nReimbursement fluctuations may occur due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 third-party payor coverage and, as we continually seek to transition to in-network coverage with commercial third-party payors, corresponding increases in our in-network covered lives; \n \u2022 regulatory and medical society recommendations such as CMS, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG, ACMG, and SMFM, that potentially lead to positive coverage determinations by commercial third-party payors and government health benefits programs for our tests; \n \u2022 third-party payor medical coverage and administrative policies, including reimbursement rates published by CMS; \n \u2022 delays to third-party payors' processing due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments; \n \u2022 future CPT code and medical procedure code changes, such as obtaining appropriate codes for our new molecular tests, including our expanded carrier screening panels, NIPT, and Exon carrier screening; \n \u2022 regulatory and payor fee schedule changes for CPT codes with respect to our products; \n \u2022 requirements to refund any reimbursements already received; \n \u2022 the overall mix of payor class for our products sold; \n \u2022 changes in physician ordering trends; \n \u2022 the mix of our products sold; \n \u2022 the geographic regions in which our products are sold; \n \u2022 competition in our industries and any change in the competitive landscape of our industries, including potential consolidation; and \n \u2022 future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies. \nGross Margin\nOur gross margin is an important indicator of the operating performance of our business. Higher gross margins reflect the average selling price of our tests, as well as the operating efficiency of our laboratory operations. Reducing the costs of goods sold for our tests represents another important opportunity for innovation and is a significant area of focus for our research and development organization. We regularly evaluate our operations in order to determine whether we can reduce costs by developing new technologies, improving the efficiency of our assay and laboratory processes, modifying our processes to use materials and technologies that provide equal or greater quality at lower cost, and improving how we manage our inventory and negotiating favorable terms for our materials purchases. We are currently developing our next generation Innatal Prenatal Screen (Innatal 4th Generation), an improved platform with simplified and more cost-effective assay workflow, which we believe will allow us to substantially improve the gross margin of our NIPT. We also work with partner laboratories that complement our test portfolio offering, while developing in parallel new technologies that we expect could, over time, reduce our cost structure by internalizing the production of those tests when the commercial benefits dictate such conversion. We are now predominantly an in-network provider, with approximately 146 million covered lives nationwide under our agreements with commercial third-party payors following the recent additions of in-network contracts with Aetna and Cigna. While we continue our contract negotiation process with several additional large commercial third-party payors, the transition to establishing ourselves as an in-network provider is expected to lead to an increase in the proportion of tests paid and allow us to gain access to a larger in-network patient base.\nNew Product Development\nOur business involves significant investment in research and development activities for the development of new products which we believe are strategic complements to our product portfolio and drive long-term revenue growth. We intend to continue investing in our pipeline of new products and technologies. We expect our investment in research and development to increase as we pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates and as we seek to expand our pipeline of product candidates. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments, certain of our research and development activities have been delayed and may be further delayed until such operational limitations are lifted. While we are implementing mitigation strategies, where possible, certain preclinical and clinical activities were suspended during the implementation of these policies and will necessarily incur some delay following the resumption of normal operations. While some of our research and development laboratory work was impacted by the stay-at-home shutdown, especially in\nour Michigan facilities, our preeclampsia test verification work restarted in June and has now migrated to the operations laboratory, which is part of our essential services, and is, therefore, less exposed to further shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the development of our new products could continue to be delayed if any stay-at-home orders in the State of Michigan are reinstated.\nThe achievement of key development milestones (e.g., clinical verification and validation and CLIA certification for our molecular tests and clinical studies and regulatory approval for our precision medicine product platform) is a key factor in evaluating our performance.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations.\nRevenue\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from molecular laboratory tests, principally from the sale of Innatal, Preparent, and pathology molecular testing. Historically, the revenue we derive from our Innatal tests and our Preparent tests has been roughly equal, although the ratio fluctuates from time to time. We bill and collect from third-party payors, laboratory distribution partners, and self-paying individuals. Third-party payors include commercial third-party payors and government payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States. We bill for these tests rendered upon completion of the testing process and delivery of test results to the customer.\nDue to potential future changes in insurance coverage policies, contractual rates, and other trends in the reimbursement of our tests, payments received for our tests may fluctuate significantly over time. Our revenue incorporates an estimate of variable consideration, which is adjusted for estimates of disallowed cases, discounts, and refunds. We have established an accrual for refunds of payments previously made by healthcare insurers based on historical experience and executed settlement agreements with healthcare insurers. The refunds are accounted for as reductions in revenues in the statement of operations as an element of variable consideration. Our estimate of variable consideration included in the transaction price is also impacted by our ongoing transition to in-network contracts with commercial payors.\nCurrently, we operate primarily as an in-network provider of molecular tests and we continually seek to transition to in-network coverage with additional third-party payors, which we believe is crucial to our growth and long-term success. This transition is ongoing, and we are actively negotiating with a few remaining commercial payors. We are currently contracted with payors representing an estimated 146 million covered lives.\nWhile the negotiated fees under our in-network contracts with third-party payors are typically lower than the out-of-network list price of our tests, the percentage of tests allowed by payors under in-network contracts traditionally increases in accordance with payors' medical or administrative policies. While we expect the reduction in average reimbursement per test from in-network pricing to reduce our per test revenue and gross margins in the near term, in-network pricing is more predictable than out-of-network pricing, and we intend to continue to mitigate the impact by implementing a strategic focus for our most profitable accounts.\nDelays to third-party payors' processing due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments have and may continue to extend the typical timelines. These factors might delay the time period in which cash is collected from payors and impact our revenue recognition. We believe that the full impact of these delays may not yet have been reflected in our financial performance, as we customarily receive payment several months after completion of a molecular test.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales includes the cost of materials, direct labor of laboratory personnel, third-party laboratory testing services, equipment, and infrastructure expenses associated with processing blood and other samples, quality control analyses, shipping charges to transport samples and specimens from ordering physicians, clinics, or individuals, and allocated overhead, including information technology, or IT, costs. Infrastructure expenses include allocated facility and related occupancy costs. Costs associated with the performance of molecular tests are recorded as tests are processed. We have implemented and continue to monitor mitigation strategies to address the work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While largely yet to be determined, these mitigation strategies may cause increases in any or all of the aforementioned costs. The amount of cost of sales is related to our volume of accessioned tests, which is directly related to consumption of reagents and other laboratory support services. Therefore, growth in accessioned volume of tests results in increased cost of sales on an aggregate basis and potential modest reductions in cost of sales on a per-test basis.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with performing research and development activities to improve our tests, to reduce product costs, and to develop new products including our preeclampsia test and our precision medicine product candidates. Research and development expenses also consist of personnel expenses, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, benefits, consulting costs, and allocated overhead costs. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe plan to continue investing in research and development activities for the foreseeable future as we focus on developing innovative products, including our preeclampsia test and our precision medicine product candidates, through preclinical studies and clinical trials. We also expect our investment in research and development to increase as we pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates and as we seek to expand our pipeline of product candidates.\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments as a result of the pandemic, certain of our research and development activities have been delayed and may be further delayed until such operational limitations are lifted or if they are reinstated. While we have implemented and continue to monitor mitigation strategies, where possible, certain preclinical and clinical activities are suspended during the implementation of these policies and will necessarily incur some delay following the resumption of normal operations.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, commissions, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for our sales and marketing team. Selling and marketing expenses also include costs for communication, advertising, conferences, other marketing events, and allocated overhead costs. We expect selling and marketing expense to continue to increase as we increase the size of our selling and marketing function to support the growth of our business. We have implemented and continue to monitor mitigation strategies to address the work-from-home policies and other operational limitations mandated by federal, state, and local governments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While largely yet to be determined, these mitigation strategies include virtual meetings and mobile phlebotomy services for patients preferring not to visit a physician's office. These strategies and others may cause increases in our sales and marketing costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits, for our finance and accounting, legal, human resources, and other administrative teams. Additionally, these expenses include professional fees of audit, legal, and recruiting services. Following the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq, we expect to continue to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a U.S. securities exchange and costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In addition, as a public company, we expect to incur increased expenses in the areas of insurance, investor relations, and professional services. Furthermore, we expect to incur expenses related to maintaining compliance with the stipulations of the government settlement and the legal costs associated with the Natera lawsuit, the Ravgen lawsuit and IPO related litigation described in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d in this Annual Report. As a result, we expect the dollar amount of our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future. We expect, however, that our general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is primarily attributable to borrowings under our Credit Agreement (as defined below). Interest expense is also attributable to our outstanding mortgages and capital lease agreements.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest and other income, net primarily consists of changes in fair value of our embedded derivative liability related to the convertible notes, loss on extinguishment of our obligations outstanding under the Credit and Security Agreement, as amended, in the fourth quarter of 2020, loss on extinguishment of convertible note in the second quarter of 2020 and interest income earned from our cash and cash equivalents, and changes in fair value of short-term investments.\nIncome Tax Provision\nWe account for income taxes under the asset-and-liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are recognized in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Due to losses generated in the past and projected future taxable losses anticipated in the future, we established a 100% valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, was enacted. The CARES Act includes several significant provisions for corporations, including the usage of net operating losses, interest deductions and payroll benefits. Corporate taxpayers may carryback net operating losses, or NOLs, originating during 2018 through 2020 for up to five years. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of $37.7 million related to the NOL carryback provisions available under the CARES Act legislation for taxes paid in years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017. We agreed to pay 65% of any tax refund received in excess of $5.0 million in a single year, along with other civil settlements, damages awards, and tax refunds, to accelerate payments to the government in connection with our government settlement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received a tax refund of $37.7 million related to the NOL carryback provisions available under the CARES Act. As of December 31, 2020, we had paid a total of $37.0 million to the government in connection with our government settlements. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings-Federal Investigations\u201d in this Annual Report.\nResults of Operations.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\n\n\nRevenue\n\nRevenue was $74.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $144.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $69.7 million, or 48.4%. This decrease was largely attributable to a decrease in test volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic during the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2020, rate degradation due to payor policy changes, partially offset by a decrease of $6.2 million in revenue reserve accruals for payor settlements compared to the prior period.\nIn addition, revenue was $14.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, compared to $25.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of $11.6 million, or 44.8%.\nCost of Sales\n\nCost of sales was $93.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $100.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $7.1 million, or 7.0%.\nThe decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to a decrease in test volumes in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expense following the IPO in June 2020.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses were $47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $15.7 million, or 24.7%. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a $14.7 million decrease in consulting costs, as well as a $4.5 million decrease in supplies costs and other expenses, partially offset by a $4.2 million increase in salaries and stock-based compensation expenses.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in research and development expenses from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2019, with costs broken down by program:\n\nIn addition, research and development expenses were $11.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, compared to $13.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of $1.8 million, or 13.8%.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\n\nSelling and marketing expenses were $52.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $58.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $6.0 million, or 10.2%.\nThe decrease in selling and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to a $4.7 million decrease in travel and entertainment costs due to a reduction in travel during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 related restrictions and associated work-from-home policies, a decrease of $0.7 million in advertising and promotion costs, and a decrease of $0.4 million in salaries and stock-based compensation expenses.\nIn addition, selling and marketing expenses were $12.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, compared to $13.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 5.3%.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $75.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $61.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $14.1 million, or 23.0%.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a $7.4 million increase in salaries and stock-based compensation expenses, a $5.4 million increase in consulting and professional costs, primarily related to legal costs associated with our government settlement negotiations and litigation, and a $3.6 million increase in business insurance costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.2 million in supplies costs.\nIn addition, general and administrative expenses were $20.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, compared to $20.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020.\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense increased by $0.8 million, or 8.5%, from the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nInterest and other expense, net, was $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to interest and other income, net of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThis change was primarily due to a $13.7 million increase in fair value of our embedded derivative liability related to the convertible notes, a $7.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the exchange of our obligations under the Credit and Security Agreement, as amended, for convertible notes issued to the same related party, a $3.6 million loss on extinguishment of debt associated with the conversion of an unsecured promissory note into shares of common stock upon completion of the IPO.\nIncome Tax Benefit\n\nIncome tax benefit was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to income tax benefit of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2020 was recorded primarily due to the NOL carryback provisions available under the CARES Act legislation enacted in March 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we established a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets due to losses generated in 2018 and projected taxable losses anticipated in the future. The tax benefit recorded during the year ended December 31, 2019 was recorded due to refunds received during 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources.\nSince our inception, our primary sources of liquidity have been generated by our operations, sales of common stock, preferred stock and warrants and cash from debt financings.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $92.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, convertible notes outstanding of $168.5 million, and mortgages outstanding of $3.1 million. Our accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2020, was $541.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had a net loss of $192.5 million and cash used in operations of $165.7 million. Our primary requirements for liquidity have been to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends, research and development, and general corporate needs. In addition, in February 2021, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement for a private placement with certain institutional and accredited investors and sold an aggregate of 4,370,629 units representing (i) 4,370,629 shares of our common stock and (ii) warrants to purchase up to 4,370,629 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $25.0 million.\nBased on our planned operations, we do not expect that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. We intend to raise additional capital through equity offerings and/or debt financings or from other potential sources of liquidity, which may include new collaborations, licensing or other commercial agreements for one or more of our research programs or patent portfolios. Adequate funding, if needed, may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or other operations. If any of these events occur, our ability to achieve our operational goals would be adversely affected. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those described in Risk Factors.\u201d Depending on the severity and direct impact of these factors on us, we may be unable to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on terms favorable to us, or at all. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nCredit and Security Agreements, Series B Preferred Stock, and Convertible Notes\nOn October 27, 2017, we entered into a credit and security agreement, or the Credit Agreement, with a fund managed by Athyrium, as collateral agent and a lender. The Credit Agreement provided for a term loan of $75.0 million, the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock, and the issuance of a warrant to purchase Series B Preferred Stock, or the Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant. The Credit Agreement was discharged in December 2020 in connection with the offering of Convertible Notes described below. The Credit Agreement contained customary covenants, including a requirement to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance at all times of at least $5.0 million. The term loan was secured by all our tangible and intangible property assets, with the exception of our intellectual property. The term loan accrued interest at a rate per annum equal to 9.5% and was due October 27, 2022.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized interest expense on the term loan of $7.5 million and $8.9 million, respectively.\nIn connection with the IPO, on June 18, 2020, the Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant became exercisable for 400,160 shares of common stock.\nOn August 27, 2019, we entered into a Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition LP, a fund managed by Athyrium, pursuant to which we issued 9,090,910 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at $2.75 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $25.0 million. A 1.283636364-for-1 stock split for our Series B Preferred Stock shares and Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant issued and outstanding previously was effected on August 27, 2019 pursuant to an amendment and restatement of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. As a result of the stock split, we issued an additional 4,017,512 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and adjusted the Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant to be a warrant to purchase 1,818,182 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. On August 27, 2019, we executed an exchange agreement with our Series A-1 Preferred Stock holders, pursuant to which 1,500,000 outstanding shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock were exchanged for 35,664,240 shares of Series B Preferred Stock.\nOn November 12, 2019, we entered into a Series B Stock Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, or the 2019 Series B Stock Purchase Agreement, with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition 2 LP, a fund managed by Athyrium, pursuant to which we issued an additional 11,111,111 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at $2.25 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $25.0 million. A 1.22222222-for-1 stock split for our Series B Preferred Stock shares and Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant issued and outstanding previously was effected on November 12, 2019, pursuant to an amendment and restatement of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. The conversion price of the Series B Preferred Stock and exercise price of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant were lowered from $2.75 to $2.25 per share (or $13.90 per share as a result of the reverse stock split effected on June 10, 2020). As a result of the stock split effected on November 12, 2019, we issued an additional 13,985,993 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and adjusted the Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant to be a warrant to purchase 2,222,222 shares of Series B Preferred Stock.\nOn November 22, 2019, we completed an additional equity financing pursuant to the 2019 Series B Stock Purchase Agreement executed on November 12, 2019 with Beaver Creek Intermediate Fund, Ltd., an existing investor and Dr. Stylli, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for an aggregate purchase price of $6.1 million. We issued an aggregate of 2,722,222 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $2.25 per share.\nOn December 19, 2019, we completed an additional equity financing pursuant to the 2019 Series B Stock Purchase Agreement executed on November 12, 2019 with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition 2 LP for an aggregate purchase price of $25.0 million. We issued on aggregate of 11,111,111 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $2.25 per share.\nOn February 28, 2020, we completed an additional equity financing pursuant to the 2019 Series B Stock Purchase Agreement executed on November 12, 2019 with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition 2 LP and Dr. Stylli, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for an aggregate purchase price of $11.4 million. We issued an aggregate of 5,066,666 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $2.25 per share.\nOn March 31, 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement, or the Credit Agreement Amendment, with the collateral agent and lender party thereto, providing for the payment of interest due and payable as of March 31, 2020 in shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, and further providing for the payment of interest due and payable as of June 30, 2020 in shares of our Series B Preferred Stock in the event our IPO had not been consummated by such date. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement Amendment, we concurrently entered into a Series B Preferred Stock Subscription Agreement, or the Subscription Agreement, with the lender, which provided for the issuance of 967,130 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a subscription price of $2.25 per share, as payment for interest due and payable as of March 31, 2020 and all applicable fees as set forth in the Credit Agreement Amendment. The Subscription Agreement further provided for a potential additional issuance of shares of Series B Preferred Stock as payment for the interest due and payable under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2020, in the event our IPO had not been consummated by such date, with the amount of shares to be determined at such time.\nOn April 3, 2020, we entered into a Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Athyrium Opportunities III Acquisition 2 LP, pursuant to which we issued an additional 4,444,444 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at $2.25 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million.\nOn May 8, 2020, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with Athyrium Opportunities 2020 LP, a fund managed by Athyrium, pursuant to which we issued and sold an unsecured convertible promissory note, or the Convertible Note, with an annual interest rate of 8.0% and in an aggregate principal amount of $15.0 million. The Convertible Note had a maturity date of May 8, 2022 and was convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at a per share conversion price of the lesser of $13.90 and eighty percent of the public price. In connection with the issuance and sale of the Convertible Note, we entered into (i) the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement, dated May 6, 2020, or the Second Credit Agreement Amendment, allowing for the creation or incurrence of certain indebtedness and the making of payments, in each case, in respect of the Convertible Note, among other matters, and (ii) the Second Amendment to Series B Preferred Stock Warrant, dated May 8, 2020, providing for the removal of certain restrictive exercise provisions in the Series B Preferred Stock Purchase Warrant. In June 2020, in connection with completion of our IPO, the Note was converted into 1,250,000 shares of common stock and all obligations under the Convertible Note were extinguished.\nIn December 2020, in connection with a private offering of the convertible notes pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, we issued a total of $168.5 million principal amount of our Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture, dated as of December 7, 2020, by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee, or the Indenture. The Convertible Notes are due on December 1, 2025, unless earlier repurchased,\nredeemed or converted, and accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to 7.25% payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, with the initial payment on June 1, 2021.\nThe Convertible Notes are our senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with our existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, and (to the extent we are not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of our subsidiaries.\nAt any time, noteholders may convert their Convertible Notes at their option into shares of our common stock, together, if applicable, with cash in lieu of any fractional share, at the then-applicable conversion rate. The initial conversion rate is 278.0094 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $3.60 per share of common stock. Noteholders that convert their Notes before December 1, 2022 will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to an additional cash payment representing the present value of any remaining interest payments on the Convertible Notes through December 1, 2022. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time.\nThe Convertible Notes are redeemable, in whole and not in part, at our option at any time on or after December 1, 2023, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the our common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price on (i) each of at least 20 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date we send the related redemption notice; and (ii) the trading day immediately before the date we send such notice. In addition, calling the Convertible Notes will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change, which will result in an increase to the conversion rate in certain circumstances for a specified period of time.\nThe Convertible Notes have customary provision relating to the occurrence of Events of Default (as defined in the Indenture), which include the following: (i) certain payment defaults on the Convertible Notes (which, in the case of a default in the payment of interest on the Convertible Notes, will be subject to a 30-day cure period); (ii) our failure to send certain notices under the Indenture within specified periods of time; (iii) our failure to comply with certain covenants in the Indenture relating to the Company's ability to consolidate with or merge with or into, or sell, lease or otherwise transfer, in one transaction or a series of transactions, all or substantially all of our assets and assets of our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to another person; (iv) a default by us in our other obligations or agreements under the Indenture or the Convertible Notes if such default is not cured or waived within 60 days after notice is given in accordance with the Indenture; (v) certain defaults by us or any of our subsidiaries with respect to indebtedness for borrowed money of at least $7,500,000; (vi) the rendering of certain judgments against us or any of our subsidiaries for the payment of at least $7,500,000, where such judgments are not discharged or stayed within 60 days after the date on which the right to appeal has expired or on which all rights to appeal have been extinguished; and (vii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization involving us or any of our significant subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such covenants.\nMortgages\nIn January 2014, we executed a mortgage with Comerica Bank for $1.8 million for the purpose of acquiring a facility located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which was previously leased by us and is used primarily for laboratory testing and research purposes. The outstanding balance was $1.3 million and $1.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The mortgage matures in 2024 and requires monthly principal and interest payments at a fixed interest rate of 2.94% plus a floating rate at LIBOR. We also have a mortgage with American Bank of Commerce (originally executed in February 2008) outstanding on Avero Diagnostic's property located in Lubbock, Texas, which is used primarily for laboratory testing. The outstanding balance was $1.7 million and $1.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The mortgage matures in 2029 and requires monthly principal and interest payments at an interest rate of 3.25%.\nCash Flows\nOur primary uses of cash are to fund our operations and research and development as we continue to grow our business. We expect to continue to incur operating losses in future periods as our operating expenses increase to support the growth of our business. We expect that our research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we expand our marketing efforts and increase our internal sales force to drive increased adoption of and reimbursement for our tests, continue our research and development efforts with respect to our current tests and further develop our product pipeline, including our preeclampsia test and precision medicine products under development. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2020 of $165.7 million was primarily attributable to a $192.5 million net loss, adjusted for $78.0 million of non-cash charges, primarily driven by $33.5 million of noncash revenue reserve, $13.9 million of expense related to change in the fair value of derivative liability, $11.0 million of loss on extinguishment of debt, $10.7 million of stock-based compensation expense and $5.1 million of depreciation and amortization expense. The net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $51.1 million was primarily attributable to a $61.5 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities, offset by an $9.5 million decrease in accounts receivable.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $106.1 million was primarily attributable to a $148.0 million net loss. This was partially offset by a $17.8 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as well as a $9.1 million increase in other long-term liabilities primarily as a result of noncash revenue accrual for settlement negotiations with the Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York for $39.7 million. The net loss was also partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in accounts receivable primarily as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $4.9 million was attributable to the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 of $16.5 million was primarily driven by $31.4 million from the sale of short-term investments. The cash inflow was partially offset by cash outflows of $11.2 million for purchases of short-term investments and $3.7 million for purchases of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $229.7 million was primarily attributable to $116.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock, $99.7 million in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and $21.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock, partially offset by $6.7 million in payments for insurance coverage financing, $0.7 million in principal payments on capital lease obligations and $0.3 million in principal payments on mortgages payable. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 of $73.6 million was primarily attributable to $79.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock and $0.5 million in proceeds from issuance of common stock, partially offset by $4.5 million in dividends paid, $1.0 million in principal payments on capital lease obligations, and $0.2 million in principal payments on mortgages payable, and $0.2 million in payments for deferred costs.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, and are not required to provide the information under this item.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions using historical experience and other factors; however, actual results could differ materially from these estimates and could have an adverse effect on our financial statements.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements elsewhere in this prospectus, we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are most critical to understanding and evaluating our historical and future performance.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is primarily derived from providing molecular laboratory tests to customers. We invoice and collect from third-party payors, laboratory services intermediaries, and self-paying individuals. Third-party payors include commercial payors, such as health insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and government payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States. We bill for these tests rendered upon completion of the testing process and delivery of test results to the customer.\nWe adopted the new revenue recognition guidance, ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606, on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. The transition method was applied to all contracts that were not yet complete as of January 1, 2019. The cumulative impact of adoption was recorded as an adjustment of $23.7 million to increase the opening balance of accounts receivable and decrease accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2019.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, we follow a five-step process to recognize revenue: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognize revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. We have evaluated our contracts with healthcare insurers, government payors, laboratory partners, and patients and identified a single performance obligation in those contracts, the delivery of a test result. We satisfy our performance obligation at a point in time upon the delivery of the test result, at which point control is transferred to the customer, and we can bill for the tests. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled, or the transaction price, and considers the effects of variable consideration, which is discussed below.\nThe transaction price is an estimate and may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration includes reimbursement from healthcare insurers, government payors, and patients and is adjusted for estimates of disallowed cases, discounts, and refunds using the expected value approach. Tests billed to healthcare insurers and directly to patients can take up to six months to collect and we may be paid less than the full amount billed or not be paid at all. For insurance carriers and government payors, we utilize the expected value approach using a portfolio of relevant historical data for payors with similar reimbursement experience. The portfolio estimate is developed using historical reimbursement data from payors and patients, as well as known current reimbursement trends not reflected in the historical data. Such variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainties with respect to the amount are resolved. We monitor these estimates at each reporting period based on actual cash collections in order to assess whether a revision to the estimate is required. Both the initial estimate and any subsequent revision to the estimate contain uncertainty and require the use of judgment in the estimation of the transaction price and application of the constraint for variable consideration. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. The consideration expected from laboratory partners is generally a fixed amount.\nEmbedded Derivative Related to Convertible Notes\nThe Convertible Notes due in December 2025 have a conversion option which was required to be bifurcated upon issuance and then periodically remeasured to fair value separately as an embedded derivative. The conversion option includes additional interest payments payable to the noteholders if converted prior to December 1, 2022. We utilize a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of the embedded features, which incorporates inputs including the common stock price, volatility of common stock, and time to maturity. The embedded feature will be remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date with a resulting gain or loss related to the change in the fair value being recorded to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the embedded derivative was $18.4 million as presented in our consolidated balance sheet. Changes in our assumptions used to value the embedded derivative, such as our stock price and the estimated volatility of common stock, could result in material changes in the valuation in future periods.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions including assumptions including volatility, expected term, and risk-free interest rate. Compensation related to service-based awards are recognized starting on the grant date on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally four years.\nDetermining the grant date fair value of options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires management to make assumptions and judgments. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously. The Company's key assumptions and estimates are as follows:\n \u2022 Expected term - The expected term represents the period that stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. Our historical share option exercise information is limited due to a lack of sufficient data points and does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term. The expected term for option grants is therefore determined using the simplified method. The simplified method deems the expected term to be the midpoint between the vesting date and the contractual life of the stock-based awards. \n \u2022 Expected volatility - The expected volatility was derived from the historical stock volatilities of comparable peer public companies within our industry that are considered to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based awards, since there has been no trading history of our common stock. \n \u2022 Risk free interest rate - The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the stock-based awards' expected term. \n \u2022 Expected dividend yield - The expected dividend yield is zero as we have no plans to make dividend payments. \nThe following assumptions were used for the Black-Scholes option valuation model:\n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that fair value of the reporting unit has been reduced to less than its carrying value. We may choose to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.\nIf, after assessing qualitative factors, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. If deemed necessary, a two-step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is considered not impaired; otherwise, there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired and the amount of the loss, if any, is measured by performing step two. Under step two, the impairment loss, if any, is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill.\nIntangible assets consist of identifiable intangible assets acquired through acquisitions. Identifiable intangible assets include payor relationships, trade names, and noncompete agreements. We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their useful lives. We amortize noncompete covenants using the straight-line method over the terms of the related agreements. We review for impairment of intangible assets with estimable useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. No impairment existed as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for information on recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act.

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) provides a detailed overview and analysis of the company's financial performance and conditions. It should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in the annual report. Forward-looking statements are included in this discussion, and actual results may vary due to several risks and uncertainties.\n\nKey Points from the report:\n\n1. The company is a biotechnology firm focused on developing molecular testing products and precision medicine. It aims to improve diagnoses and patient outcomes through targeted therapies and diagnostic solutions.\n\n2. The company offers a range of molecular tests with efficient performance and turnaround times and includes other services such as genetic counseling. It has introduced several tests in the past for prenatal screening and hereditary cancer.\n\n3. Revenues primarily come from performing molecular tests in their CLIA and CAP accredited laboratories.
