Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCompany Overview. The Company is a financial holding company that offers a broad array of financial service products to its target market of professionals, small and medium-sized businesses, and high-net-worth individuals. Our principal operating segments are Commercial Banking and Fee-Based Lines.\nFrom December 31, 1995, the first complete fiscal year under the current management team, to December 31, 2017, our organization has grown from a bank holding company with two bank locations and total assets of $160.4 million to a diversified financial services holding company with 15 bank locations and total assets of $3.8 billion. We have also expanded into wealth and insurance services. The Company has a well-capitalized balance sheet that includes common equity, subordinated notes payable and subordinated debentures.\nEarnings are derived primarily from our net interest income, which is interest income less interest expense, and our noninterest income earned from Fee-Based Lines and banking service fees, offset by noninterest expense. As the majority of our assets are interest-earning and our liabilities are interest-bearing, changes in\ninterest rates impact our net interest margin, the largest component of our operating revenue (which is defined as net interest income plus noninterest income). We manage our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our operating results. We also have focused on reducing our dependency on our net interest margin by increasing our noninterest income.\nWe concentrate on developing an organization with personnel, management systems and products and services that will allow us to compete effectively and position us for growth. Although we strive to minimize costs that do not impact customer service, we continue to invest in systems and business production personnel to strengthen our future growth prospects.\nThe Company is focused on achieving financial objectives as part of its one to three year plan that are intended to enable the Company to achieve double-digit growth in earnings per share. We anticipate that achieving these objectives, coupled with maintaining our asset quality, will enable us to enhance shareholder return.\nSteps taken to realize progress on our financial objectives include: aligning production employee variable compensation with these objectives; strengthening internal networking to enhance synergies between product lines within the Company; formalizing a leadership development program; structuring management roles to provide more accountability; setting clear expectations for all producers and continuing to work with producers who are not meeting their goals; and building customer relationships.\nTo further our goal of limiting growth in noninterest expense, the Company conducted a comprehensive review of its staffing levels and expenditures in each functional area to identify areas for improvement. The Company intends to continually monitor incremental improvement and new areas for emphasis. The Company also completed a thorough analysis of its loan origination and credit underwriting process. Based on this review, the Company implemented procedural changes and clarified employee responsibilities in 2017, which we believe will improve operational efficiencies and improve customer satisfaction and employee morale. Finally, the Company has initiated an ongoing review of its facility strategy with a goal of servicing its customer base in a cost-effective manner. This has resulted in the closure of three bank locations, the combination of two bank locations in downtown Denver into one location, and the relocation of the Company's principal executive offices. As a result of the relocation of our principal executive offices, all of our client-facing employees in the downtown Denver area are in one location for the first time. The Company believes this will further strengthen internal synergies and will provide a broader platform to service the financial needs of its customers.\nAs discussed in Item 1. Business\u201d and Note 2 - Discontinued Operations, the Company ceased the operations of its investment banking division in the first quarter of 2015. The results of operations related to the investment banking division in 2015 have been reported as discontinued operations. The prior period disclosures in the following table have been adjusted to conform to the new presentation.\nInternally, management measures the contribution of the Fee-Based Lines before parent company management fees and overhead allocations. The Company believes this to be a more useful measurement as centralized administration expenses and overhead are generally not impacted by the Fee-Based Lines, but are most affected by the operations of the Bank. While the Company allocates a portion of the costs related to shared resources to the Fee-Based Lines, we measure their profitability based on a pre-allocation basis as it approximates the operating cash flow generated by the segment. A description of each segment is provided in Note 19 - Segments.\nCertain key metrics of our segments at or for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCorporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSupport\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFee-Based\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBanking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating revenue (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n151,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n19,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6,205)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n164,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n39,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(397)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(5,687)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n32,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating revenue (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n137,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(5,074)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n150,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n40,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,208)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4,058)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n34,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating revenue (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n127,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,870)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n142,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(542)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(3,175)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n26,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNet interest income plus noninterest income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoted below are some of the significant financial performance measures and operational results for 2017 and 2016:\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial Banking operating revenue increased 10.5% in 2017 to $151.4 million, while net income decreased 2.9% to $39.0 million.

For a discussion of the segments included in our principal activities and for certain financial information for each segment, see Segments\u201d discussed below and Note 19 - Segments.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. In making those critical accounting estimates, we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate. Different estimates we could reasonably have used, or changes in the assumptions that could occur, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectability of loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nIn determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, we analyze the various components of the loan portfolio, including impaired loans, on an individual basis. When analyzing the adequacy, we segment the loan portfolio into components with similar characteristics, such as risk classification, past due status, type of loan, industry or collateral. We have a systematic process to evaluate individual loans and pools of loans within our loan portfolio. We maintain a loan grading system whereby each loan is assigned a grade between 1 and 8, with 1 representing the highest quality credit, 7 representing a loan where collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable, and 8 representing a loss that has been or will be charged-off. Loans that are graded 5 or lower are categorized as non-classified credits, while loans graded 6 and higher are categorized as classified credits that have a higher risk of loss. Grades are assigned based upon the degree of risk associated with repayment of a loan in the normal course of business pursuant to the original terms.\nDifferences between the actual credit outcome of a loan and the risk assessment made by the Company could negatively impact the Company's earnings by requiring additional provision for loan losses. As a hypothetical example, if $25.0 million of grade 3, non-classified loans were downgraded as classified at the same historical loss factor of existing classified loans, an additional $1.5 million of provision for loan losses would be required. Conversely, a $25.0 million decrease in classified loans would result in a $1.5 million reversal of provision for loan losses.\nSee Note 4 - Loans for further discussion on management's methodology.\nFair Value\nThe Company has adopted ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), as it applies to financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under ASC 820 as the exchange price that would be received for an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nAs a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). Fair value may be used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities such as available for sale securities and derivatives in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting. Similarly, fair value may be used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets or liabilities, such as impaired loans. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, the Company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions in accordance with ASC 820 to determine the instrument's fair value. At December 31, 2017, $169.6 million of total assets, consisting of $166.8 million in available for sale securities and $2.8 million in derivative instruments, represented assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2016, $136.3 million of total assets, consisting of $133.0 million in available for sale securities and $3.3 million in derivative instruments, represented assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $9.1 million of single-issuer trust preferred securities (TPS) classified as Level 3. The fair value of these TPS is determined using broker-dealer quotes and trade data that may not be current. These TPS are classified as Level 3 due to lack of current market data and their illiquid nature. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, $9.6 million and $11.2 million, respectively, of total liabilities represented derivative instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consisted of impaired loans and OREO totaling $3.8 million and $5.4 million, at December 31, 2017. Impaired loans and OREO were $1.4 million and $5.4 million at December 31, 2016. For additional information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities see Note 18 - Fair Value Measurements.\nDeferred Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance may be established. We consider the determination of this valuation allowance to be a critical accounting policy because of the need to exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets, including projections of future taxable income. These judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. See Note 11 - Income Taxes for additional information. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required in the future if the amounts of taxes recoverable through loss carry backs decline, if we project lower levels of future taxable income, or we project lower levels of tax planning strategies. Such valuation allowance would be established through a charge to income tax expense that would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe also have other policies that we consider to be significant accounting policies; however, these policies, which are disclosed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.\nFinancial Condition\nThe Company had total assets of $3.8 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to total assets of $3.6 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion at December 31, 2016. The following\nsections address the specific components of the balance sheets and significant matters relating to those components at and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nLending Activities\nGeneral. We provide a broad range of lending services, including commercial loans, commercial and residential real estate construction loans, commercial and residential real estate-mortgage loans, consumer loans, revolving lines of credit, and tax-exempt financing. Our primary lending focus is commercial and real estate lending to small and medium-sized businesses with annual sales of $5.0 million to $75.0 million, and businesses and individuals with borrowing requirements of $250,000 to $15.0 million. At December 31, 2017, substantially all of our outstanding loans were to customers within Colorado and Arizona. Interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk, maturity, underwriting and servicing costs, principal amount, and extent of other banking relationships with the customer. Interest rates are further subject to competitive pressures, money market rates, availability of funds, and government regulations. See Net Interest Income\u201d for an analysis of the interest rates on our loans.\nCredit Procedures and Review. We address credit risk through internal credit policies and procedures, including underwriting criteria, officer and customer lending limits, a multi-layered loan approval process for larger loans, periodic document examination, justification for any exceptions to credit policies, loan review and concentration monitoring. In response to the last economic downturn, the Company expanded the resources of the credit and loan review departments to provide for a more proactive identification and management of problem credits. In addition, we provide ongoing loan officer training and review. We have a continuous loan review process designed to promote early identification of credit quality problems, assisted by dedicated Senior Credit Officers that support each geographic market and major loan class. All loan officers are charged with the responsibility of reviewing, at least on a monthly basis, all past due loans in their respective portfolios. In addition, the credit administration department establishes a watch list of loans to be reviewed by the Board of Directors of the Bank. The loan portfolio is also monitored regularly by a loan review department that reports to an executive vice president of the Company and submits reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the credit administration department.\nThe Company's credit approval process is as follows:\nTable 37: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInternal lending limits for loans extended to a single borrower are established by the Board of Directors of the Bank.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 38: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCredits equal to the Bank's internal lending limit require two signatures from either the Vice-Chairman of the Bank, Chief Credit Officer or a Bank President/Senior Credit Officer.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLoan authority of officers is approved by the Bank's Board of Directors, reviewed annually and updated according to the growth of the Bank.

Loans in the Arizona and Colorado markets increased $62.1 million and $149.4 million, respectively from December 31, 2016.\nIn 2017, the Construction & land category increased $90.0 million and Real estate - mortgage loans increased $78.4 million, contributing 80.0% of the loan growth on a combined basis. In 2016, the Real estate - mortgage loan category contributed 65.9% of the loan portfolio growth, increasing $154.9 million. Other loan categories with modest growth in 2016 included Commercial ($42.4 million), Consumer ($13.7 million), and Other ($50.8 million) loans, while Construction & land declined $26.8 million.\nUnder state law, the aggregate amount of loans we can make to one borrower is generally limited to 15% of our unimpaired capital, surplus, undivided profits and allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 2017, our individual legal lending limit was $66.4 million. The Bank's Board of Directors has established an internal lending limit of $15.0 million for normal credit extensions and $20.0 million for the highest rated credits. To accommodate customers whose financing needs exceed our internal lending limits and to address portfolio concentration concerns, we may sell loan participations to outside participants. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the outstanding balance of loan participations sold by us was $20.7 million and $15.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had loan participations purchased from other banks totaling $130.8 million and $118.3 million, respectively. We use the same analysis in deciding whether to purchase a participation in a loan as we would in deciding whether to originate the same loan.\nDue to the nature of our business as a commercial banking institution, our lending relationships are typically larger than those of a retail bank.

There were no other concentrations in excess of 10% of the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2017. The Company may be subject to additional regulatory supervisory oversight if its concentration in commercial real estate lending exceeds regulatory parameters. Pursuant to interagency\nguidance issued by the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies, supervisory criteria were put in place to define commercial real estate concentrations as:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConstruction, land development and other land loans that represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) that represent 300% or more of total risk-based capital and the real estate portfolio has increased more than 50% or more during the prior 36 months.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's exposure to commercial real estate lending was below the parameters discussed above.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into various types of transactions that include commitments to extend credit. We apply the same credit standards to these commitments as we apply to our other lending activities and have included these commitments in our lending risk evaluations. Our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments. See Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion on our commitments.\nCommercial Loans. Commercial loans increased $32.8 million, or 2.7%, from $1.22 billion at December 31, 2016 to $1.25 billion at December 31, 2017. Commercial lending consists of loans to small and medium-sized businesses in a wide variety of industries. We provide a broad range of commercial loans, including lines of credit for working capital purposes and term loans for the acquisition of equipment and other purposes. Commercial loans are generally collateralized by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, real estate and other commercial assets, and may be supported by other credit enhancements such as personal guarantees. However, where warranted by the overall financial condition of the borrower, loans may be unsecured and based on the cash flow of the business.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's commercial loan portfolio, segregated by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAt December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloan portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloan portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloan portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nManufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n85,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n96,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n135,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinance and insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n42,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n64,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHealth care\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n164,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n154,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n126,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n128,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n126,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n118,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConstruction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n68,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPublic administration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n240,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n256,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n221,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAll other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n521,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n474,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n450,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,250,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,217,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,175,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReal Estate - Mortgage Loans. Real estate mortgage loans increased $78.4 million, or 6.7%, from $1.17 billion at December 31, 2016 to $1.25 billion at December 31, 2017. Real estate mortgage loans include various types of loans for which we hold real property as collateral. We generally restrict commercial real estate lending activity to owner-occupied properties or to investor properties that are owned by customers with which we have a current banking relationship. We make commercial real estate loans at both fixed-and,floating-interest rates, with maturities generally ranging from five to 20 years. The Bank's underwriting standards generally require that a commercial real estate loan not exceed 75% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. In addition, we originate SBA 504 loans on owner-occupied properties with maturities of up to 25 years in which the SBA allows for financing of up to 90% of the project cost and takes a security position that is subordinated to us, as well as U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development loans.\nThe properties securing the Company's real estate mortgage loan portfolio are located primarily in the states of Colorado and Arizona. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, 68% and 67% of the Company's outstanding real estate mortgage loans were in the Colorado market, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's real estate mortgage portfolio, segregated by property type.\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAt December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResidential & commercial owner-occupied\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n484,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n475,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n436,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResidential & commercial investor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n764,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n61.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n695,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n59.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n579,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n57.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,249,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,171,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,016,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConstruction and land. Construction and land increased $90.0 million, or 51.6%, from $174.5 million at December 31, 2016 to $264.4 million at December 31, 2017. We have a portfolio of loans for the acquisition and development of land for residential building projects. We also finance construction projects involving one- to four-family residences. We provide financing to residential developers that we believe have demonstrated a favorable record of accurately projecting completion dates and budgeting expenses. We provide loans for the construction of both pre-sold projects and projects built prior to the location of a specific buyer (speculative loan), although speculative loans are provided on a more selective basis. Residential construction loans are due upon the sale of the completed project and are generally collateralized by first liens on the real estate and have floating interest rates. In addition, these loans generally have credit enhancements in the form of personal guarantees to provide an additional source of repayment. We typically require a permanent financing commitment or prequalification be in place before we make a residential construction loan. Moreover, we generally monitor construction draws monthly and inspect property to ensure that construction is progressing as projected. Our underwriting standards generally require that the principal amount of a speculative loan be no more than 75% of the appraised value of the completed construction project or 80% of pre-sold projects. Values are determined primarily by approved independent appraisers.\nWe also originate loans to finance the construction of multi-family, office, industrial, retail and tax credit projects. These projects are predominantly owned by the user of the property, or are sponsored by financially strong developers who maintain an ongoing banking relationship with us. Our underwriting standards generally require that the principal amount of these loans be no more than 75% of the appraised value. Values are determined primarily by approved independent appraisers.\nConstruction and land loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the construction and land portfolio are generally located in the states of Colorado and Arizona. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, 76% and 71%, respectively, of the Company's construction and land loans outstanding were generated in the Colorado market.\nConsumer Loans. Consumer loans increased $15.1 million, or 5.7%, from $267.0 million at December 31, 2016 to $282.1 million at December 31, 2017. We provide a broad range of consumer loans to customers, including personal lines of credit, home equity loans and automobile loans. In order to improve customer service, continuity and customer retention, the same loan officer often services the banking relationships of both the business and business owners or management. We offer residential mortgage loans as part of our consumer mortgage products. This residential mortgage financing program offers competitive pricing and terms for the purchase, refinance or permanent financing of mortgage loans, with an average loan size of approximately $800,000. For primary residences, the standard loan-to-value is 80% for loans up to $1.5 million. The loan-to-value decreases as the size of the loan increases, with a standard loan-to-value of 55% on loans in excess of $3.0 million. In addition, we generally only finance 5/1, and 7/1 adjustable-rate mortgage loans as well as 15-year fixed-rate loans. Residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2017 and 2016, totaled $213.8 million or 80% and $197.9 million or 74%, respectively, of the consumer loan portfolio.\nOther loans. Other loans decreased $4.8 million, or 4.7%, from $103.8 million at December 31, 2016 to $98.9 million at December 31, 2017. Other loans include lending products such as taxable and tax-exempt\nleasing, not defined as commercial real estate, acquisition and development, construction, or consumer loans.\nNonperforming Assets\nOur nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, restructured loans, loans past due 90 days or more, OREO and other repossessed assets. Nonaccrual loans are those loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued. The following table sets forth information with respect to these assets at the dates indicated.\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAt December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNonperforming loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNonaccrual loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate -

A delinquent loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes 90 days past due. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all accrued and unpaid interest on the loan is reversed and deducted from either earnings as a reduction of reported interest income for current year interest or against the allowance for interest accrued in a prior year. No additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain. When the issues relating to a nonaccrual loan are finally resolved, there may ultimately be an actual write-down or charge-off of the principal balance of the loan, which may necessitate additional charges to earnings. Restructured loans are those for which concessions, including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to the borrower, or the reduction of interest or principal, have been granted due to the borrower's weakened financial condition. Interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur. Interest income that would have been recorded had nonaccrual loans performed in accordance with their original contract terms during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was immaterial due to the low level of nonaccrual loans during those periods. OREO represents real property taken by the Company either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower. Repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers. Subsequent to acquisition at fair value, repossessed assets and OREO are carried at the lesser of cost or fair market value, less selling costs. See Note 18 - Fair Value Measurements for additional discussion on the valuation of OREO assets.\nNonperforming assets increased $4.6 million to $12.9 million at December 31, 2017, from $8.4 million at December 31, 2016.

The Company has entered into a contract to sell its largest OREO property, located in Colorado and comprising 97% of the overall OREO balance. The Company does not expect a material gain or loss on the disposition of this property. The Company has dedicated significant resources to the workout and resolution of nonaccrual loans and OREO, and continues to closely monitor the financial condition of its clients.\nIn addition to the nonperforming assets described above, the Company had 42 customer relationships considered by management to be potential problem loans with outstanding principal of approximately $27.7 million at December 31, 2017. A potential problem loan is one as to which management has concerns about the borrower's future performance under the terms of the loan contract. These loans are current as to the principal and interest and, accordingly, are not included in the nonperforming asset categories. However, further deterioration may result in the loan being classified as nonperforming. The level of potential problem loans is factored into the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses consists of three elements: (i) specific reserves determined in accordance with ASC Topic 310 - Receivables based on probable losses on specific loans; (ii) general reserves determined in accordance with guidance in ASC Topic 450 - Contingencies, based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company; and (iii) unallocated reserves, which is intended to capture potential misclassifications in the loan grading system.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's recognition of the risks of extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio. The allowance is maintained to provide for probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans and for probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is based on various factors affecting the loan portfolio, including a review of problem loans, business conditions, historical loss experience, evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral, and holding and disposal costs.

Loans charged off, net of amounts recovered from previously charged off loans, reduce the allowance for loan losses. The amount of the allowance is a function of the levels of loans outstanding, the level of nonperforming loans, historical loan loss experience, amount of loan losses charged against the reserve during a given period and current economic conditions. Federal regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, review our loans and allowance for loan and credit losses. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover anticipated loan losses. However, management may determine a need to increase the allowances for loan losses, or regulators, when reviewing the Bank's loan and commitment portfolio in the future, may request the Bank increase such allowances. Either of these events could adversely affect our earnings. Further, there can be no assurance that actual loan losses will not exceed the allowances for loan losses.\nThe methodology used in the periodic review of reserve adequacy, which is performed at least quarterly, is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in actual and expected credit losses. These changes are reflected in both the general and unallocated reserves. The historical loss ratios and estimated risk factors related to segmenting our loan portfolio, which are key considerations in this analysis, are updated quarterly. The review of reserve adequacy is performed by executive management and presented to the Audit Committee quarterly for its review and consideration. For additional information on the Company's methodology for estimating the allowance for loan and credit losses, see Note 4 - Loans.\nThe table below provides an allocation of the allowance for loan and credit losses by loan type; however, allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories:\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAt December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLoans in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLoans in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLoans in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLoans in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLoans in\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncategory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncategory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncategory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncategory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncategory\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nas a %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nas a %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nas a %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nas a %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nas a %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngross\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nallowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nallowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nallowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nallowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nallowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloans\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16,837 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,398 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24,215 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,614 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate -

The allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts, by loan classification, to be charged to the allowance. We believe that the table is a useful device for assessing the adequacy of the allowance as a whole. The allowance is utilized as a single unallocated allowance available for all loans. As part of the overall allowance, the Company maintains an unallocated portion that is intended to capture the inherent risk that certain loans may be assigned an incorrect loan grade. The Company determines the level of the unallocated allowance by reference to its migration of historical losses and the percentage of loans identified as incorrectly graded through the loan review process.\nThe Company recorded a $3.2 million provision for loan losses during 2017 compared to a $2.1 million provision for loan losses reversal during 2016. The provision for loan losses in 2017 was primarily a function of loan growth, while the negative provision in 2016 was due to improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio, loan loss recoveries and the release of a specific reserve on an impaired credit. Nonperforming assets increased $4.6 million, or 54.6% to $12.9 million at December 31, 2017 from $8.4 million a year earlier. The increase in nonperforming assets was due to nonaccrual loans, which increased but only represent 0.24% of the total loan portfolio. The Company had charge-offs of $0.9 million and $7.8 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company had recoveries of $2.3 million and $2.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Although the Company continues to record charge-offs, management believes that its credit quality outlook remains favorable and that the Company's allowance for loan and credit losses provides adequate coverage for probable loan and credit losses. The allowance for loan and credit losses to total loans was 1.21% and 1.13% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allowance for loan and credit losses to nonperforming loans was 482.4% and 1,010.4% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. It is possible management may determine a need to increase the allowance for loan and credit losses due to changes in the factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan and credit losses. Such determination could have an adverse effect in the level of future loan and credit loss provisions and the Company's earnings.\nInvestments\nThe investment portfolio is primarily composed of residential MBS explicitly (GNMA) and implicitly (FNMA and FHLMC) backed by the U.S. Government, with the majority of the portfolio either maturing or repricing within one to five years. The portfolio does not include any securities exposed to sub-prime mortgage loans. The investment portfolio also includes single-issuer TPS and corporate debt securities. The corporate debt securities portfolio primarily consists of senior and subordinated debentures issued by the financial services industry. None of the issuing institutions are in default nor have interest payments on the TPS been deferred. Our investment strategies are reviewed in meetings of the ALCO.\nCertain TPS and corporate debt securities held by the Company are subject to deduction from regulatory capital under the Corresponding Deduction Approach promulgated in Basel III.

Available for sale securities had a net unrealized gain of $2.7 million at December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company's available for sale securities in a temporary unrealized loss position of $0.3 million consisted primarily of TPS. The fair value of these securities is expected to recover as the securities approach their stated maturity or repricing date.\nOther investments consist primarily of FHLB stock required to support a borrowing base with the FHLB. FHLB stock holdings are largely dependent upon the Company's liquidity position. To the extent the need for wholesale funding increases or decreases, the Company may purchase additional or sell excess FHLB stock, respectively. During 2017, other investments decreased $1.2 million due to net redemptions of FHLB stock.\nThe following table sets forth the book value, maturity and approximate yield of the securities in our investment portfolio at December 31, 2017.

Intangible assets primarily represent client relationship lists. The Company recognized $0.6 million of intangible asset amortization during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Other than amortization, no other activity occurred in intangible assets during 2017 and 2016.\nBOLI. BOLI increased $1.4 million in 2017 to $55.0 million at December 31, 2017 due to growth in the cash surrender values of the underlying policies. BOLI increased $4.3 million in 2016 to $53.7 million at December 31, 2016. During 2016, the Company purchased additional policies of $3.2 million, had an increase of $1.3 million due to growth in the cash surrender values of the underlying policies and claims of $0.2 million\nDeferred Income Taxes, Net. Deferred income taxes, net decreased $6.8 million in 2017 to $13.1 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily from the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction in the federal tax rate from the TCJA. The remeasurement resulted in a $7.2 million reduction in the net deferred income tax asset. Deferred income taxes decreased $2.3 million in 2016 to $19.9 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily from the tax effect of the $7.4 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses in 2016. Deferred income taxes are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. See Note 11 - Income Taxes for additional discussion of income taxes and deferred tax items.\nOther Real Estate Owned. During 2016 and 2017, the Company had no OREO activity. At December 31, 2017, the Company held two properties, with one Colorado property comprising over 97% of the total OREO balance. The Company has entered into a contract to sell the Colorado property and does not expect a material gain or loss on the disposition.\nOther Assets. Other assets increased $0.3 million during 2017 to $20.1 million at December 31, 2017. In 2016, other assets increased $1.8 million during 2016 to $19.8 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to a receivable from the Company's landlord on reimbursement for leasehold improvements on the new executive office lease. The reimbursement has been accounted for as an incentive and is being recognized as a reduction to rent over the lease term.\nDeposits\nOur primary source of funds has historically been customer deposits. We offer a variety of accounts for depositors, which are designed to attract both short- and long-term deposits. These accounts include CDs, money market accounts, savings accounts, checking accounts, and individual retirement accounts. We believe we receive a large amount of noninterest-bearing deposits because we provide customers the option\nof paying for treasury management services in cash or by maintaining additional noninterest-bearing account balances. The Company's noninterest-bearing deposits represented 46% and 42% of total deposits at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest-bearing accounts earn interest at rates based on competitive market factors and our desire to increase or decrease certain types of maturities or deposits.\nThe Company views its reciprocal CDARS and ICS accounts as customer-related deposits. The CDARS and ICS programs are provided through a third party and are designed to provide full FDIC insurance on deposit amounts by exchanging or reciprocating larger depository relationships with other member banks. Depositor funds are broken into smaller amounts and placed with other banks that are members of the network. Each member bank issues deposit amounts at a level that the entire deposit is eligible for FDIC insurance. CDARS and ICS are technically brokered deposits; however, the Company considers the reciprocal deposits placed through these programs as core funding due to the customer relationship that generated the transaction and does not report the balances as brokered sources in its internal or external financial reports. The Company had balances of $344.9 million and $327.8 million in CDARS and ICS accounts at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe following tables present the average balances for each major category of deposits and the weighted average interest rates paid for interest-bearing deposits for the periods indicated.\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $32.9 million, a 5.7% decrease from $34.9 million in 2016. The decrease in net income was due to a $7.2 million increase in tax expense as a result of the TCJA. The increase to tax expense also reduced the return on average assets and equity. Return on average assets decreased to 0.87% for 2017 compared to 1.02% in 2016. Return on average shareholders' equity decreased to 10.27% from 12.15% in 2016.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $34.9 million, a 33.9% increase from $26.1 million in 2015. Return on average assets increased to 1.02% in 2016 compared to 0.83% a year earlier. Return on\naverage shareholders' equity also increased in 2016 to 12.15% from 8.77% in 2015. The financial improvement in 2016 was due to an increase in net interest income of $4.4 million and a decrease of $8.5 million in the provision for loan losses in 2016 over 2015.\nEarnings per common share on a diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, was $0.78, $0.84 and $0.62, respectively.\nNet Interest Income. The largest component of our net income is our net interest income. NII is the difference between interest income, principally from loans and investment securities, and interest expense, principally on customer deposits and borrowings. Changes in NII result from changes in volume, net interest spread and net interest margin. Volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin refers to NII divided by average interest-earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe majority of our assets are interest-earning and our liabilities are interest-bearing. Accordingly, changes in interest rates may impact our net interest margin. The FOMC uses the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate used by banks to lend to each other, to influence interest rates and the national economy. Changes in the federal funds rate have a direct correlation to changes in one month Libor and the the prime rate, the underlying indeces for most of the floating-rate loans issued by the Company. The target federal funds rate was held at a range of 0-25 basis points between December 2008 and December 2015. On December 17, 2015, the FOMC increased the target rate to 25-50 basis points, the first increase since June 2006. The target rate was increased another 100 basis points between 2016-2017 and is at a range of 125-150 basis at December 31, 2017. As the Company is asset sensitive, low rates negatively impact the Company's earnings and NIM and the Company benefits as the target rate increases.\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, certain information related to our average asset and liability structure and our average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities. Such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. NII and NIM are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis to recognize the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. The taxable-equivalent NII and NIM in the following table were computed using the applicable state tax rate and a 35.0% federal tax rate. Beginning in 2018, the taxable-equivalent NII and NIM\nwill be calculated using a 21.0% federal tax rate due to the enactment of the TCJA. Assuming no other changes, NII and NIM will be reduced in future periods due to the decrease in the federal income tax rate.\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

interest-earning assets increased $316.4 million to $3.63 billion at December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase of $252.6 million in the loan portfolio and $74.2 million in the investment portfolio. Taxable-equivalent net interest income grew $16.0 million due to the growth in the loan portfolio. The yield on earning assets increased 11 basis points, from 4.09% to 4.20% in 2017, primarily due to a 12 basis point increase in the yield on the loan portfolio.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $143.7 million during 2017 to $2.03 billion. The increase was due to a $106.1 million increase in interest-bearing deposits and a $37.6 million increase in Customer Repurchases and short-term borrowings. The average cost of liabilities was 0.62% in both 2017 and 2016. Although the cost of short-term borrowings increased 53 basis points in 2017 due to the increase in the target federal funds rate, the overall cost of deposits remained stable at 13 basis points in both 2017 and 2016.\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $268.2 million to $3.31 billion at December 31, 2016. The loan portfolio increased $275.8 million in 2016, while the investment portfolio declined $15.9 million, the sixth consecutive year the investment portfolio has declined. Taxable-equivalent net interest income grew $6.2 million due to the growth in interest-earning assets, primarily in the loan portfolio. In addition, net interest income included 366 days in 2016 due to the leap year, compared to 365 days in 2015. The yield on earning assets declined nine basis points, from 4.18% to 4.09% in 2016, primarily due to a lower yield on the loan portfolio. In October 2016, the Company entered into two interest-rate swaps to hedge the cash flows on a portion of its LIBOR-based loan portfolio. The swaps have a weighted average term of six years and a combined notional value of $100.0 million. The Company pays a variable rate based on 1-month LIBOR and receives a weighted average fixed-rate of 1.20%.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $123.4 million during 2016 to $1.88 billion. The increase was due to an $83.8 million increase in interest-bearing deposits and a $39.6 million net increase in Customer Repurchases and short/long-term borrowings. The average cost of liabilities increased in 2016, to 0.62%, from 0.55% in 2015. The increase in the yield on interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the increase in the target federal funds rate in December 2015, which increased short-term borrowing costs in 2016.\nThe Company has executed a series of interest-rate swap transactions designated as cash flow hedges. The swaps fix the effective interest rate for payments due on the junior subordinated debentures with the objective of reducing the Company's exposure to adverse changes in cash flows relating to payments on its LIBOR-\nbased floating rate debt. The weighted average interest rate paid (fixed-rate) was 5.44%, 5.44% and 5.48% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decline in the rate during 2016 was due to the maturity of a swap in early 2015 with a fixed-rate of 6.04% that was replaced with a new swap with a fixed-rate of 4.99%. The remaining contractual maturities of the swaps vary between 2 and 6 years. Certain terms of the cash flow hedges are as follows:\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNotional amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFixed-rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTermination date\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHedged item - Junior subordinated debentures issued by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCoBiz Statutory Trust I\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.99\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\nMarch 17, 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCoBiz Capital Trust II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n30,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.99\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\nApril 23, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCoBiz Capital Trust III\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.02\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\nMarch 30, 2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision and Allowance for Loan Losses.

The increase in the provision for loan losses in 2017 was primarily due to loan growth, an additional allowance segmentation on a pool of investor office loans within the Denver market and an increase in classified loans. Partially offsetting these items were net recoveries of $1.36 million.\nThe decrease in the provision for loan losses in 2016 was primarily due to the reversal of a $2.3 million specific reserve on an impaired credit, recoveries of $2.5 million and a decrease in multi-family lending, a category with a higher reserve allocation. Partially offsetting these items were loan growth and a $6.8 million increase in classified loans in 2016.\nNonperforming loans to total loans were 0.25%, 0.11%, and 0.60% at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Deposit service charges primarily consist of fees earned from our treasury management services. Customers are given the option to pay for these services in cash or by offsetting the fees for these services against an earnings credit that is given for maintaining noninterest-bearing deposits. Fees earned from treasury management services will fluctuate based on the number of customers using the services and from changes in U.S. Treasury rates which are used as a benchmark for the earnings credit rate. Other miscellaneous deposit charges are transactional by nature and may not be consistent period over period. As the earnings credit rate increases, the amount of cash fees paid for service charges decreases. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company evaluated and increased the rates assessed for treasury management services which increased 2017 income.\nInvestment Advisory Income. Investment advisory income increased $0.5 million or 8.9% to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, advisory income decreased $0.1 million or 2.0% to $5.7 million compared to 2015. Revenue from this source is generally a function of the value of Assets Under Management (AUM) on the last day of each quarter. Discretionary AUM at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $974.3 million and $844.5 million, respectively. Average AUM was $908.7 million, $831.8 million and $876.0, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenue from investment advisory income benefits from market appreciation and is negatively impacted from market depreciation.\nInsurance Income. Insurance income is derived from two main areas: benefits consulting and P&C. Revenue from benefits consulting and P&C are recurring revenue sources as policies and contracts generally renew or rewrite on an annual or more frequent basis. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, insurance revenue was composed of the following:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBenefits consulting\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n62.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n54.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProperty and casualty\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGrowth in benefits consulting was the primary cause of the $0.6 million increase in insurance income in 2017. In 2015 and 2016, the average P&C rate for the industry declined. As our revenue is typically derived as percentage of the premium, this negatively impacted revenue. At the same time, the Company's benefits consulting division has continued to grow. The combination of these two factors has caused the shift in the percentage of revenue in the table above.\nOther Income. Other income is composed of changes in the cash surrender value of BOLI, earnings on other investments, loan and commitment fees, merchant and bankcard fees, customer swap fees, wire transfer fees, foreign exchange fees and safe deposit income.\nOther income decreased $1.8 million to $8.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a $2.9 million increase to $9.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in 2017 is due to a $1.2 million decrease in income from other investments and a $0.5 million decrease in customer swap fees. Other investments consist primarily of funds licensed as Small Business Investment Companies. The Company's income from these funds will vary based on transactions occurring within the funds.\nOther income increased $2.9 million to $9.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a $1.5 million increase to $6.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in 2016 is due to a $1.2 million increase in income from other investments and a $1.0 million increase in customer swap fees.\nNoninterest Expense. The following table presents noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNONINTEREST EXPENSES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSalaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n75,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n71,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n69,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOccupancy expenses, premises and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(301)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n14.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAmortization of intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFDIC and other assessments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(382)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(22.6)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(121)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6.7)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet gain on securities, other assets and other real estate owned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(507)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(121)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(369)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(386)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(319.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal noninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n107,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n105,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n100,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis was 62.46% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 66.8% and 67.9% for 2016 and 2015, respectively (see non-GAAP reconciliation included in\nItem 6. Selected Financial Data). The efficiency ratio is a measure of the Company's overhead, measuring the percentage of each dollar of income that is paid in operating expenses. In 2017 the Company was successful in improving its operating leverage by growing net interest income while limiting the growth in expenses. The Company maintains its goal of reducing the efficiency ratio over the next few years and is committed to exploring cost-reduction strategies. However, assuming no other changes, the TCJA will cause the efficiency ratio to increase in 2018 due to the reduction in taxable-equivalent net interest income discussed above. Further increases in the federal funds target rate by the FOMC would benefit the Company's net interest income and efficiency ratio.\nSalaries and Employee Benefits. The Company's full-time equivalent employee base at the end of 2017 was 538 compared to 533 in 2016.\nSalaries and employee benefits increased $3.6 million or 5.1% during the year ended December 31, 2017. Contributing to the increase in 2017 was a $2.1 million increase in salaries and a $1.4 million increase in bonus expense. Salaries increased due to the annual cost of living and merit increases effective in the second quarter of 2017 and the increase in full-time equivalent employees.\nSalaries and employee benefits increased $1.9 million or 2.8% during the year ended December 31, 2016. Contributing to the increase in 2016 was a $0.9 million increase in salaries and commission expense, $0.6 million increase in 401(k) matching expense and a $0.5 million increase in insurance benefits. Salaries were also impacted by the annual cost of living and merit increases effective in the second quarter of 2016, offset by a decrease in severance expense in 2016. The Company has a 401(k) matching program that is based on the overall profitability of the Company. Based on the Company's financial performance in 2016, an additional match of $0.5 million was made in 2016 that was not made in 2015. The Company is partially self-insured on its medical and dental programs. Insurance benefits will vary based on participant claims. In 2016, the Company's participants experienced several large claims that increased our insurance expense.\nIncluded in salaries and employee benefits is expense related to share-based compensation used to retain existing employees and to recruit new employees. The Company expects to continue using share-based compensation in the future as it is considered an important part of overall compensation. Costs associated with the plan are influenced by the number of participants in the Company's stock bonus pool and the proportion of incentive compensation paid in cash versus stock.\nOccupancy Expenses, Premises and Equipment. Occupancy expenses consist primarily of rent, utilities, property taxes, insurance, depreciation and information systems maintenance. Occupancy costs decreased $0.3 million or 2.0% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. In January 2016, the Company signed a new lease agreement for its principal executive offices and recognized seven months of expense related to the lease in 2016, in addition to a full year of expense on the former principal executive office lease that terminated on December 31, 2016. The transition cost of maintaining leases on two locations did not reocurr in 2017. Occupancy costs increased $1.9 million or 14.4% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2016 was due to the cost of maintaining leases on two locations for part of 2016.\nFDIC and Other Assessments. FDIC and other assessments consist of premiums paid by the FDIC-insured institutions and by Colorado chartered banks. The assessments by the FDIC and the Colorado Division of Banking are based on statutory and risk classification factors. The decrease in 2017 and 2016 was due to a statutory reduction in assessment rates in the second half of 2016.\nNet Gain on Securities, Other Assets and Other Real Estate Owned. The Company recognized gains on securities, other assets and OREO of $0.5 million, $0.1 million and $0.4 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net gains on securities for the years presented were primarily from securities called/redeemed.\nOther Expense. Other operating expenses increased $0.1 million and $1.1 million, in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2016 was partially due to an increase in professional service costs related to\nthe Company's process and efficiency evaluations conducted in 2016. The Company has continued to see an increase in expenses in this area due to ongoing regulatory compliance and information technology projects.\nFederal Income Taxes. The effective tax rate was 38.4%, 25.9%, and 26.9% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 was due to a $7.2 million increase to tax expense from the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the TCJA. The decrease in the corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% is expected to reduce the Company's effective tax rate in 2018.\nPermanent differences, primarily arising from changes in the cash surrender value of BOLI and tax-exempt income are the primary activities impacting the effective tax rate in each year.\nSegment Results\nThe Company has three segments: Commercial Banking, Fee-Based Lines, and Corporate Support and Other.

Volume increases in our interest earning assets and an increase in yield were the primary reasons for the increase in net interest income. Average loans increased $252.6 million and the yield on interest-earning assets increased 11 basis points in 2017. The growth in the loan portfolio also resulted in an increase to our provision for loan losses, which increased $5.2 million in 2017 over 2016. Noninterest expense decreased $4.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016, partially due to a decline in occupancy costs associated with the Company's move to a new headquarters location in 2016. In addition, certain centralized expenses included in the Commercial Banking segment in 2016 were moved to the Corporate Support segment in 2017. The provision for income taxes increased $9.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher pre-tax income and the impact of the TCJA.\nThe Commercial Banking segment reported net income of $40.2 million and $29.8 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. Volume increases in our interest earning assets was the primary reason for the increase in net interest income. Average loans were $275.8 million higher in 2016 than in 2015, which muted the effect of lower yields on interest-earning assets. Asset quality improvements and recoveries on charged-off loans resulted in a loan loss provision reversal of $1.8 million. Noninterest income grew in 2016, primarily due to $1.2 million in fees generated from the sale of interest rate swaps.\nFee-Based Lines.\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFee-Based Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome Statement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(12)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(23)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(42)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNoninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNoninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(174)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n241.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(271)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(42.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income before management fees and overhead allocations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(398)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(46.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(71)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nManagement fees and overhead allocations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(404)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(24.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(397)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,208)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(542)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(666)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(122.9)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, the Company ceased operations of GMB, a provider of investment banking services that was a component of the Fee-Based Lines segment. The decision was based in part by increasing regulatory compliance costs related to maintaining GMB's broker-dealer license and earnings volatility which was highly dependent on deal volume. Results for GMB for 2015 have been reclassified as discontinued operations. See Note 2 - Discontinued Operations for additional discussion.\nNet loss in the Fee-Based Lines segment decreased $0.8 million in 2017 compared to 2016. An increase in noninterest income of $1.1 million, while noninterest expense remained relatively flat, was the primary reason for the improvement. The increase in tax expense from the TCJA also impacted the Fee-Based Lines, increasing tax expense by $0.5 million. Absent the increase in tax expense from the TCJA, the segment would have reported a positive net income.\nNet loss in the Fee-Based Lines segment increased $0.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Lower investment advisory and insurance revenue coupled with higher salary and benefit costs contributed to the net loss in 2016. At December 31, 2016, AUM decreased $14.7 million during 2016 to $844.5 million from $859.2 million at the end of 2015. Average AUM in 2016 was $831.8 million compared to $876.0 million in 2015. Noninterest expense in the segment is predominately compensation-related, which is primarily variable and directly related to revenue. However, as the Company invests in new production staff, compensation as a percentage of revenue for those employees is higher in the earlier years until those new producers build a revenue base.\nCorporate Support and Other.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCorporate Support and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome Statement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6,994)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6,902)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4,231)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(92)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,671)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(63.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(140)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(285)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(417)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNoninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,039)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(56.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNoninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n56,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n49,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBenefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(22,657)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(20,796)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(18,716)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,861)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8.9)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,080)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet loss before management fees and overhead allocations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(39,938)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(33,643)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(29,734)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,295)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(18.7)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,909)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(13.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nManagement fees and overhead allocations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(34,251)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(29,585)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(26,559)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,666)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(15.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,026)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(5,687)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4,058)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(3,175)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,629)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(40.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(883)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(27.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Corporate Support and Other segment consists of activities of the Parent; non-production, back-office support operations; and eliminating transactions in consolidation. Non-production, back-office operations include human resources, accounting and finance, audit and compliance, information technology, Special Assets Group, and loan and deposit operations. The Company has a process for allocating these support\noperations back to the production lines based on an internal allocation methodology that is updated annually. Noninterest expense includes salaries and benefits of employees of the Parent and support functions as well as the nonemployee overhead operating costs not directly associated with another segment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the segment reported a net loss of $5.7 million, an increase of $1.6 million from 2016. Lower noninterest income was due to the earnings on the Company's investments in mezzanine funds, which decreased in 2017 compared to 2016. Continued investment in the operational redesign of the Company's credit process, business intelligence and other consulting services resulted in an increase in noninterest expense during 2017.\nThe segment reported a net loss of $4.1 million in 2016 compared to a net loss of $3.2 million in the prior year. Lower net interest income was the result of additional interest expense of $1.7 million in 2016 relating to the Notes and lower interest income due to a prior-year recapture of $1.0 million of interest income on problem loan resolutions. Higher salary, health insurance, facility rents and service contract costs resulted in an increase in noninterest expense during 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses relates to a portfolio of loans purchased by the Parent from the Bank. This portfolio has steadily decreased since the 2009 purchase due to loan repayments and collateral sales. The declining balance of the portfolio and the overall asset quality improvement has contributed to the trend of declining provision for loan losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity refers to the Company's ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet financial obligations to its customers and shareholders in order to fund loans, to respond to deposit outflows and to cover operating expenses. Maintaining a level of liquid funds through asset/liability management seeks to ensure that these needs are met at a reasonable cost. Liquidity is essential to compensate for fluctuations in the balance sheet and provide funds for growth and normal operating expenditures. Sources of funds include customer deposits, scheduled amortization of loans, loan prepayments, scheduled maturities and calls of investments and prepayments from mortgage-backed securities. Liquidity needs may also be met by deposit growth, converting assets into cash, raising funds in the brokered CD market or borrowing using lines of credit with correspondent banks, the FHLB or the FRB. Longer-term liquidity needs may be met by selling securities available for sale or raising additional capital.\nLiquidity management is the process by which the Company manages the continuing flow of funds necessary to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. The objective of liquidity management is to ensure the Company has the ability to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to allow us to sustain our operations. These funding commitments include withdrawals by depositors, credit commitments to borrowers, shareholder dividends, debt payments, expenses of our operations and capital expenditures. Liquidity is monitored and closely managed by ALCO, a group of senior officers from the lending, deposit gathering, finance and treasury areas. ALCO's primary responsibilities are to ensure the necessary level of funds are available for normal operations as well as maintain a contingency funding policy to ensure that liquidity stress events are quickly identified and management plans are in place to respond. This is accomplished through the use of policies which establish limits and require measurements to monitor liquidity trends, including management reporting that identifies the amounts and costs of all available funding sources.\nThe Company's current liquidity position is expected to be more than adequate to fund expected asset growth. Historically, our primary source of funds has been customer deposits. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments - which are influenced by fluctuations in the general level of interest rates, returns available on other investments, competition, economic conditions, and other factors - are less predictable.\nLiquidity from asset categories is provided through cash and interest-bearing deposits with other banks, which totaled $80.2 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $96.1 million at December 31, 2016. Additional asset liquidity sources include principal and interest payments from securities in the Company's investment portfolio and loan portfolio. Liability liquidity sources include attracting deposits at competitive rates and maintaining wholesale borrowing (short-term borrowings and brokered CDs) credit relationships.\nThe Company's loan to core deposit ratio increased to 97.5% at December 31, 2017, from 96.8% at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $77.6 million and $106.2 million in outstanding wholesale borrowings, respectively. Average wholesale borrowings were $108.7 million and $84.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company uses various forms of short-term borrowings for cash management and liquidity purposes, regularly accessing its federal funds and FHLB lines to manage its daily cash position. At December 31, 2017, the Bank has approved federal funds purchase lines with eight correspondent banks with an aggregate credit line of $180.0 million. The Bank also has a line of credit from the FHLB that is limited by the amount of eligible collateral available to secure it and the Company's investment in FHLB stock. Borrowings under the FHLB line are required to be secured by unpledged securities and qualifying loans. Borrowings may also be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity or repricing intervals of assets.\nAvailable funding through correspondent lines and the FHLB at December 31, 2017, totaled $709.2 million or 19.2% of the Company's earning assets. Available funding consisted of $180.0 million of federal fund lines and $529.2 million in secured FHLB borrowing capacity. Access to funding through correspondent lines is dependent upon the cash position of the correspondent banks and there may be times when certain lines are not available. In addition, certain lines require a one day rest period after a specified number of consecutive days of accessing the lines. The Company believes it has sufficient borrowing capacity and diversity in correspondent banks to meet its needs.\nAt the holding company level, our primary sources of funds are dividends paid from the Bank and fee-based subsidiaries, management fees assessed to the Bank and the Fee-Based Lines, proceeds from the issuance of common stock, and other capital markets activity. The main use of this liquidity is the quarterly payment of dividends on our common stock, quarterly interest payments on the subordinated debentures and notes payable, payments for mergers and acquisitions activity, and payments for the salaries and benefits for the employees of the holding company.\nThe Company also maintains a revolving line of credit for an aggregate amount of up to $20.0 million, all of which was available at December 31, 2017. The line of credit has a one year term and matures in May 2018. Funds drawn will be used for general corporate purposes and backup liquidity.\nThe approval of the Colorado State Banking Board is required prior to the declaration of any dividend by the Bank if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits for the preceding two years. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 provides that the Bank cannot pay a dividend if it will cause the Bank to be undercapitalized.\u201d At December 31, 2017, the Bank was not otherwise restricted in its ability to pay dividends to the holding company. The Company's ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends upon the availability of dividends from the Bank, earnings from its Fee-Based Lines, and upon the Company's compliance with the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (see Note 17 - Regulatory Matters). The holding company has a liquidity policy that requires the maintenance of at least 18 months of liquidity on the balance sheet based on projected cash usages, exclusive of dividends from the Bank. At December 31, 2017, the Company had a liquidity position that exceeds the policy limit, and we believe the Company has the ability to continue paying dividends.\nNet loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.1 million, which reasonably approximated the cash flows of those operations not separately stated in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows.\nShareholders' equity was $329.3 million and $302.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Changes in shareholders' equity are due to the following:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBeginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n302,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n273,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOptions and restricted stock, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDividends paid-common\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8,785)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7,858)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther comprehensive loss, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(707)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,717)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEnding balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n329,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n302,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents, expected cash flows from continuing operations together with alternative sources of funding are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital, loan originations, capital expenditures and other obligations for at least the next 12 months. We continually monitor existing and alternative financing sources to support our capital and liquidity needs, including but not limited to, debt issuance, common stock issuance and deposit funding sources. Based on our current financial condition and our results of operations, we believe the Company will be able to sustain its ability to raise adequate capital through one or more of these financing sources.\nWe are subject to minimum risk-based capital limitations as set forth by federal banking regulations at both the consolidated Company level and the Bank level. Under the risk-based capital guidelines, different categories of assets, including certain off-balance sheet items, such as loan commitments in excess of one year and letters of credit, are assigned different risk weights, based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset. These risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk-weighted\u201d asset base. For purposes of the risk-based capital guidelines, total capital is defined as the sum of Common Equity Tier 1,\u201d Additional Tier 1\u201d and Tier 2\u201d capital elements. Common Equity Tier 1 consists of common stock, related surplus and retained earnings. Additional Tier 1 capital includes, with certain restrictions, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, certain grandfathered regulatory capital instruments and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries. Tier 2 capital includes, with certain limitations, perpetual preferred stock not included in Tier 1 capital, subordinated debt, certain maturing capital instruments, and the allowance for loan and credit losses.\nBeginning in 2016, the CCB requirement became effective for banking organizations. The CCB is designed to establish a capital range above minimum requirements to insulate banks from periods of stress and discourage unacceptable practices that may shift certain risks from an organization's shareholders to its depositors. When the capital buffer is breached, an organization's ability to pay dividends, execute share repurchases and make discretionary bonus payments may be limited to varying degrees depending on the severity of the breach. When fully phased-in in 2019, the CCB adds a 2.5% capital requirement above existing regulatory minimum ratios. At December 31, 2017, the Bank and Holding Company maintained capital buffers in excess of the fully phased-in requirements and were not subject to additional constraints on distributions, share repurchases or discretionary bonus payments beyond existing limits. At December 31, 2017, the Bank was well-capitalized with all capital ratios exceeding the well-capitalized requirement.\nSee Note 17 - Regulatory Matters for additional capital ratio disclosure. In order to comply with the regulatory capital constraints, the Company and its Board of Directors constantly monitor the capital level and its anticipated needs based on the Company's growth. The Company has identified sources of additional capital that could be used if needed, and monitors the costs and benefits of these sources, which include both the public and private markets.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements do not reflect various off-balance sheet commitments that are made in the normal course of business, which may involve some liquidity risk. Off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in the following Contractual Obligations and Commitments section. The Company has commitments to extend credit under lines of credit and stand-by letters of credit. The Company has also committed to investing in certain partnerships. See the following section of this report and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on these commitments.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nSummarized below are the Company's contractual obligations (excluding deposit liabilities) to make future payments at December 31, 2017:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter one but\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter three\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWithin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nwithin three\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nbut within\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\none year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfive years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfive years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFederal funds purchased (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFHLB overnight funds purchased (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n73,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n73,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRepurchase agreements (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n52,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n52,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n30,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt obligations (2)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n141,939 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n172,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n143,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n153,937 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n333,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest on these obligations has been excluded due to the short-term nature of the instruments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPrincipal repayment of the $72.2 million in junior subordinated debentures is assumed to be at the contractual maturity, currently beyond five years.

These financial instruments include legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet. Credit risk is the principal risk associated with these instruments. The contractual amounts of these instruments represent the amount of credit risk should the instruments be fully drawn upon and the customer defaults.\nTo control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit, the Company uses the same credit quality, collateral policies and monitoring controls in making commitments and letters of credit as it does with its lending activities. The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation.\nLegally binding commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Standby letters of credit obligate the Company to meet certain financial obligations of its customers if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the customers are unable to do so. The financial standby letters of credit issued by the Company are irrevocable. Payment is only guaranteed under these letters of credit upon the borrower's failure to perform its obligations to the beneficiary.\nApproximately $52.8 million of total commitments at December 31, 2017 represent commitments to extend credit at fixed-rates of interest, which exposes the Company to some degree of interest rate risk.\nThe Company has also entered into interest-rate swap agreements under which it is required to either receive or pay cash to a counterparty depending on changes in interest rates. The interest-rate swaps are carried at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates at the balance sheet date. Interest-rate swaps recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017, do not represent amounts that will ultimately be received or paid under the contract and are therefore excluded from the table above.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs. Unlike most retail or manufacturing companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution such as the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, the impact of interest rates on a financial institution's performance is generally greater than the impact of inflation. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or to the same extent, as the prices of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates. Over short periods of time, interest rates may not move in the same direction, or at the same magnitude, as inflation.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCompany Overview. The Company is a financial holding company that offers a broad array of financial service products to its target market of professionals, small and medium-sized businesses, and high-net-worth individuals. Our principal operating segments are Commercial Banking and Fee-Based Lines.\nFrom December 31, 1995, the first complete fiscal year under the current management team, to December 31, 2017, our organization has grown from a bank holding company with two bank locations and total assets of $160.4 million to a diversified financial services holding company with 15 bank locations and total assets of $3.8 billion. We have also expanded into wealth and insurance services. The Company has a well-capitalized balance sheet that includes common equity, subordinated notes payable and subordinated debentures.\nEarnings are derived primarily from our net interest income, which is interest income less interest expense, and our noninterest income earned from Fee-Based Lines and banking service fees, offset by noninterest expense. As the majority of our assets are interest-earning and our liabilities are interest-bearing, changes in\ninterest rates impact our net interest margin, the largest component of our operating revenue (which is defined as net interest income plus noninterest income). We manage our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our operating results. We also have focused on reducing our dependency on our net interest margin by increasing our noninterest income.\nWe concentrate on developing an organization with personnel, management systems and products and services that will allow us to compete effectively and position us for growth. Although we strive to minimize costs that do not impact customer service, we continue to invest in systems and business production personnel to strengthen our future growth prospects.\nThe Company is focused on achieving financial objectives as part of its one to three year plan that are intended to enable the Company to achieve double-digit growth in earnings per share. We anticipate that achieving these objectives, coupled with maintaining our asset quality, will enable us to enhance shareholder return.\nSteps taken to realize progress on our financial objectives include: aligning production employee variable compensation with these objectives; strengthening internal networking to enhance synergies between product lines within the Company; formalizing a leadership development program; structuring management roles to provide more accountability; setting clear expectations for all producers and continuing to work with producers who are not meeting their goals; and building customer relationships.\nTo further our goal of limiting growth in noninterest expense, the Company conducted a comprehensive review of its staffing levels and expenditures in each functional area to identify areas for improvement. The Company intends to continually monitor incremental improvement and new areas for emphasis. The Company also completed a thorough analysis of its loan origination and credit underwriting process. Based on this review, the Company implemented procedural changes and clarified employee responsibilities in 2017, which we believe will improve operational efficiencies and improve customer satisfaction and employee morale. Finally, the Company has initiated an ongoing review of its facility strategy with a goal of servicing its customer base in a cost-effective manner. This has resulted in the closure of three bank locations, the combination of two bank locations in downtown Denver into one location, and the relocation of the Company's principal executive offices. As a result of the relocation of our principal executive offices, all of our client-facing employees in the downtown Denver area are in one location for the first time. The Company believes this will further strengthen internal synergies and will provide a broader platform to service the financial needs of its customers.\nAs discussed in Item 1. Business\u201d and Note 2 - Discontinued Operations, the Company ceased the operations of its investment banking division in the first quarter of 2015. The results of operations related to the investment banking division in 2015 have been reported as discontinued operations. The prior period disclosures in the following table have been adjusted to conform to the new presentation.\nInternally, management measures the contribution of the Fee-Based Lines before parent company management fees and overhead allocations. The Company believes this to be a more useful measurement as centralized administration expenses and overhead are generally not impacted by the Fee-Based Lines, but are most affected by the operations of the Bank. While the Company allocates a portion of the costs related to shared resources to the Fee-Based Lines, we measure their profitability based on a pre-allocation basis as it approximates the operating cash flow generated by the segment. A description of each segment is provided in Note 19 - Segments.\nCertain key metrics of our segments at or for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCorporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSupport\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFee-Based\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBanking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating revenue (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n151,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n19,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6,205)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n164,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n39,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(397)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(5,687)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n32,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating revenue (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n137,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(5,074)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n150,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n40,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,208)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4,058)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n34,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating revenue (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n127,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,870)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n142,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(542)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(3,175)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n26,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Net interest income plus noninterest income. \nNoted below are some of the significant financial performance measures and operational results for 2017 and 2016:\nTable 36: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial Banking operating revenue increased 10.5% in 2017 to $151.4 million, while net income decreased 2.9% to $39.0 million.

For a discussion of the segments included in our principal activities and for certain financial information for each segment, see Segments\u201d discussed below and Note 19 - Segments.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. In making those critical accounting estimates, we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate. Different estimates we could reasonably have used, or changes in the assumptions that could occur, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectability of loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nIn determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, we analyze the various components of the loan portfolio, including impaired loans, on an individual basis. When analyzing the adequacy, we segment the loan portfolio into components with similar characteristics, such as risk classification, past due status, type of loan, industry or collateral. We have a systematic process to evaluate individual loans and pools of loans within our loan portfolio. We maintain a loan grading system whereby each loan is assigned a grade between 1 and 8, with 1 representing the highest quality credit, 7 representing a loan where collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable, and 8 representing a loss that has been or will be charged-off. Loans that are graded 5 or lower are categorized as non-classified credits, while loans graded 6 and higher are categorized as classified credits that have a higher risk of loss. Grades are assigned based upon the degree of risk associated with repayment of a loan in the normal course of business pursuant to the original terms.\nDifferences between the actual credit outcome of a loan and the risk assessment made by the Company could negatively impact the Company's earnings by requiring additional provision for loan losses. As a hypothetical example, if $25.0 million of grade 3, non-classified loans were downgraded as classified at the same historical loss factor of existing classified loans, an additional $1.5 million of provision for loan losses would be required. Conversely, a $25.0 million decrease in classified loans would result in a $1.5 million reversal of provision for loan losses.\nSee Note 4 - Loans for further discussion on management's methodology.\nFair Value\nThe Company has adopted ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), as it applies to financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under ASC 820 as the exchange price that would be received for an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nAs a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). Fair value may be used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities such as available for sale securities and derivatives in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting. Similarly, fair value may be used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets or liabilities, such as impaired loans. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, the Company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions in accordance with ASC 820 to determine the instrument's fair value. At December 31, 2017, $169.6 million of total assets, consisting of $166.8 million in available for sale securities and $2.8 million in derivative instruments, represented assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2016, $136.3 million of total assets, consisting of $133.0 million in available for sale securities and $3.3 million in derivative instruments, represented assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $9.1 million of single-issuer trust preferred securities (TPS) classified as Level 3. The fair value of these TPS is determined using broker-dealer quotes and trade data that may not be current. These TPS are classified as Level 3 due to lack of current market data and their illiquid nature. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, $9.6 million and $11.2 million, respectively, of total liabilities represented derivative instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consisted of impaired loans and OREO totaling $3.8 million and $5.4 million, at December 31, 2017. Impaired loans and OREO were $1.4 million and $5.4 million at December 31, 2016. For additional information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities see Note 18 - Fair Value Measurements.\nDeferred Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance may be established. We consider the determination of this valuation allowance to be a critical accounting policy because of the need to exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets, including projections of future taxable income. These judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. See Note 11 - Income Taxes for additional information. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required in the future if the amounts of taxes recoverable through loss carry backs decline, if we project lower levels of future taxable income, or we project lower levels of tax planning strategies. Such valuation allowance would be established through a charge to income tax expense that would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe also have other policies that we consider to be significant accounting policies; however, these policies, which are disclosed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.\nFinancial Condition\nThe Company had total assets of $3.8 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to total assets of $3.6 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion at December 31, 2016. The following\nsections address the specific components of the balance sheets and significant matters relating to those components at and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nLending Activities\nGeneral. We provide a broad range of lending services, including commercial loans, commercial and residential real estate construction loans, commercial and residential real estate-mortgage loans, consumer loans, revolving lines of credit, and tax-exempt financing. Our primary lending focus is commercial and real estate lending to small and medium-sized businesses with annual sales of $5.0 million to $75.0 million, and businesses and individuals with borrowing requirements of $250,000 to $15.0 million. At December 31, 2017, substantially all of our outstanding loans were to customers within Colorado and Arizona. Interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk, maturity, underwriting and servicing costs, principal amount, and extent of other banking relationships with the customer. Interest rates are further subject to competitive pressures, money market rates, availability of funds, and government regulations. See Net Interest Income\u201d for an analysis of the interest rates on our loans.\nCredit Procedures and Review. We address credit risk through internal credit policies and procedures, including underwriting criteria, officer and customer lending limits, a multi-layered loan approval process for larger loans, periodic document examination, justification for any exceptions to credit policies, loan review and concentration monitoring. In response to the last economic downturn, the Company expanded the resources of the credit and loan review departments to provide for a more proactive identification and management of problem credits. In addition, we provide ongoing loan officer training and review. We have a continuous loan review process designed to promote early identification of credit quality problems, assisted by dedicated Senior Credit Officers that support each geographic market and major loan class. All loan officers are charged with the responsibility of reviewing, at least on a monthly basis, all past due loans in their respective portfolios. In addition, the credit administration department establishes a watch list of loans to be reviewed by the Board of Directors of the Bank. The loan portfolio is also monitored regularly by a loan review department that reports to an executive vice president of the Company and submits reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the credit administration department.\nThe Company's credit approval process is as follows:\n \u00b7 Internal lending limits for loans extended to a single borrower are established by the Board of Directors of the Bank. \n \u00b7 Credits equal to the Bank's internal lending limit require two signatures from either the Vice-Chairman of the Bank, Chief Credit Officer or a Bank President/Senior Credit Officer. \n \u00b7 Loan authority of officers is approved by the Bank's Board of Directors, reviewed annually and updated according to the growth of the Bank. The Board of Directors may designate different approval authorities depending on loan grade, loan type, and whether the loan is a new credit or renewal of credit. \n \u00b7 The Board of Directors of the Bank designates the approval authority of the loan committee. The presence of two of the following is required for any committee loan approval: Vice-Chairman of the Bank, Chief Credit Officer or a Market President. A quorum requires at least three designated committee members to be in attendance. \n \u00b7 Loan officers are permitted within a 12-month period to approve up to $0.2 million in new credit per customer aggregate loan relationship. In cases where the aggregate credit size exceeds the loan credit officer's individual authority, the Bank President may approve the additional credit. \nComposition of Loan Portfolio.

Loans in the Arizona and Colorado markets increased $62.1 million and $149.4 million, respectively from December 31, 2016.\nIn 2017, the Construction & land category increased $90.0 million and Real estate - mortgage loans increased $78.4 million, contributing 80.0% of the loan growth on a combined basis. In 2016, the Real estate - mortgage loan category contributed 65.9% of the loan portfolio growth, increasing $154.9 million. Other loan categories with modest growth in 2016 included Commercial ($42.4 million), Consumer ($13.7 million), and Other ($50.8 million) loans, while Construction & land declined $26.8 million.\nUnder state law, the aggregate amount of loans we can make to one borrower is generally limited to 15% of our unimpaired capital, surplus, undivided profits and allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 2017, our individual legal lending limit was $66.4 million. The Bank's Board of Directors has established an internal lending limit of $15.0 million for normal credit extensions and $20.0 million for the highest rated credits. To accommodate customers whose financing needs exceed our internal lending limits and to address portfolio concentration concerns, we may sell loan participations to outside participants. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the outstanding balance of loan participations sold by us was $20.7 million and $15.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had loan participations purchased from other banks totaling $130.8 million and $118.3 million, respectively. We use the same analysis in deciding whether to purchase a participation in a loan as we would in deciding whether to originate the same loan.\nDue to the nature of our business as a commercial banking institution, our lending relationships are typically larger than those of a retail bank. The following table describes the number of relationships and the percentage of the dollar value of the loan portfolio by the size of the credit relationship.\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAt December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNumber of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNumber of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNumber of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCredit Relationships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nrelationships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nportfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nrelationships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nportfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nrelationships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nportfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGreater than $6.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n35.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$3.0 million to $6.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$1.0 million to $3.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n$0.5 million to $1.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLess than $0.5 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n9.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n3,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n4,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n4,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of the loan relationships exceeding $3.0 million are in our real estate and commercial portfolios. At December 31, 2017 the Company had loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings in the amount of $454.3 million and loans to the healthcare and social assistance industry in the amount of $334.3 million that exceeded 10% of total loans. There were no other concentrations in excess of 10% of the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2017. The Company may be subject to additional regulatory supervisory oversight if its concentration in commercial real estate lending exceeds regulatory parameters. Pursuant to interagency\nguidance issued by the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies, supervisory criteria were put in place to define commercial real estate concentrations as:\n \u00b7 Construction, land development and other land loans that represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital; or \n \u00b7 Commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) that represent 300% or more of total risk-based capital and the real estate portfolio has increased more than 50% or more during the prior 36 months. \nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's exposure to commercial real estate lending was below the parameters discussed above.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into various types of transactions that include commitments to extend credit. We apply the same credit standards to these commitments as we apply to our other lending activities and have included these commitments in our lending risk evaluations. Our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments. See Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion on our commitments.\nCommercial Loans. Commercial loans increased $32.8 million, or 2.7%, from $1.22 billion at December 31, 2016 to $1.25 billion at December 31, 2017. Commercial lending consists of loans to small and medium-sized businesses in a wide variety of industries. We provide a broad range of commercial loans, including lines of credit for working capital purposes and term loans for the acquisition of equipment and other purposes. Commercial loans are generally collateralized by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, real estate and other commercial assets, and may be supported by other credit enhancements such as personal guarantees. However, where warranted by the overall financial condition of the borrower, loans may be unsecured and based on the cash flow of the business.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's commercial loan portfolio, segregated by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAt December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n% of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloan portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloan portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloan portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nManufacturing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n85,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n96,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n135,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFinance and insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n42,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n64,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nHealth care\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n164,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n154,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n12.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n126,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n128,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n126,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n118,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConstruction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n68,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPublic administration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n240,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n256,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n221,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAll other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n521,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n474,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n450,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,250,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,217,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,175,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReal Estate - Mortgage Loans. Real estate mortgage loans increased $78.4 million, or 6.7%, from $1.17 billion at December 31, 2016 to $1.25 billion at December 31, 2017. Real estate mortgage loans include various types of loans for which we hold real property as collateral. We generally restrict commercial real estate lending activity to owner-occupied properties or to investor properties that are owned by customers with which we have a current banking relationship. We make commercial real estate loans at both fixed-and,floating-interest rates, with maturities generally ranging from five to 20 years. The Bank's underwriting standards generally require that a commercial real estate loan not exceed 75% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. In addition, we originate SBA 504 loans on owner-occupied properties with maturities of up to 25 years in which the SBA allows for financing of up to 90% of the project cost and takes a security position that is subordinated to us, as well as U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development loans.\nThe properties securing the Company's real estate mortgage loan portfolio are located primarily in the states of Colorado and Arizona. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, 68% and 67% of the Company's outstanding real estate mortgage loans were in the Colorado market, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's real estate mortgage portfolio, segregated by property type.\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAt December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResidential & commercial owner-occupied\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n484,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n475,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n436,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nResidential & commercial investor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n764,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n61.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n695,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n59.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n579,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n57.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,249,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,171,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,016,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConstruction and land. Construction and land increased $90.0 million, or 51.6%, from $174.5 million at December 31, 2016 to $264.4 million at December 31, 2017. We have a portfolio of loans for the acquisition and development of land for residential building projects. We also finance construction projects involving one- to four-family residences. We provide financing to residential developers that we believe have demonstrated a favorable record of accurately projecting completion dates and budgeting expenses. We provide loans for the construction of both pre-sold projects and projects built prior to the location of a specific buyer (speculative loan), although speculative loans are provided on a more selective basis. Residential construction loans are due upon the sale of the completed project and are generally collateralized by first liens on the real estate and have floating interest rates. In addition, these loans generally have credit enhancements in the form of personal guarantees to provide an additional source of repayment. We typically require a permanent financing commitment or prequalification be in place before we make a residential construction loan. Moreover, we generally monitor construction draws monthly and inspect property to ensure that construction is progressing as projected. Our underwriting standards generally require that the principal amount of a speculative loan be no more than 75% of the appraised value of the completed construction project or 80% of pre-sold projects. Values are determined primarily by approved independent appraisers.\nWe also originate loans to finance the construction of multi-family, office, industrial, retail and tax credit projects. These projects are predominantly owned by the user of the property, or are sponsored by financially strong developers who maintain an ongoing banking relationship with us. Our underwriting standards generally require that the principal amount of these loans be no more than 75% of the appraised value. Values are determined primarily by approved independent appraisers.\nConstruction and land loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the construction and land portfolio are generally located in the states of Colorado and Arizona. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, 76% and 71%, respectively, of the Company's construction and land loans outstanding were generated in the Colorado market.\nConsumer Loans. Consumer loans increased $15.1 million, or 5.7%, from $267.0 million at December 31, 2016 to $282.1 million at December 31, 2017. We provide a broad range of consumer loans to customers, including personal lines of credit, home equity loans and automobile loans. In order to improve customer service, continuity and customer retention, the same loan officer often services the banking relationships of both the business and business owners or management. We offer residential mortgage loans as part of our consumer mortgage products. This residential mortgage financing program offers competitive pricing and terms for the purchase, refinance or permanent financing of mortgage loans, with an average loan size of approximately $800,000. For primary residences, the standard loan-to-value is 80% for loans up to $1.5 million. The loan-to-value decreases as the size of the loan increases, with a standard loan-to-value of 55% on loans in excess of $3.0 million. In addition, we generally only finance 5/1, and 7/1 adjustable-rate mortgage loans as well as 15-year fixed-rate loans. Residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2017 and 2016, totaled $213.8 million or 80% and $197.9 million or 74%, respectively, of the consumer loan portfolio.\nOther loans. Other loans decreased $4.8 million, or 4.7%, from $103.8 million at December 31, 2016 to $98.9 million at December 31, 2017. Other loans include lending products such as taxable and tax-exempt\nleasing, not defined as commercial real estate, acquisition and development, construction, or consumer loans.\nNonperforming Assets\nOur nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, restructured loans, loans past due 90 days or more, OREO and other repossessed assets. Nonaccrual loans are those loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued. The following table sets forth information with respect to these assets at the dates indicated.\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAt December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNonperforming loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNonaccrual loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n15,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate -

A delinquent loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes 90 days past due. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all accrued and unpaid interest on the loan is reversed and deducted from either earnings as a reduction of reported interest income for current year interest or against the allowance for interest accrued in a prior year. No additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain. When the issues relating to a nonaccrual loan are finally resolved, there may ultimately be an actual write-down or charge-off of the principal balance of the loan, which may necessitate additional charges to earnings. Restructured loans are those for which concessions, including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to the borrower, or the reduction of interest or principal, have been granted due to the borrower's weakened financial condition. Interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur. Interest income that would have been recorded had nonaccrual loans performed in accordance with their original contract terms during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was immaterial due to the low level of nonaccrual loans during those periods. OREO represents real property taken by the Company either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower. Repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers. Subsequent to acquisition at fair value, repossessed assets and OREO are carried at the lesser of cost or fair market value, less selling costs. See Note 18 - Fair Value Measurements for additional discussion on the valuation of OREO assets.\nNonperforming assets increased $4.6 million to $12.9 million at December 31, 2017, from $8.4 million at December 31, 2016.

The Company has entered into a contract to sell its largest OREO property, located in Colorado and comprising 97% of the overall OREO balance. The Company does not expect a material gain or loss on the disposition of this property. The Company has dedicated significant resources to the workout and resolution of nonaccrual loans and OREO, and continues to closely monitor the financial condition of its clients.\nIn addition to the nonperforming assets described above, the Company had 42 customer relationships considered by management to be potential problem loans with outstanding principal of approximately $27.7 million at December 31, 2017. A potential problem loan is one as to which management has concerns about the borrower's future performance under the terms of the loan contract. These loans are current as to the principal and interest and, accordingly, are not included in the nonperforming asset categories. However, further deterioration may result in the loan being classified as nonperforming. The level of potential problem loans is factored into the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses consists of three elements: (i) specific reserves determined in accordance with ASC Topic 310 - Receivables based on probable losses on specific loans; (ii) general reserves determined in accordance with guidance in ASC Topic 450 - Contingencies, based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company; and (iii) unallocated reserves, which is intended to capture potential misclassifications in the loan grading system.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's recognition of the risks of extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio. The allowance is maintained to provide for probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans and for probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is based on various factors affecting the loan portfolio, including a review of problem loans, business conditions, historical loss experience, evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral, and holding and disposal costs.

Loans charged off, net of amounts recovered from previously charged off loans, reduce the allowance for loan losses. The amount of the allowance is a function of the levels of loans outstanding, the level of nonperforming loans, historical loan loss experience, amount of loan losses charged against the reserve during a given period and current economic conditions. Federal regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, review our loans and allowance for loan and credit losses. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover anticipated loan losses. However, management may determine a need to increase the allowances for loan losses, or regulators, when reviewing the Bank's loan and commitment portfolio in the future, may request the Bank increase such allowances. Either of these events could adversely affect our earnings. Further, there can be no assurance that actual loan losses will not exceed the allowances for loan losses.\nThe methodology used in the periodic review of reserve adequacy, which is performed at least quarterly, is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in actual and expected credit losses. These changes are reflected in both the general and unallocated reserves. The historical loss ratios and estimated risk factors related to segmenting our loan portfolio, which are key considerations in this analysis, are updated quarterly. The review of reserve adequacy is performed by executive management and presented to the Audit Committee quarterly for its review and consideration. For additional information on the Company's methodology for estimating the allowance for loan and credit losses, see Note 4 - Loans.\nThe table below provides an allocation of the allowance for loan and credit losses by loan type; however, allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories:\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAt December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLoans in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLoans in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLoans in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLoans in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLoans in\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncategory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncategory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncategory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncategory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ncategory\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nas a %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nas a %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nas a %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nas a %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nas a %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nof total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ngross\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nallowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nallowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nallowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nallowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nallowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nloans\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16,837 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15,398 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24,215 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n43.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,614 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n40.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nReal estate -

The allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts, by loan classification, to be charged to the allowance. We believe that the table is a useful device for assessing the adequacy of the allowance as a whole. The allowance is utilized as a single unallocated allowance available for all loans. As part of the overall allowance, the Company maintains an unallocated portion that is intended to capture the inherent risk that certain loans may be assigned an incorrect loan grade. The Company determines the level of the unallocated allowance by reference to its migration of historical losses and the percentage of loans identified as incorrectly graded through the loan review process.\nThe Company recorded a $3.2 million provision for loan losses during 2017 compared to a $2.1 million provision for loan losses reversal during 2016. The provision for loan losses in 2017 was primarily a function of loan growth, while the negative provision in 2016 was due to improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio, loan loss recoveries and the release of a specific reserve on an impaired credit. Nonperforming assets increased $4.6 million, or 54.6% to $12.9 million at December 31, 2017 from $8.4 million a year earlier. The increase in nonperforming assets was due to nonaccrual loans, which increased but only represent 0.24% of the total loan portfolio. The Company had charge-offs of $0.9 million and $7.8 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company had recoveries of $2.3 million and $2.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Although the Company continues to record charge-offs, management believes that its credit quality outlook remains favorable and that the Company's allowance for loan and credit losses provides adequate coverage for probable loan and credit losses. The allowance for loan and credit losses to total loans was 1.21% and 1.13% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allowance for loan and credit losses to nonperforming loans was 482.4% and 1,010.4% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. It is possible management may determine a need to increase the allowance for loan and credit losses due to changes in the factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan and credit losses. Such determination could have an adverse effect in the level of future loan and credit loss provisions and the Company's earnings.\nInvestments\nThe investment portfolio is primarily composed of residential MBS explicitly (GNMA) and implicitly (FNMA and FHLMC) backed by the U.S. Government, with the majority of the portfolio either maturing or repricing within one to five years. The portfolio does not include any securities exposed to sub-prime mortgage loans. The investment portfolio also includes single-issuer TPS and corporate debt securities. The corporate debt securities portfolio primarily consists of senior and subordinated debentures issued by the financial services industry. None of the issuing institutions are in default nor have interest payments on the TPS been deferred. Our investment strategies are reviewed in meetings of the ALCO.\nCertain TPS and corporate debt securities held by the Company are subject to deduction from regulatory capital under the Corresponding Deduction Approach promulgated in Basel III. As such, the Company expects its portfolio of TPS and corporate debt securities to decrease in future periods.\nThere were no security transfers between the available for sale and held to maturity categories during 2017.\nOur goals with respect to the investment portfolio are to:\n \u00b7 Maximize safety and soundness; \n \u00b7 Provide adequate liquidity; \n \u00b7 Maximize rate of return within the constraints of applicable liquidity requirements; and \n \u00b7 Complement asset/liability management strategies. \nThe following table sets forth the book value (fair value on AFS securities and amortized cost on HTM securities) of our investment portfolio by type at the dates indicated.

Available for sale securities had a net unrealized gain of $2.7 million at December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company's available for sale securities in a temporary unrealized loss position of $0.3 million consisted primarily of TPS. The fair value of these securities is expected to recover as the securities approach their stated maturity or repricing date.\nOther investments consist primarily of FHLB stock required to support a borrowing base with the FHLB. FHLB stock holdings are largely dependent upon the Company's liquidity position. To the extent the need for wholesale funding increases or decreases, the Company may purchase additional or sell excess FHLB stock, respectively. During 2017, other investments decreased $1.2 million due to net redemptions of FHLB stock.\nThe following table sets forth the book value, maturity and approximate yield of the securities in our investment portfolio at December 31, 2017. Other investments include stock in the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank, which have no maturity date.

Intangible assets primarily represent client relationship lists. The Company recognized $0.6 million of intangible asset amortization during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Other than amortization, no other activity occurred in intangible assets during 2017 and 2016.\nBOLI. BOLI increased $1.4 million in 2017 to $55.0 million at December 31, 2017 due to growth in the cash surrender values of the underlying policies. BOLI increased $4.3 million in 2016 to $53.7 million at December 31, 2016. During 2016, the Company purchased additional policies of $3.2 million, had an increase of $1.3 million due to growth in the cash surrender values of the underlying policies and claims of $0.2 million\nDeferred Income Taxes, Net. Deferred income taxes, net decreased $6.8 million in 2017 to $13.1 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily from the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction in the federal tax rate from the TCJA. The remeasurement resulted in a $7.2 million reduction in the net deferred income tax asset. Deferred income taxes decreased $2.3 million in 2016 to $19.9 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily from the tax effect of the $7.4 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses in 2016. Deferred income taxes are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. See Note 11 - Income Taxes for additional discussion of income taxes and deferred tax items.\nOther Real Estate Owned. During 2016 and 2017, the Company had no OREO activity. At December 31, 2017, the Company held two properties, with one Colorado property comprising over 97% of the total OREO balance. The Company has entered into a contract to sell the Colorado property and does not expect a material gain or loss on the disposition.\nOther Assets. Other assets increased $0.3 million during 2017 to $20.1 million at December 31, 2017. In 2016, other assets increased $1.8 million during 2016 to $19.8 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to a receivable from the Company's landlord on reimbursement for leasehold improvements on the new executive office lease. The reimbursement has been accounted for as an incentive and is being recognized as a reduction to rent over the lease term.\nDeposits\nOur primary source of funds has historically been customer deposits. We offer a variety of accounts for depositors, which are designed to attract both short- and long-term deposits. These accounts include CDs, money market accounts, savings accounts, checking accounts, and individual retirement accounts. We believe we receive a large amount of noninterest-bearing deposits because we provide customers the option\nof paying for treasury management services in cash or by maintaining additional noninterest-bearing account balances. The Company's noninterest-bearing deposits represented 46% and 42% of total deposits at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest-bearing accounts earn interest at rates based on competitive market factors and our desire to increase or decrease certain types of maturities or deposits.\nThe Company views its reciprocal CDARS and ICS accounts as customer-related deposits. The CDARS and ICS programs are provided through a third party and are designed to provide full FDIC insurance on deposit amounts by exchanging or reciprocating larger depository relationships with other member banks. Depositor funds are broken into smaller amounts and placed with other banks that are members of the network. Each member bank issues deposit amounts at a level that the entire deposit is eligible for FDIC insurance. CDARS and ICS are technically brokered deposits; however, the Company considers the reciprocal deposits placed through these programs as core funding due to the customer relationship that generated the transaction and does not report the balances as brokered sources in its internal or external financial reports. The Company had balances of $344.9 million and $327.8 million in CDARS and ICS accounts at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe following tables present the average balances for each major category of deposits and the weighted average interest rates paid for interest-bearing deposits for the periods indicated.\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $32.9 million, a 5.7% decrease from $34.9 million in 2016. The decrease in net income was due to a $7.2 million increase in tax expense as a result of the TCJA. The increase to tax expense also reduced the return on average assets and equity. Return on average assets decreased to 0.87% for 2017 compared to 1.02% in 2016. Return on average shareholders' equity decreased to 10.27% from 12.15% in 2016.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $34.9 million, a 33.9% increase from $26.1 million in 2015. Return on average assets increased to 1.02% in 2016 compared to 0.83% a year earlier. Return on\naverage shareholders' equity also increased in 2016 to 12.15% from 8.77% in 2015. The financial improvement in 2016 was due to an increase in net interest income of $4.4 million and a decrease of $8.5 million in the provision for loan losses in 2016 over 2015.\nEarnings per common share on a diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, was $0.78, $0.84 and $0.62, respectively.\nNet Interest Income. The largest component of our net income is our net interest income. NII is the difference between interest income, principally from loans and investment securities, and interest expense, principally on customer deposits and borrowings. Changes in NII result from changes in volume, net interest spread and net interest margin. Volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin refers to NII divided by average interest-earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe majority of our assets are interest-earning and our liabilities are interest-bearing. Accordingly, changes in interest rates may impact our net interest margin. The FOMC uses the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate used by banks to lend to each other, to influence interest rates and the national economy. Changes in the federal funds rate have a direct correlation to changes in one month Libor and the the prime rate, the underlying indeces for most of the floating-rate loans issued by the Company. The target federal funds rate was held at a range of 0-25 basis points between December 2008 and December 2015. On December 17, 2015, the FOMC increased the target rate to 25-50 basis points, the first increase since June 2006. The target rate was increased another 100 basis points between 2016-2017 and is at a range of 125-150 basis at December 31, 2017. As the Company is asset sensitive, low rates negatively impact the Company's earnings and NIM and the Company benefits as the target rate increases.\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, certain information related to our average asset and liability structure and our average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities. Such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. NII and NIM are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis to recognize the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. The taxable-equivalent NII and NIM in the following table were computed using the applicable state tax rate and a 35.0% federal tax rate. Beginning in 2018, the taxable-equivalent NII and NIM\nwill be calculated using a 21.0% federal tax rate due to the enactment of the TCJA. Assuming no other changes, NII and NIM will be reduced in future periods due to the decrease in the federal income tax rate.\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

interest-earning assets increased $316.4 million to $3.63 billion at December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase of $252.6 million in the loan portfolio and $74.2 million in the investment portfolio. Taxable-equivalent net interest income grew $16.0 million due to the growth in the loan portfolio. The yield on earning assets increased 11 basis points, from 4.09% to 4.20% in 2017, primarily due to a 12 basis point increase in the yield on the loan portfolio.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $143.7 million during 2017 to $2.03 billion. The increase was due to a $106.1 million increase in interest-bearing deposits and a $37.6 million increase in Customer Repurchases and short-term borrowings. The average cost of liabilities was 0.62% in both 2017 and 2016. Although the cost of short-term borrowings increased 53 basis points in 2017 due to the increase in the target federal funds rate, the overall cost of deposits remained stable at 13 basis points in both 2017 and 2016.\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $268.2 million to $3.31 billion at December 31, 2016. The loan portfolio increased $275.8 million in 2016, while the investment portfolio declined $15.9 million, the sixth consecutive year the investment portfolio has declined. Taxable-equivalent net interest income grew $6.2 million due to the growth in interest-earning assets, primarily in the loan portfolio. In addition, net interest income included 366 days in 2016 due to the leap year, compared to 365 days in 2015. The yield on earning assets declined nine basis points, from 4.18% to 4.09% in 2016, primarily due to a lower yield on the loan portfolio. In October 2016, the Company entered into two interest-rate swaps to hedge the cash flows on a portion of its LIBOR-based loan portfolio. The swaps have a weighted average term of six years and a combined notional value of $100.0 million. The Company pays a variable rate based on 1-month LIBOR and receives a weighted average fixed-rate of 1.20%.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $123.4 million during 2016 to $1.88 billion. The increase was due to an $83.8 million increase in interest-bearing deposits and a $39.6 million net increase in Customer Repurchases and short/long-term borrowings. The average cost of liabilities increased in 2016, to 0.62%, from 0.55% in 2015. The increase in the yield on interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the increase in the target federal funds rate in December 2015, which increased short-term borrowing costs in 2016.\nThe Company has executed a series of interest-rate swap transactions designated as cash flow hedges. The swaps fix the effective interest rate for payments due on the junior subordinated debentures with the objective of reducing the Company's exposure to adverse changes in cash flows relating to payments on its LIBOR-\nbased floating rate debt. The weighted average interest rate paid (fixed-rate) was 5.44%, 5.44% and 5.48% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decline in the rate during 2016 was due to the maturity of a swap in early 2015 with a fixed-rate of 6.04% that was replaced with a new swap with a fixed-rate of 4.99%. The remaining contractual maturities of the swaps vary between 2 and 6 years.

The increase in the provision for loan losses in 2017 was primarily due to loan growth, an additional allowance segmentation on a pool of investor office loans within the Denver market and an increase in classified loans. Partially offsetting these items were net recoveries of $1.36 million.\nThe decrease in the provision for loan losses in 2016 was primarily due to the reversal of a $2.3 million specific reserve on an impaired credit, recoveries of $2.5 million and a decrease in multi-family lending, a category with a higher reserve allocation. Partially offsetting these items were loan growth and a $6.8 million increase in classified loans in 2016.\nNonperforming loans to total loans were 0.25%, 0.11%, and 0.60% at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Deposit service charges primarily consist of fees earned from our treasury management services. Customers are given the option to pay for these services in cash or by offsetting the fees for these services against an earnings credit that is given for maintaining noninterest-bearing deposits. Fees earned from treasury management services will fluctuate based on the number of customers using the services and from changes in U.S. Treasury rates which are used as a benchmark for the earnings credit rate. Other miscellaneous deposit charges are transactional by nature and may not be consistent period over period. As the earnings credit rate increases, the amount of cash fees paid for service charges decreases. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company evaluated and increased the rates assessed for treasury management services which increased 2017 income.\nInvestment Advisory Income. Investment advisory income increased $0.5 million or 8.9% to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, advisory income decreased $0.1 million or 2.0% to $5.7 million compared to 2015. Revenue from this source is generally a function of the value of Assets Under Management (AUM) on the last day of each quarter. Discretionary AUM at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $974.3 million and $844.5 million, respectively. Average AUM was $908.7 million, $831.8 million and $876.0, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenue from investment advisory income benefits from market appreciation and is negatively impacted from market depreciation.\nInsurance Income. Insurance income is derived from two main areas: benefits consulting and P&C. Revenue from benefits consulting and P&C are recurring revenue sources as policies and contracts generally renew or rewrite on an annual or more frequent basis. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, insurance revenue was composed of the following:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBenefits consulting\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n62.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n58.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n54.6\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProperty and casualty\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n37.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n41.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGrowth in benefits consulting was the primary cause of the $0.6 million increase in insurance income in 2017. In 2015 and 2016, the average P&C rate for the industry declined. As our revenue is typically derived as percentage of the premium, this negatively impacted revenue. At the same time, the Company's benefits consulting division has continued to grow. The combination of these two factors has caused the shift in the percentage of revenue in the table above.\nOther Income. Other income is composed of changes in the cash surrender value of BOLI, earnings on other investments, loan and commitment fees, merchant and bankcard fees, customer swap fees, wire transfer fees, foreign exchange fees and safe deposit income.\nOther income decreased $1.8 million to $8.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a $2.9 million increase to $9.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in 2017 is due to a $1.2 million decrease in income from other investments and a $0.5 million decrease in customer swap fees. Other investments consist primarily of funds licensed as Small Business Investment Companies. The Company's income from these funds will vary based on transactions occurring within the funds.\nOther income increased $2.9 million to $9.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a $1.5 million increase to $6.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in 2016 is due to a $1.2 million increase in income from other investments and a $1.0 million increase in customer swap fees.\nNoninterest Expense.

Selected Financial Data). The efficiency ratio is a measure of the Company's overhead, measuring the percentage of each dollar of income that is paid in operating expenses. In 2017 the Company was successful in improving its operating leverage by growing net interest income while limiting the growth in expenses. The Company maintains its goal of reducing the efficiency ratio over the next few years and is committed to exploring cost-reduction strategies. However, assuming no other changes, the TCJA will cause the efficiency ratio to increase in 2018 due to the reduction in taxable-equivalent net interest income discussed above. Further increases in the federal funds target rate by the FOMC would benefit the Company's net interest income and efficiency ratio.\nSalaries and Employee Benefits. The Company's full-time equivalent employee base at the end of 2017 was 538 compared to 533 in 2016.\nSalaries and employee benefits increased $3.6 million or 5.1% during the year ended December 31, 2017. Contributing to the increase in 2017 was a $2.1 million increase in salaries and a $1.4 million increase in bonus expense. Salaries increased due to the annual cost of living and merit increases effective in the second quarter of 2017 and the increase in full-time equivalent employees.\nSalaries and employee benefits increased $1.9 million or 2.8% during the year ended December 31, 2016. Contributing to the increase in 2016 was a $0.9 million increase in salaries and commission expense, $0.6 million increase in 401(k) matching expense and a $0.5 million increase in insurance benefits. Salaries were also impacted by the annual cost of living and merit increases effective in the second quarter of 2016, offset by a decrease in severance expense in 2016. The Company has a 401(k) matching program that is based on the overall profitability of the Company. Based on the Company's financial performance in 2016, an additional match of $0.5 million was made in 2016 that was not made in 2015. The Company is partially self-insured on its medical and dental programs. Insurance benefits will vary based on participant claims. In 2016, the Company's participants experienced several large claims that increased our insurance expense.\nIncluded in salaries and employee benefits is expense related to share-based compensation used to retain existing employees and to recruit new employees. The Company expects to continue using share-based compensation in the future as it is considered an important part of overall compensation. Costs associated with the plan are influenced by the number of participants in the Company's stock bonus pool and the proportion of incentive compensation paid in cash versus stock.\nOccupancy Expenses, Premises and Equipment. Occupancy expenses consist primarily of rent, utilities, property taxes, insurance, depreciation and information systems maintenance. Occupancy costs decreased $0.3 million or 2.0% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. In January 2016, the Company signed a new lease agreement for its principal executive offices and recognized seven months of expense related to the lease in 2016, in addition to a full year of expense on the former principal executive office lease that terminated on December 31, 2016. The transition cost of maintaining leases on two locations did not reocurr in 2017. Occupancy costs increased $1.9 million or 14.4% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2016 was due to the cost of maintaining leases on two locations for part of 2016.\nFDIC and Other Assessments. FDIC and other assessments consist of premiums paid by the FDIC-insured institutions and by Colorado chartered banks. The assessments by the FDIC and the Colorado Division of Banking are based on statutory and risk classification factors. The decrease in 2017 and 2016 was due to a statutory reduction in assessment rates in the second half of 2016.\nNet Gain on Securities, Other Assets and Other Real Estate Owned. The Company recognized gains on securities, other assets and OREO of $0.5 million, $0.1 million and $0.4 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net gains on securities for the years presented were primarily from securities called/redeemed.\nOther Expense. Other operating expenses increased $0.1 million and $1.1 million, in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2016 was partially due to an increase in professional service costs related to\nthe Company's process and efficiency evaluations conducted in 2016. The Company has continued to see an increase in expenses in this area due to ongoing regulatory compliance and information technology projects.\nFederal Income Taxes. The effective tax rate was 38.4%, 25.9%, and 26.9% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 was due to a $7.2 million increase to tax expense from the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the TCJA. The decrease in the corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% is expected to reduce the Company's effective tax rate in 2018.\nPermanent differences, primarily arising from changes in the cash surrender value of BOLI and tax-exempt income are the primary activities impacting the effective tax rate in each year.\nSegment Results\nThe Company has three segments: Commercial Banking, Fee-Based Lines, and Corporate Support and Other.

Volume increases in our interest earning assets and an increase in yield were the primary reasons for the increase in net interest income. Average loans increased $252.6 million and the yield on interest-earning assets increased 11 basis points in 2017. The growth in the loan portfolio also resulted in an increase to our provision for loan losses, which increased $5.2 million in 2017 over 2016. Noninterest expense decreased $4.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016, partially due to a decline in occupancy costs associated with the Company's move to a new headquarters location in 2016. In addition, certain centralized expenses included in the Commercial Banking segment in 2016 were moved to the Corporate Support segment in 2017. The provision for income taxes increased $9.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher pre-tax income and the impact of the TCJA.\nThe Commercial Banking segment reported net income of $40.2 million and $29.8 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. Volume increases in our interest earning assets was the primary reason for the increase in net interest income. Average loans were $275.8 million higher in 2016 than in 2015, which muted the effect of lower yields on interest-earning assets. Asset quality improvements and recoveries on charged-off loans resulted in a loan loss provision reversal of $1.8 million. Noninterest income grew in 2016, primarily due to $1.2 million in fees generated from the sale of interest rate swaps.\nFee-Based Lines.\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFee-Based Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome Statement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(12)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(23)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(42)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n47.8\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45.2\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNoninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n19,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n18,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNoninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n17,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n16,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(174)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.0)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n241.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(271)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(42.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income before management fees and overhead allocations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n87.5\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(398)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(46.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome from discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(71)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n100.0\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nManagement fees and overhead allocations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(404)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(24.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25.4\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(397)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,208)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(542)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n67.1\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(666)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(122.9)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, the Company ceased operations of GMB, a provider of investment banking services that was a component of the Fee-Based Lines segment. The decision was based in part by increasing regulatory compliance costs related to maintaining GMB's broker-dealer license and earnings volatility which was highly dependent on deal volume. Results for GMB for 2015 have been reclassified as discontinued operations. See Note 2 - Discontinued Operations for additional discussion.\nNet loss in the Fee-Based Lines segment decreased $0.8 million in 2017 compared to 2016. An increase in noninterest income of $1.1 million, while noninterest expense remained relatively flat, was the primary reason for the improvement. The increase in tax expense from the TCJA also impacted the Fee-Based Lines, increasing tax expense by $0.5 million. Absent the increase in tax expense from the TCJA, the segment would have reported a positive net income.\nNet loss in the Fee-Based Lines segment increased $0.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Lower investment advisory and insurance revenue coupled with higher salary and benefit costs contributed to the net loss in 2016. At December 31, 2016, AUM decreased $14.7 million during 2016 to $844.5 million from $859.2 million at the end of 2015. Average AUM in 2016 was $831.8 million compared to $876.0 million in 2015. Noninterest expense in the segment is predominately compensation-related, which is primarily variable and directly related to revenue. However, as the Company invests in new production staff, compensation as a percentage of revenue for those employees is higher in the earlier years until those new producers build a revenue base.\nCorporate Support and Other.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCorporate Support and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncrease (decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome Statement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6,994)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6,902)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4,231)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(92)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1.3)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,671)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(63.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProvision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(140)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(285)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(417)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n50.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n31.7\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNoninterest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,039)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(56.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34.3\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNoninterest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n56,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n49,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n45,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7.9\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBenefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(22,657)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(20,796)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(18,716)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,861)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8.9)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,080)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet loss before management fees and overhead allocations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(39,938)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(33,643)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(29,734)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(6,295)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(18.7)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,909)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(13.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nManagement fees and overhead allocations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(34,251)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(29,585)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(26,559)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,666)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(15.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,026)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11.4)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(5,687)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4,058)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(3,175)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,629)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(40.1)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(883)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(27.8)\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Corporate Support and Other segment consists of activities of the Parent; non-production, back-office support operations; and eliminating transactions in consolidation. Non-production, back-office operations include human resources, accounting and finance, audit and compliance, information technology, Special Assets Group, and loan and deposit operations. The Company has a process for allocating these support\noperations back to the production lines based on an internal allocation methodology that is updated annually. Noninterest expense includes salaries and benefits of employees of the Parent and support functions as well as the nonemployee overhead operating costs not directly associated with another segment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the segment reported a net loss of $5.7 million, an increase of $1.6 million from 2016. Lower noninterest income was due to the earnings on the Company's investments in mezzanine funds, which decreased in 2017 compared to 2016. Continued investment in the operational redesign of the Company's credit process, business intelligence and other consulting services resulted in an increase in noninterest expense during 2017.\nThe segment reported a net loss of $4.1 million in 2016 compared to a net loss of $3.2 million in the prior year. Lower net interest income was the result of additional interest expense of $1.7 million in 2016 relating to the Notes and lower interest income due to a prior-year recapture of $1.0 million of interest income on problem loan resolutions. Higher salary, health insurance, facility rents and service contract costs resulted in an increase in noninterest expense during 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses relates to a portfolio of loans purchased by the Parent from the Bank. This portfolio has steadily decreased since the 2009 purchase due to loan repayments and collateral sales. The declining balance of the portfolio and the overall asset quality improvement has contributed to the trend of declining provision for loan losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity refers to the Company's ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet financial obligations to its customers and shareholders in order to fund loans, to respond to deposit outflows and to cover operating expenses. Maintaining a level of liquid funds through asset/liability management seeks to ensure that these needs are met at a reasonable cost. Liquidity is essential to compensate for fluctuations in the balance sheet and provide funds for growth and normal operating expenditures. Sources of funds include customer deposits, scheduled amortization of loans, loan prepayments, scheduled maturities and calls of investments and prepayments from mortgage-backed securities. Liquidity needs may also be met by deposit growth, converting assets into cash, raising funds in the brokered CD market or borrowing using lines of credit with correspondent banks, the FHLB or the FRB. Longer-term liquidity needs may be met by selling securities available for sale or raising additional capital.\nLiquidity management is the process by which the Company manages the continuing flow of funds necessary to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. The objective of liquidity management is to ensure the Company has the ability to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to allow us to sustain our operations. These funding commitments include withdrawals by depositors, credit commitments to borrowers, shareholder dividends, debt payments, expenses of our operations and capital expenditures. Liquidity is monitored and closely managed by ALCO, a group of senior officers from the lending, deposit gathering, finance and treasury areas. ALCO's primary responsibilities are to ensure the necessary level of funds are available for normal operations as well as maintain a contingency funding policy to ensure that liquidity stress events are quickly identified and management plans are in place to respond. This is accomplished through the use of policies which establish limits and require measurements to monitor liquidity trends, including management reporting that identifies the amounts and costs of all available funding sources.\nThe Company's current liquidity position is expected to be more than adequate to fund expected asset growth. Historically, our primary source of funds has been customer deposits. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments - which are influenced by fluctuations in the general level of interest rates, returns available on other investments, competition, economic conditions, and other factors - are less predictable.\nLiquidity from asset categories is provided through cash and interest-bearing deposits with other banks, which totaled $80.2 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $96.1 million at December 31, 2016. Additional asset liquidity sources include principal and interest payments from securities in the Company's investment portfolio and loan portfolio. Liability liquidity sources include attracting deposits at competitive rates and maintaining wholesale borrowing (short-term borrowings and brokered CDs) credit relationships.\nThe Company's loan to core deposit ratio increased to 97.5% at December 31, 2017, from 96.8% at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $77.6 million and $106.2 million in outstanding wholesale borrowings, respectively. Average wholesale borrowings were $108.7 million and $84.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company uses various forms of short-term borrowings for cash management and liquidity purposes, regularly accessing its federal funds and FHLB lines to manage its daily cash position. At December 31, 2017, the Bank has approved federal funds purchase lines with eight correspondent banks with an aggregate credit line of $180.0 million. The Bank also has a line of credit from the FHLB that is limited by the amount of eligible collateral available to secure it and the Company's investment in FHLB stock. Borrowings under the FHLB line are required to be secured by unpledged securities and qualifying loans. Borrowings may also be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity or repricing intervals of assets.\nAvailable funding through correspondent lines and the FHLB at December 31, 2017, totaled $709.2 million or 19.2% of the Company's earning assets. Available funding consisted of $180.0 million of federal fund lines and $529.2 million in secured FHLB borrowing capacity. Access to funding through correspondent lines is dependent upon the cash position of the correspondent banks and there may be times when certain lines are not available. In addition, certain lines require a one day rest period after a specified number of consecutive days of accessing the lines. The Company believes it has sufficient borrowing capacity and diversity in correspondent banks to meet its needs.\nAt the holding company level, our primary sources of funds are dividends paid from the Bank and fee-based subsidiaries, management fees assessed to the Bank and the Fee-Based Lines, proceeds from the issuance of common stock, and other capital markets activity. The main use of this liquidity is the quarterly payment of dividends on our common stock, quarterly interest payments on the subordinated debentures and notes payable, payments for mergers and acquisitions activity, and payments for the salaries and benefits for the employees of the holding company.\nThe Company also maintains a revolving line of credit for an aggregate amount of up to $20.0 million, all of which was available at December 31, 2017. The line of credit has a one year term and matures in May 2018. Funds drawn will be used for general corporate purposes and backup liquidity.\nThe approval of the Colorado State Banking Board is required prior to the declaration of any dividend by the Bank if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits for the preceding two years. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 provides that the Bank cannot pay a dividend if it will cause the Bank to be undercapitalized.\u201d At December 31, 2017, the Bank was not otherwise restricted in its ability to pay dividends to the holding company. The Company's ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends upon the availability of dividends from the Bank, earnings from its Fee-Based Lines, and upon the Company's compliance with the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (see Note 17 - Regulatory Matters). The holding company has a liquidity policy that requires the maintenance of at least 18 months of liquidity on the balance sheet based on projected cash usages, exclusive of dividends from the Bank. At December 31, 2017, the Company had a liquidity position that exceeds the policy limit, and we believe the Company has the ability to continue paying dividends.\nNet loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.1 million, which reasonably approximated the cash flows of those operations not separately stated in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows.\nShareholders' equity was $329.3 million and $302.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Changes in shareholders' equity are due to the following:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBeginning balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n302,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n273,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOptions and restricted stock, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDividends paid-common\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8,785)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7,858)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther comprehensive loss, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(707)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,717)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n32,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n34,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEnding balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n329,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n302,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents, expected cash flows from continuing operations together with alternative sources of funding are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital, loan originations, capital expenditures and other obligations for at least the next 12 months. We continually monitor existing and alternative financing sources to support our capital and liquidity needs, including but not limited to, debt issuance, common stock issuance and deposit funding sources. Based on our current financial condition and our results of operations, we believe the Company will be able to sustain its ability to raise adequate capital through one or more of these financing sources.\nWe are subject to minimum risk-based capital limitations as set forth by federal banking regulations at both the consolidated Company level and the Bank level. Under the risk-based capital guidelines, different categories of assets, including certain off-balance sheet items, such as loan commitments in excess of one year and letters of credit, are assigned different risk weights, based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset. These risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk-weighted\u201d asset base. For purposes of the risk-based capital guidelines, total capital is defined as the sum of Common Equity Tier 1,\u201d Additional Tier 1\u201d and Tier 2\u201d capital elements. Common Equity Tier 1 consists of common stock, related surplus and retained earnings. Additional Tier 1 capital includes, with certain restrictions, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, certain grandfathered regulatory capital instruments and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries. Tier 2 capital includes, with certain limitations, perpetual preferred stock not included in Tier 1 capital, subordinated debt, certain maturing capital instruments, and the allowance for loan and credit losses.\nBeginning in 2016, the CCB requirement became effective for banking organizations. The CCB is designed to establish a capital range above minimum requirements to insulate banks from periods of stress and discourage unacceptable practices that may shift certain risks from an organization's shareholders to its depositors. When the capital buffer is breached, an organization's ability to pay dividends, execute share repurchases and make discretionary bonus payments may be limited to varying degrees depending on the severity of the breach. When fully phased-in in 2019, the CCB adds a 2.5% capital requirement above existing regulatory minimum ratios. At December 31, 2017, the Bank and Holding Company maintained capital buffers in excess of the fully phased-in requirements and were not subject to additional constraints on distributions, share repurchases or discretionary bonus payments beyond existing limits. At December 31, 2017, the Bank was well-capitalized with all capital ratios exceeding the well-capitalized requirement.\nSee Note 17 - Regulatory Matters for additional capital ratio disclosure. In order to comply with the regulatory capital constraints, the Company and its Board of Directors constantly monitor the capital level and its anticipated needs based on the Company's growth. The Company has identified sources of additional capital that could be used if needed, and monitors the costs and benefits of these sources, which include both the public and private markets.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements do not reflect various off-balance sheet commitments that are made in the normal course of business, which may involve some liquidity risk. Off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in the following Contractual Obligations and Commitments section. The Company has commitments to extend credit under lines of credit and stand-by letters of credit. The Company has also committed to investing in certain partnerships. See the following section of this report and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on these commitments.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nSummarized below are the Company's contractual obligations (excluding deposit liabilities) to make future payments at December 31, 2017:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter one but\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter three\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWithin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nwithin three\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nbut within\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\none year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfive years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfive years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFederal funds purchased (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n4,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFHLB overnight funds purchased (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n73,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n73,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRepurchase agreements (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n52,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n52,959\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n30,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt obligations (2)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n7,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n10,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n141,939 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n172,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n143,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n153,937 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n333,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Interest on these obligations has been excluded due to the short-term nature of the instruments. \n (2) Principal repayment of the $72.2 million in junior subordinated debentures is assumed to be at the contractual maturity, currently beyond five years. Interest of $14.8 million on the junior subordinated debentures is calculated at the fixed-rate associated with the applicable hedging instrument through the instrument maturity date (see Note 10 - Derivatives) and is reported in the due within\u201d categories during which the interest expense is expected to be incurred. Interest payments on junior subordinated debentures after maturity of the related fixed interest rate swap hedges are variable and no estimate of those payments has been included in the preceding table. The weighted average variable-rate applicable to the junior subordinated debentures as of the date of this report is 3.90% and ranges from 3.14% to 4.55%. \n (3) Principal repayment of the $60.0 million in Notes issued in June 2015 is assumed to be at the contractual maturity, currently beyond five years. Interest of $25.6 million on the Notes is calculated at an annual fixed-rate of 5.625% through June 2025 and is reported in the due within\u201d categories during which the interest expense is expected to be incurred. From June 25, 2025 to maturity on June 25, 2030, the Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 317 basis points. No estimate of interest payments during the floating rate period is included in the preceding table. \nThe contractual amount of the Company's financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, expiring by period at December 31, 2017, is presented below:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter one but\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter three\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWithin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nwithin three\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nbut within\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAfter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\none year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfive years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nfive years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnfunded loan commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n625,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n306,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n57,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n47,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,037,773 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStandby letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n29,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nUnfunded commitments for unconsolidated investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCompany guarantees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n663,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n308,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n57,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n49,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,077,970 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the liquidity, credit enhancement and financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet. Credit risk is the principal risk associated with these instruments. The contractual amounts of these instruments represent the amount of credit risk should the instruments be fully drawn upon and the customer defaults.\nTo control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit, the Company uses the same credit quality, collateral policies and monitoring controls in making commitments and letters of credit as it does with its lending activities. The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation.\nLegally binding commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Standby letters of credit obligate the Company to meet certain financial obligations of its customers if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the customers are unable to do so. The financial standby letters of credit issued by the Company are irrevocable. Payment is only guaranteed under these letters of credit upon the borrower's failure to perform its obligations to the beneficiary.\nApproximately $52.8 million of total commitments at December 31, 2017 represent commitments to extend credit at fixed-rates of interest, which exposes the Company to some degree of interest rate risk.\nThe Company has also entered into interest-rate swap agreements under which it is required to either receive or pay cash to a counterparty depending on changes in interest rates. The interest-rate swaps are carried at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates at the balance sheet date. Interest-rate swaps recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017, do not represent amounts that will ultimately be received or paid under the contract and are therefore excluded from the table above.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs. Unlike most retail or manufacturing companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution such as the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, the impact of interest rates on a financial institution's performance is generally greater than the impact of inflation. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or to the same extent, as the prices of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates. Over short periods of time, interest rates may not move in the same direction, or at the same magnitude, as inflation.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCompany Overview. The Company is a financial holding company that offers a broad array of financial service products to its target market of professionals, small and medium-sized businesses, and high-net-worth individuals. Our principal operating segments are Commercial Banking and Fee-Based Lines.\nFrom December 31, 1995, the first complete fiscal year under the current management team, to December 31, 2017, our organization has grown from a bank holding company with two bank locations and total assets of $160.4 million to a diversified financial services holding company with 15 bank locations and total assets of $3.8 billion. We have also expanded into wealth and insurance services. The Company has a well-capitalized balance sheet that includes common equity, subordinated notes payable and subordinated debentures.\nEarnings are derived primarily from our net interest income, which is interest income less interest expense, and our noninterest income earned from Fee-Based Lines and banking service fees, offset by noninterest expense. As the majority of our assets are interest-earning and our liabilities are interest-bearing, changes in\ninterest rates impact our net interest margin, the largest component of our operating revenue (which is defined as net interest income plus noninterest income). We manage our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our operating results. We also have focused on reducing our dependency on our net interest margin by increasing our noninterest income.\nWe concentrate on developing an organization with personnel, management systems and products and services that will allow us to compete effectively and position us for growth. Although we strive to minimize costs that do not impact customer service, we continue to invest in systems and business production personnel to strengthen our future growth prospects.\nThe Company is focused on achieving financial objectives as part of its one to three year plan that are intended to enable the Company to achieve double-digit growth in earnings per share. We anticipate that achieving these objectives, coupled with maintaining our asset quality, will enable us to enhance shareholder return.\nSteps taken to realize progress on our financial objectives include: aligning production employee variable compensation with these objectives; strengthening internal networking to enhance synergies between product lines within the Company; formalizing a leadership development program; structuring management roles to provide more accountability; setting clear expectations for all producers and continuing to work with producers who are not meeting their goals; and building customer relationships.\nTo further our goal of limiting growth in noninterest expense, the Company conducted a comprehensive review of its staffing levels and expenditures in each functional area to identify areas for improvement. The Company intends to continually monitor incremental improvement and new areas for emphasis. The Company also completed a thorough analysis of its loan origination and credit underwriting process. Based on this review, the Company implemented procedural changes and clarified employee responsibilities in 2017, which we believe will improve operational efficiencies and improve customer satisfaction and employee morale. Finally, the Company has initiated an ongoing review of its facility strategy with a goal of servicing its customer base in a cost-effective manner. This has resulted in the closure of three bank locations, the combination of two bank locations in downtown Denver into one location, and the relocation of the Company's principal executive offices. As a result of the relocation of our principal executive offices, all of our client-facing employees in the downtown Denver area are in one location for the first time. The Company believes this will further strengthen internal synergies and will provide a broader platform to service the financial needs of its customers.\nAs discussed in Item 1. Business\u201d and Note 2 - Discontinued Operations, the Company ceased the operations of its investment banking division in the first quarter of 2015. The results of operations related to the investment banking division in 2015 have been reported as discontinued operations. The prior period disclosures in the following table have been adjusted to conform to the new presentation.\nInternally, management measures the contribution of the Fee-Based Lines before parent company management fees and overhead allocations. The Company believes this to be a more useful measurement as centralized administration expenses and overhead are generally not impacted by the Fee-Based Lines, but are most affected by the operations of the Bank. While the Company allocates a portion of the costs related to shared resources to the Fee-Based Lines, we measure their profitability based on a pre-allocation basis as it approximates the operating cash flow generated by the segment. A description of each segment is provided in Note 19 - Segments.\nCertain key metrics of our segments at or for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:\n\n (1) Net interest income plus noninterest income. \nNoted below are some of the significant financial performance measures and operational results for 2017 and 2016:\n\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Form 10-K beginning on page. For a discussion of the segments included in our principal activities and for certain financial information for each segment, see Segments\u201d discussed below and Note 19 - Segments.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. In making those critical accounting estimates, we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate. Different estimates we could reasonably have used, or changes in the assumptions that could occur, could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management's periodic review of the collectability of loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.\nIn determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, we analyze the various components of the loan portfolio, including impaired loans, on an individual basis. When analyzing the adequacy, we segment the loan portfolio into components with similar characteristics, such as risk classification, past due status, type of loan, industry or collateral. We have a systematic process to evaluate individual loans and pools of loans within our loan portfolio. We maintain a loan grading system whereby each loan is assigned a grade between 1 and 8, with 1 representing the highest quality credit, 7 representing a loan where collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable, and 8 representing a loss that has been or will be charged-off. Loans that are graded 5 or lower are categorized as non-classified credits, while loans graded 6 and higher are categorized as classified credits that have a higher risk of loss. Grades are assigned based upon the degree of risk associated with repayment of a loan in the normal course of business pursuant to the original terms.\nDifferences between the actual credit outcome of a loan and the risk assessment made by the Company could negatively impact the Company's earnings by requiring additional provision for loan losses. As a hypothetical example, if $25.0 million of grade 3, non-classified loans were downgraded as classified at the same historical loss factor of existing classified loans, an additional $1.5 million of provision for loan losses would be required. Conversely, a $25.0 million decrease in classified loans would result in a $1.5 million reversal of provision for loan losses.\nSee Note 4 - Loans for further discussion on management's methodology.\nFair Value\nThe Company has adopted ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), as it applies to financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined under ASC 820 as the exchange price that would be received for an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nAs a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). Fair value may be used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities such as available for sale securities and derivatives in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting. Similarly, fair value may be used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets or liabilities, such as impaired loans. Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, the Company uses various valuation techniques and assumptions in accordance with ASC 820 to determine the instrument's fair value. At December 31, 2017, $169.6 million of total assets, consisting of $166.8 million in available for sale securities and $2.8 million in derivative instruments, represented assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2016, $136.3 million of total assets, consisting of $133.0 million in available for sale securities and $3.3 million in derivative instruments, represented assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $9.1 million of single-issuer trust preferred securities (TPS) classified as Level 3. The fair value of these TPS is determined using broker-dealer quotes and trade data that may not be current. These TPS are classified as Level 3 due to lack of current market data and their illiquid nature. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, $9.6 million and $11.2 million, respectively, of total liabilities represented derivative instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis consisted of impaired loans and OREO totaling $3.8 million and $5.4 million, at December 31, 2017. Impaired loans and OREO were $1.4 million and $5.4 million at December 31, 2016. For additional information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities see Note 18 - Fair Value Measurements.\nDeferred Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance may be established. We consider the determination of this valuation allowance to be a critical accounting policy because of the need to exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets, including projections of future taxable income. These judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. See Note 11 - Income Taxes for additional information. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required in the future if the amounts of taxes recoverable through loss carry backs decline, if we project lower levels of future taxable income, or we project lower levels of tax planning strategies. Such valuation allowance would be established through a charge to income tax expense that would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe also have other policies that we consider to be significant accounting policies; however, these policies, which are disclosed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.\nFinancial Condition\nThe Company had total assets of $3.8 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to total assets of $3.6 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion at December 31, 2016. The following\nsections address the specific components of the balance sheets and significant matters relating to those components at and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nLending Activities\nGeneral. We provide a broad range of lending services, including commercial loans, commercial and residential real estate construction loans, commercial and residential real estate-mortgage loans, consumer loans, revolving lines of credit, and tax-exempt financing. Our primary lending focus is commercial and real estate lending to small and medium-sized businesses with annual sales of $5.0 million to $75.0 million, and businesses and individuals with borrowing requirements of $250,000 to $15.0 million. At December 31, 2017, substantially all of our outstanding loans were to customers within Colorado and Arizona. Interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk, maturity, underwriting and servicing costs, principal amount, and extent of other banking relationships with the customer. Interest rates are further subject to competitive pressures, money market rates, availability of funds, and government regulations. See Net Interest Income\u201d for an analysis of the interest rates on our loans.\nCredit Procedures and Review. We address credit risk through internal credit policies and procedures, including underwriting criteria, officer and customer lending limits, a multi-layered loan approval process for larger loans, periodic document examination, justification for any exceptions to credit policies, loan review and concentration monitoring. In response to the last economic downturn, the Company expanded the resources of the credit and loan review departments to provide for a more proactive identification and management of problem credits. In addition, we provide ongoing loan officer training and review. We have a continuous loan review process designed to promote early identification of credit quality problems, assisted by dedicated Senior Credit Officers that support each geographic market and major loan class. All loan officers are charged with the responsibility of reviewing, at least on a monthly basis, all past due loans in their respective portfolios. In addition, the credit administration department establishes a watch list of loans to be reviewed by the Board of Directors of the Bank. The loan portfolio is also monitored regularly by a loan review department that reports to an executive vice president of the Company and submits reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the credit administration department.\nThe Company's credit approval process is as follows:\n \u00b7 Internal lending limits for loans extended to a single borrower are established by the Board of Directors of the Bank. \n \u00b7 Credits equal to the Bank's internal lending limit require two signatures from either the Vice-Chairman of the Bank, Chief Credit Officer or a Bank President/Senior Credit Officer. \n \u00b7 Loan authority of officers is approved by the Bank's Board of Directors, reviewed annually and updated according to the growth of the Bank. The Board of Directors may designate different approval authorities depending on loan grade, loan type, and whether the loan is a new credit or renewal of credit. \n \u00b7 The Board of Directors of the Bank designates the approval authority of the loan committee. The presence of two of the following is required for any committee loan approval: Vice-Chairman of the Bank, Chief Credit Officer or a Market President. A quorum requires at least three designated committee members to be in attendance. \n \u00b7 Loan officers are permitted within a 12-month period to approve up to $0.2 million in new credit per customer aggregate loan relationship. In cases where the aggregate credit size exceeds the loan credit officer's individual authority, the Bank President may approve the additional credit. \nComposition of Loan Portfolio. The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio at the dates indicated.\n\nTotal loans increased $211.5 million and $234.9 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, compared to the prior years. Loans in the Arizona and Colorado markets increased $62.1 million and $149.4 million, respectively from December 31, 2016.\nIn 2017, the Construction & land category increased $90.0 million and Real estate - mortgage loans increased $78.4 million, contributing 80.0% of the loan growth on a combined basis. In 2016, the Real estate - mortgage loan category contributed 65.9% of the loan portfolio growth, increasing $154.9 million. Other loan categories with modest growth in 2016 included Commercial ($42.4 million), Consumer ($13.7 million), and Other ($50.8 million) loans, while Construction & land declined $26.8 million.\nUnder state law, the aggregate amount of loans we can make to one borrower is generally limited to 15% of our unimpaired capital, surplus, undivided profits and allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 2017, our individual legal lending limit was $66.4 million. The Bank's Board of Directors has established an internal lending limit of $15.0 million for normal credit extensions and $20.0 million for the highest rated credits. To accommodate customers whose financing needs exceed our internal lending limits and to address portfolio concentration concerns, we may sell loan participations to outside participants. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the outstanding balance of loan participations sold by us was $20.7 million and $15.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had loan participations purchased from other banks totaling $130.8 million and $118.3 million, respectively. We use the same analysis in deciding whether to purchase a participation in a loan as we would in deciding whether to originate the same loan.\nDue to the nature of our business as a commercial banking institution, our lending relationships are typically larger than those of a retail bank. The following table describes the number of relationships and the percentage of the dollar value of the loan portfolio by the size of the credit relationship.\n\nThe majority of the loan relationships exceeding $3.0 million are in our real estate and commercial portfolios. At December 31, 2017 the Company had loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings in the amount of $454.3 million and loans to the healthcare and social assistance industry in the amount of $334.3 million that exceeded 10% of total loans. There were no other concentrations in excess of 10% of the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2017. The Company may be subject to additional regulatory supervisory oversight if its concentration in commercial real estate lending exceeds regulatory parameters. Pursuant to interagency\nguidance issued by the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies, supervisory criteria were put in place to define commercial real estate concentrations as:\n \u00b7 Construction, land development and other land loans that represent 100% or more of total risk-based capital; or \n \u00b7 Commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) that represent 300% or more of total risk-based capital and the real estate portfolio has increased more than 50% or more during the prior 36 months. \nAt December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's exposure to commercial real estate lending was below the parameters discussed above.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into various types of transactions that include commitments to extend credit. We apply the same credit standards to these commitments as we apply to our other lending activities and have included these commitments in our lending risk evaluations. Our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments. See Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion on our commitments.\nCommercial Loans. Commercial loans increased $32.8 million, or 2.7%, from $1.22 billion at December 31, 2016 to $1.25 billion at December 31, 2017. Commercial lending consists of loans to small and medium-sized businesses in a wide variety of industries. We provide a broad range of commercial loans, including lines of credit for working capital purposes and term loans for the acquisition of equipment and other purposes. Commercial loans are generally collateralized by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, real estate and other commercial assets, and may be supported by other credit enhancements such as personal guarantees. However, where warranted by the overall financial condition of the borrower, loans may be unsecured and based on the cash flow of the business.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's commercial loan portfolio, segregated by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).\n\nReal Estate - Mortgage Loans. Real estate mortgage loans increased $78.4 million, or 6.7%, from $1.17 billion at December 31, 2016 to $1.25 billion at December 31, 2017. Real estate mortgage loans include various types of loans for which we hold real property as collateral. We generally restrict commercial real estate lending activity to owner-occupied properties or to investor properties that are owned by customers with which we have a current banking relationship. We make commercial real estate loans at both fixed-and,floating-interest rates, with maturities generally ranging from five to 20 years. The Bank's underwriting standards generally require that a commercial real estate loan not exceed 75% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. In addition, we originate SBA 504 loans on owner-occupied properties with maturities of up to 25 years in which the SBA allows for financing of up to 90% of the project cost and takes a security position that is subordinated to us, as well as U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development loans.\nThe properties securing the Company's real estate mortgage loan portfolio are located primarily in the states of Colorado and Arizona. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, 68% and 67% of the Company's outstanding real estate mortgage loans were in the Colorado market, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's real estate mortgage portfolio, segregated by property type.\n\nConstruction and land. Construction and land increased $90.0 million, or 51.6%, from $174.5 million at December 31, 2016 to $264.4 million at December 31, 2017. We have a portfolio of loans for the acquisition and development of land for residential building projects. We also finance construction projects involving one- to four-family residences. We provide financing to residential developers that we believe have demonstrated a favorable record of accurately projecting completion dates and budgeting expenses. We provide loans for the construction of both pre-sold projects and projects built prior to the location of a specific buyer (speculative loan), although speculative loans are provided on a more selective basis. Residential construction loans are due upon the sale of the completed project and are generally collateralized by first liens on the real estate and have floating interest rates. In addition, these loans generally have credit enhancements in the form of personal guarantees to provide an additional source of repayment. We typically require a permanent financing commitment or prequalification be in place before we make a residential construction loan. Moreover, we generally monitor construction draws monthly and inspect property to ensure that construction is progressing as projected. Our underwriting standards generally require that the principal amount of a speculative loan be no more than 75% of the appraised value of the completed construction project or 80% of pre-sold projects. Values are determined primarily by approved independent appraisers.\nWe also originate loans to finance the construction of multi-family, office, industrial, retail and tax credit projects. These projects are predominantly owned by the user of the property, or are sponsored by financially strong developers who maintain an ongoing banking relationship with us. Our underwriting standards generally require that the principal amount of these loans be no more than 75% of the appraised value. Values are determined primarily by approved independent appraisers.\nConstruction and land loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the construction and land portfolio are generally located in the states of Colorado and Arizona. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, 76% and 71%, respectively, of the Company's construction and land loans outstanding were generated in the Colorado market.\nConsumer Loans. Consumer loans increased $15.1 million, or 5.7%, from $267.0 million at December 31, 2016 to $282.1 million at December 31, 2017. We provide a broad range of consumer loans to customers, including personal lines of credit, home equity loans and automobile loans. In order to improve customer service, continuity and customer retention, the same loan officer often services the banking relationships of both the business and business owners or management. We offer residential mortgage loans as part of our consumer mortgage products. This residential mortgage financing program offers competitive pricing and terms for the purchase, refinance or permanent financing of mortgage loans, with an average loan size of approximately $800,000. For primary residences, the standard loan-to-value is 80% for loans up to $1.5 million. The loan-to-value decreases as the size of the loan increases, with a standard loan-to-value of 55% on loans in excess of $3.0 million. In addition, we generally only finance 5/1, and 7/1 adjustable-rate mortgage loans as well as 15-year fixed-rate loans. Residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2017 and 2016, totaled $213.8 million or 80% and $197.9 million or 74%, respectively, of the consumer loan portfolio.\nOther loans. Other loans decreased $4.8 million, or 4.7%, from $103.8 million at December 31, 2016 to $98.9 million at December 31, 2017. Other loans include lending products such as taxable and tax-exempt\nleasing, not defined as commercial real estate, acquisition and development, construction, or consumer loans.\nNonperforming Assets\nOur nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, restructured loans, loans past due 90 days or more, OREO and other repossessed assets. Nonaccrual loans are those loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued. The following table sets forth information with respect to these assets at the dates indicated.\n\nAccrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, the borrower's financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful. A delinquent loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes 90 days past due. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all accrued and unpaid interest on the loan is reversed and deducted from either earnings as a reduction of reported interest income for current year interest or against the allowance for interest accrued in a prior year. No additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain. When the issues relating to a nonaccrual loan are finally resolved, there may ultimately be an actual write-down or charge-off of the principal balance of the loan, which may necessitate additional charges to earnings. Restructured loans are those for which concessions, including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to the borrower, or the reduction of interest or principal, have been granted due to the borrower's weakened financial condition. Interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur. Interest income that would have been recorded had nonaccrual loans performed in accordance with their original contract terms during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was immaterial due to the low level of nonaccrual loans during those periods. OREO represents real property taken by the Company either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu thereof from the borrower. Repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers. Subsequent to acquisition at fair value, repossessed assets and OREO are carried at the lesser of cost or fair market value, less selling costs. See Note 18 - Fair Value Measurements for additional discussion on the valuation of OREO assets.\nNonperforming assets increased $4.6 million to $12.9 million at December 31, 2017, from $8.4 million at December 31, 2016. The following table summarizes loans and nonperforming assets by type and market.\n\nThe Company's OREO portfolio consisted of two properties at December 31, 2017. The Company has entered into a contract to sell its largest OREO property, located in Colorado and comprising 97% of the overall OREO balance. The Company does not expect a material gain or loss on the disposition of this property. The Company has dedicated significant resources to the workout and resolution of nonaccrual loans and OREO, and continues to closely monitor the financial condition of its clients.\nIn addition to the nonperforming assets described above, the Company had 42 customer relationships considered by management to be potential problem loans with outstanding principal of approximately $27.7 million at December 31, 2017. A potential problem loan is one as to which management has concerns about the borrower's future performance under the terms of the loan contract. These loans are current as to the principal and interest and, accordingly, are not included in the nonperforming asset categories. However, further deterioration may result in the loan being classified as nonperforming. The level of potential problem loans is factored into the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses consists of three elements: (i) specific reserves determined in accordance with ASC Topic 310 - Receivables based on probable losses on specific loans; (ii) general reserves determined in accordance with guidance in ASC Topic 450 - Contingencies, based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company; and (iii) unallocated reserves, which is intended to capture potential misclassifications in the loan grading system.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's recognition of the risks of extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio. The allowance is maintained to provide for probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans and for probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is based on various factors affecting the loan portfolio, including a review of problem loans, business conditions, historical loss experience, evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral, and holding and disposal costs. The allowance is increased by additional charges to operating income and reduced by loans charged off, net of recoveries.\n\nAdditions to the allowance for loan losses, which are charged as expenses on our consolidated statements of income, are made periodically to maintain the allowances at the appropriate level, based on our analysis of the potential risk in the loan and commitment portfolios. Loans charged off, net of amounts recovered from previously charged off loans, reduce the allowance for loan losses. The amount of the allowance is a function of the levels of loans outstanding, the level of nonperforming loans, historical loan loss experience, amount of loan losses charged against the reserve during a given period and current economic conditions. Federal regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, review our loans and allowance for loan and credit losses. We believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover anticipated loan losses. However, management may determine a need to increase the allowances for loan losses, or regulators, when reviewing the Bank's loan and commitment portfolio in the future, may request the Bank increase such allowances. Either of these events could adversely affect our earnings. Further, there can be no assurance that actual loan losses will not exceed the allowances for loan losses.\nThe methodology used in the periodic review of reserve adequacy, which is performed at least quarterly, is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in actual and expected credit losses. These changes are reflected in both the general and unallocated reserves. The historical loss ratios and estimated risk factors related to segmenting our loan portfolio, which are key considerations in this analysis, are updated quarterly. The review of reserve adequacy is performed by executive management and presented to the Audit Committee quarterly for its review and consideration. For additional information on the Company's methodology for estimating the allowance for loan and credit losses, see Note 4 - Loans.\nThe table below provides an allocation of the allowance for loan and credit losses by loan type; however, allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories:\n\nWe believe that any allocation of the allowance into categories creates an appearance of precision that does not exist. The allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts, by loan classification, to be charged to the allowance. We believe that the table is a useful device for assessing the adequacy of the allowance as a whole. The allowance is utilized as a single unallocated allowance available for all loans. As part of the overall allowance, the Company maintains an unallocated portion that is intended to capture the inherent risk that certain loans may be assigned an incorrect loan grade. The Company determines the level of the unallocated allowance by reference to its migration of historical losses and the percentage of loans identified as incorrectly graded through the loan review process.\nThe Company recorded a $3.2 million provision for loan losses during 2017 compared to a $2.1 million provision for loan losses reversal during 2016. The provision for loan losses in 2017 was primarily a function of loan growth, while the negative provision in 2016 was due to improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio, loan loss recoveries and the release of a specific reserve on an impaired credit. Nonperforming assets increased $4.6 million, or 54.6% to $12.9 million at December 31, 2017 from $8.4 million a year earlier. The increase in nonperforming assets was due to nonaccrual loans, which increased but only represent 0.24% of the total loan portfolio. The Company had charge-offs of $0.9 million and $7.8 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company had recoveries of $2.3 million and $2.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Although the Company continues to record charge-offs, management believes that its credit quality outlook remains favorable and that the Company's allowance for loan and credit losses provides adequate coverage for probable loan and credit losses. The allowance for loan and credit losses to total loans was 1.21% and 1.13% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The allowance for loan and credit losses to nonperforming loans was 482.4% and 1,010.4% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. It is possible management may determine a need to increase the allowance for loan and credit losses due to changes in the factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan and credit losses. Such determination could have an adverse effect in the level of future loan and credit loss provisions and the Company's earnings.\nInvestments\nThe investment portfolio is primarily composed of residential MBS explicitly (GNMA) and implicitly (FNMA and FHLMC) backed by the U.S. Government, with the majority of the portfolio either maturing or repricing within one to five years. The portfolio does not include any securities exposed to sub-prime mortgage loans. The investment portfolio also includes single-issuer TPS and corporate debt securities. The corporate debt securities portfolio primarily consists of senior and subordinated debentures issued by the financial services industry. None of the issuing institutions are in default nor have interest payments on the TPS been deferred. Our investment strategies are reviewed in meetings of the ALCO.\nCertain TPS and corporate debt securities held by the Company are subject to deduction from regulatory capital under the Corresponding Deduction Approach promulgated in Basel III. As such, the Company expects its portfolio of TPS and corporate debt securities to decrease in future periods.\nThere were no security transfers between the available for sale and held to maturity categories during 2017.\nOur goals with respect to the investment portfolio are to:\n \u00b7 Maximize safety and soundness; \n \u00b7 Provide adequate liquidity; \n \u00b7 Maximize rate of return within the constraints of applicable liquidity requirements; and \n \u00b7 Complement asset/liability management strategies. \nThe following table sets forth the book value (fair value on AFS securities and amortized cost on HTM securities) of our investment portfolio by type at the dates indicated. See Note 3 - Investments for additional information.\n\nAt December 31, 2017, investments represented 14.02% of total assets compared to 14.06% at December 31, 2016. Available for sale securities had a net unrealized gain of $2.7 million at December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company's available for sale securities in a temporary unrealized loss position of $0.3 million consisted primarily of TPS. The fair value of these securities is expected to recover as the securities approach their stated maturity or repricing date.\nOther investments consist primarily of FHLB stock required to support a borrowing base with the FHLB. FHLB stock holdings are largely dependent upon the Company's liquidity position. To the extent the need for wholesale funding increases or decreases, the Company may purchase additional or sell excess FHLB stock, respectively. During 2017, other investments decreased $1.2 million due to net redemptions of FHLB stock.\nThe following table sets forth the book value, maturity and approximate yield of the securities in our investment portfolio at December 31, 2017. Other investments include stock in the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank, which have no maturity date. These investments have been included in the total column only.\n\n (1) Yields have been adjusted to reflect a tax-equivalent basis where applicable. \nExcluding securities issued by government-sponsored entities, the investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 did not include any single issuer for which the aggregate carrying amount exceeded 10% of shareholders' equity.\nOther Assets\nThe following table sets forth the values of our other miscellaneous assets at the dates indicated.\n\nIntangible Assets. Intangible assets primarily represent client relationship lists. The Company recognized $0.6 million of intangible asset amortization during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Other than amortization, no other activity occurred in intangible assets during 2017 and 2016.\nBOLI. BOLI increased $1.4 million in 2017 to $55.0 million at December 31, 2017 due to growth in the cash surrender values of the underlying policies. BOLI increased $4.3 million in 2016 to $53.7 million at December 31, 2016. During 2016, the Company purchased additional policies of $3.2 million, had an increase of $1.3 million due to growth in the cash surrender values of the underlying policies and claims of $0.2 million\nDeferred Income Taxes, Net. Deferred income taxes, net decreased $6.8 million in 2017 to $13.1 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily from the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction in the federal tax rate from the TCJA. The remeasurement resulted in a $7.2 million reduction in the net deferred income tax asset. Deferred income taxes decreased $2.3 million in 2016 to $19.9 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily from the tax effect of the $7.4 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses in 2016. Deferred income taxes are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. See Note 11 - Income Taxes for additional discussion of income taxes and deferred tax items.\nOther Real Estate Owned. During 2016 and 2017, the Company had no OREO activity. At December 31, 2017, the Company held two properties, with one Colorado property comprising over 97% of the total OREO balance. The Company has entered into a contract to sell the Colorado property and does not expect a material gain or loss on the disposition.\nOther Assets. Other assets increased $0.3 million during 2017 to $20.1 million at December 31, 2017. In 2016, other assets increased $1.8 million during 2016 to $19.8 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to a receivable from the Company's landlord on reimbursement for leasehold improvements on the new executive office lease. The reimbursement has been accounted for as an incentive and is being recognized as a reduction to rent over the lease term.\nDeposits\nOur primary source of funds has historically been customer deposits. We offer a variety of accounts for depositors, which are designed to attract both short- and long-term deposits. These accounts include CDs, money market accounts, savings accounts, checking accounts, and individual retirement accounts. We believe we receive a large amount of noninterest-bearing deposits because we provide customers the option\nof paying for treasury management services in cash or by maintaining additional noninterest-bearing account balances. The Company's noninterest-bearing deposits represented 46% and 42% of total deposits at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest-bearing accounts earn interest at rates based on competitive market factors and our desire to increase or decrease certain types of maturities or deposits.\nThe Company views its reciprocal CDARS and ICS accounts as customer-related deposits. The CDARS and ICS programs are provided through a third party and are designed to provide full FDIC insurance on deposit amounts by exchanging or reciprocating larger depository relationships with other member banks. Depositor funds are broken into smaller amounts and placed with other banks that are members of the network. Each member bank issues deposit amounts at a level that the entire deposit is eligible for FDIC insurance. CDARS and ICS are technically brokered deposits; however, the Company considers the reciprocal deposits placed through these programs as core funding due to the customer relationship that generated the transaction and does not report the balances as brokered sources in its internal or external financial reports. The Company had balances of $344.9 million and $327.8 million in CDARS and ICS accounts at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe following tables present the average balances for each major category of deposits and the weighted average interest rates paid for interest-bearing deposits for the periods indicated.\n\nMaturities of CDs of $100,000 and more at December 31, 2017, are as follows:\n\nDeposits overall increased $195.4 million or 6.5% and $288.1 million or 10.5% to $3.2 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in deposits during 2017 was due to noninterest-bearing demand deposits which increased $191.2 million.\nShort-Term Borrowings\nOur short-term borrowings include federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which generally mature within 90 days or less, and a line of credit with the FHLB typically used as an overnight borrowing source.\nThe following table sets forth information related to our short-term borrowings during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below and Note 8 - Borrowed Funds for further discussion.\n\nThe following tables contain supplemental information on securities sold under agreements to repurchase during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The Company uses Customer Repurchases as a way to enhance our customers' interest-earning ability. We do not consider Customer Repurchases to be a wholesale funding source but rather an additional treasury management service provided to our customer base.\n\nLong-Term Debt\nThe following table sets forth information relating to our subordinated debentures and notes payable.\n\nFor a discussion of long-term debt and for certain financial information for each issuance, see Note 9 - Long-Term Debt.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, certain information related to our results of operations, followed by discussion of the major components of revenues, expense and performance.\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, the Company ceased the operations of its investment banking division. The table below reports, for all periods presented, the results of operations associated with this business line as discontinued operations, net of tax. See Note 2 - Discontinued Operations for additional information.\n\nEarnings Performance. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $32.9 million, a 5.7% decrease from $34.9 million in 2016. The decrease in net income was due to a $7.2 million increase in tax expense as a result of the TCJA. The increase to tax expense also reduced the return on average assets and equity. Return on average assets decreased to 0.87% for 2017 compared to 1.02% in 2016. Return on average shareholders' equity decreased to 10.27% from 12.15% in 2016.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $34.9 million, a 33.9% increase from $26.1 million in 2015. Return on average assets increased to 1.02% in 2016 compared to 0.83% a year earlier. Return on\naverage shareholders' equity also increased in 2016 to 12.15% from 8.77% in 2015. The financial improvement in 2016 was due to an increase in net interest income of $4.4 million and a decrease of $8.5 million in the provision for loan losses in 2016 over 2015.\nEarnings per common share on a diluted basis for the year ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, was $0.78, $0.84 and $0.62, respectively.\nNet Interest Income. The largest component of our net income is our net interest income. NII is the difference between interest income, principally from loans and investment securities, and interest expense, principally on customer deposits and borrowings. Changes in NII result from changes in volume, net interest spread and net interest margin. Volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin refers to NII divided by average interest-earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe majority of our assets are interest-earning and our liabilities are interest-bearing. Accordingly, changes in interest rates may impact our net interest margin. The FOMC uses the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate used by banks to lend to each other, to influence interest rates and the national economy. Changes in the federal funds rate have a direct correlation to changes in one month Libor and the the prime rate, the underlying indeces for most of the floating-rate loans issued by the Company. The target federal funds rate was held at a range of 0-25 basis points between December 2008 and December 2015. On December 17, 2015, the FOMC increased the target rate to 25-50 basis points, the first increase since June 2006. The target rate was increased another 100 basis points between 2016-2017 and is at a range of 125-150 basis at December 31, 2017. As the Company is asset sensitive, low rates negatively impact the Company's earnings and NIM and the Company benefits as the target rate increases.\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, certain information related to our average asset and liability structure and our average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities. Such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. NII and NIM are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis to recognize the income tax savings when comparing taxable and tax-exempt assets. The taxable-equivalent NII and NIM in the following table were computed using the applicable state tax rate and a 35.0% federal tax rate. Beginning in 2018, the taxable-equivalent NII and NIM\nwill be calculated using a 21.0% federal tax rate due to the enactment of the TCJA. Assuming no other changes, NII and NIM will be reduced in future periods due to the decrease in the federal income tax rate.\n\n (1) Interest earned has been adjusted to reflect tax-exempt assets on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. \n (2) Loan fees included in interest income were $5.8 million, $6.0 million and $5.7 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Nonaccrual loans are included in average loans outstanding. \n (3) Yields have been adjusted to reflect a taxable-equivalent basis where applicable. \nThe following table illustrates, for the periods indicated, the changes in the levels of interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in volume or rate. Changes in net interest income due to both volume and rate have been included in the changes due to rate column.\n\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $316.4 million to $3.63 billion at December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase of $252.6 million in the loan portfolio and $74.2 million in the investment portfolio. Taxable-equivalent net interest income grew $16.0 million due to the growth in the loan portfolio. The yield on earning assets increased 11 basis points, from 4.09% to 4.20% in 2017, primarily due to a 12 basis point increase in the yield on the loan portfolio.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $143.7 million during 2017 to $2.03 billion. The increase was due to a $106.1 million increase in interest-bearing deposits and a $37.6 million increase in Customer Repurchases and short-term borrowings. The average cost of liabilities was 0.62% in both 2017 and 2016. Although the cost of short-term borrowings increased 53 basis points in 2017 due to the increase in the target federal funds rate, the overall cost of deposits remained stable at 13 basis points in both 2017 and 2016.\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $268.2 million to $3.31 billion at December 31, 2016. The loan portfolio increased $275.8 million in 2016, while the investment portfolio declined $15.9 million, the sixth consecutive year the investment portfolio has declined. Taxable-equivalent net interest income grew $6.2 million due to the growth in interest-earning assets, primarily in the loan portfolio. In addition, net interest income included 366 days in 2016 due to the leap year, compared to 365 days in 2015. The yield on earning assets declined nine basis points, from 4.18% to 4.09% in 2016, primarily due to a lower yield on the loan portfolio. In October 2016, the Company entered into two interest-rate swaps to hedge the cash flows on a portion of its LIBOR-based loan portfolio. The swaps have a weighted average term of six years and a combined notional value of $100.0 million. The Company pays a variable rate based on 1-month LIBOR and receives a weighted average fixed-rate of 1.20%.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased $123.4 million during 2016 to $1.88 billion. The increase was due to an $83.8 million increase in interest-bearing deposits and a $39.6 million net increase in Customer Repurchases and short/long-term borrowings. The average cost of liabilities increased in 2016, to 0.62%, from 0.55% in 2015. The increase in the yield on interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to the increase in the target federal funds rate in December 2015, which increased short-term borrowing costs in 2016.\nThe Company has executed a series of interest-rate swap transactions designated as cash flow hedges. The swaps fix the effective interest rate for payments due on the junior subordinated debentures with the objective of reducing the Company's exposure to adverse changes in cash flows relating to payments on its LIBOR-\nbased floating rate debt. The weighted average interest rate paid (fixed-rate) was 5.44%, 5.44% and 5.48% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decline in the rate during 2016 was due to the maturity of a swap in early 2015 with a fixed-rate of 6.04% that was replaced with a new swap with a fixed-rate of 4.99%. The remaining contractual maturities of the swaps vary between 2 and 6 years. Certain terms of the cash flow hedges are as follows:\n\nProvision and Allowance for Loan Losses. The following table presents provision for loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n\nThe Company recorded a loan loss provision of $3.3 million, ($2.1) million, and $6.4 million during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in the provision for loan losses in 2017 was primarily due to loan growth, an additional allowance segmentation on a pool of investor office loans within the Denver market and an increase in classified loans. Partially offsetting these items were net recoveries of $1.36 million.\nThe decrease in the provision for loan losses in 2016 was primarily due to the reversal of a $2.3 million specific reserve on an impaired credit, recoveries of $2.5 million and a decrease in multi-family lending, a category with a higher reserve allocation. Partially offsetting these items were loan growth and a $6.8 million increase in classified loans in 2016.\nNonperforming loans to total loans were 0.25%, 0.11%, and 0.60% at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan and credit losses was $37.9 million or 1.21% of total loans compared to $33.3 million or 1.13% of total loans at December 31, 2016.\nNoninterest Income. The following table presents noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n\nService Charges. Deposit service charges primarily consist of fees earned from our treasury management services. Customers are given the option to pay for these services in cash or by offsetting the fees for these services against an earnings credit that is given for maintaining noninterest-bearing deposits. Fees earned from treasury management services will fluctuate based on the number of customers using the services and from changes in U.S. Treasury rates which are used as a benchmark for the earnings credit rate. Other miscellaneous deposit charges are transactional by nature and may not be consistent period over period. As the earnings credit rate increases, the amount of cash fees paid for service charges decreases. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company evaluated and increased the rates assessed for treasury management services which increased 2017 income.\nInvestment Advisory Income. Investment advisory income increased $0.5 million or 8.9% to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, advisory income decreased $0.1 million or 2.0% to $5.7 million compared to 2015. Revenue from this source is generally a function of the value of Assets Under Management (AUM) on the last day of each quarter. Discretionary AUM at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $974.3 million and $844.5 million, respectively. Average AUM was $908.7 million, $831.8 million and $876.0, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Revenue from investment advisory income benefits from market appreciation and is negatively impacted from market depreciation.\nInsurance Income. Insurance income is derived from two main areas: benefits consulting and P&C. Revenue from benefits consulting and P&C are recurring revenue sources as policies and contracts generally renew or rewrite on an annual or more frequent basis. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, insurance revenue was composed of the following:\n\nGrowth in benefits consulting was the primary cause of the $0.6 million increase in insurance income in 2017. In 2015 and 2016, the average P&C rate for the industry declined. As our revenue is typically derived as percentage of the premium, this negatively impacted revenue. At the same time, the Company's benefits consulting division has continued to grow. The combination of these two factors has caused the shift in the percentage of revenue in the table above.\nOther Income. Other income is composed of changes in the cash surrender value of BOLI, earnings on other investments, loan and commitment fees, merchant and bankcard fees, customer swap fees, wire transfer fees, foreign exchange fees and safe deposit income.\nOther income decreased $1.8 million to $8.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a $2.9 million increase to $9.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in 2017 is due to a $1.2 million decrease in income from other investments and a $0.5 million decrease in customer swap fees. Other investments consist primarily of funds licensed as Small Business Investment Companies. The Company's income from these funds will vary based on transactions occurring within the funds.\nOther income increased $2.9 million to $9.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to a $1.5 million increase to $6.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in 2016 is due to a $1.2 million increase in income from other investments and a $1.0 million increase in customer swap fees.\nNoninterest Expense. The following table presents noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n\nOur efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis was 62.46% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 66.8% and 67.9% for 2016 and 2015, respectively (see non-GAAP reconciliation included in\nItem 6. Selected Financial Data). The efficiency ratio is a measure of the Company's overhead, measuring the percentage of each dollar of income that is paid in operating expenses. In 2017 the Company was successful in improving its operating leverage by growing net interest income while limiting the growth in expenses. The Company maintains its goal of reducing the efficiency ratio over the next few years and is committed to exploring cost-reduction strategies. However, assuming no other changes, the TCJA will cause the efficiency ratio to increase in 2018 due to the reduction in taxable-equivalent net interest income discussed above. Further increases in the federal funds target rate by the FOMC would benefit the Company's net interest income and efficiency ratio.\nSalaries and Employee Benefits. The Company's full-time equivalent employee base at the end of 2017 was 538 compared to 533 in 2016.\nSalaries and employee benefits increased $3.6 million or 5.1% during the year ended December 31, 2017. Contributing to the increase in 2017 was a $2.1 million increase in salaries and a $1.4 million increase in bonus expense. Salaries increased due to the annual cost of living and merit increases effective in the second quarter of 2017 and the increase in full-time equivalent employees.\nSalaries and employee benefits increased $1.9 million or 2.8% during the year ended December 31, 2016. Contributing to the increase in 2016 was a $0.9 million increase in salaries and commission expense, $0.6 million increase in 401(k) matching expense and a $0.5 million increase in insurance benefits. Salaries were also impacted by the annual cost of living and merit increases effective in the second quarter of 2016, offset by a decrease in severance expense in 2016. The Company has a 401(k) matching program that is based on the overall profitability of the Company. Based on the Company's financial performance in 2016, an additional match of $0.5 million was made in 2016 that was not made in 2015. The Company is partially self-insured on its medical and dental programs. Insurance benefits will vary based on participant claims. In 2016, the Company's participants experienced several large claims that increased our insurance expense.\nIncluded in salaries and employee benefits is expense related to share-based compensation used to retain existing employees and to recruit new employees. The Company expects to continue using share-based compensation in the future as it is considered an important part of overall compensation. Costs associated with the plan are influenced by the number of participants in the Company's stock bonus pool and the proportion of incentive compensation paid in cash versus stock.\nOccupancy Expenses, Premises and Equipment. Occupancy expenses consist primarily of rent, utilities, property taxes, insurance, depreciation and information systems maintenance. Occupancy costs decreased $0.3 million or 2.0% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. In January 2016, the Company signed a new lease agreement for its principal executive offices and recognized seven months of expense related to the lease in 2016, in addition to a full year of expense on the former principal executive office lease that terminated on December 31, 2016. The transition cost of maintaining leases on two locations did not reocurr in 2017. Occupancy costs increased $1.9 million or 14.4% during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in 2016 was due to the cost of maintaining leases on two locations for part of 2016.\nFDIC and Other Assessments. FDIC and other assessments consist of premiums paid by the FDIC-insured institutions and by Colorado chartered banks. The assessments by the FDIC and the Colorado Division of Banking are based on statutory and risk classification factors. The decrease in 2017 and 2016 was due to a statutory reduction in assessment rates in the second half of 2016.\nNet Gain on Securities, Other Assets and Other Real Estate Owned. The Company recognized gains on securities, other assets and OREO of $0.5 million, $0.1 million and $0.4 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Net gains on securities for the years presented were primarily from securities called/redeemed.\nOther Expense. Other operating expenses increased $0.1 million and $1.1 million, in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in 2016 was partially due to an increase in professional service costs related to\nthe Company's process and efficiency evaluations conducted in 2016. The Company has continued to see an increase in expenses in this area due to ongoing regulatory compliance and information technology projects.\nFederal Income Taxes. The effective tax rate was 38.4%, 25.9%, and 26.9% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2017 was due to a $7.2 million increase to tax expense from the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the TCJA. The decrease in the corporate tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% is expected to reduce the Company's effective tax rate in 2018.\nPermanent differences, primarily arising from changes in the cash surrender value of BOLI and tax-exempt income are the primary activities impacting the effective tax rate in each year.\nSegment Results\nThe Company has three segments: Commercial Banking, Fee-Based Lines, and Corporate Support and Other. See Note 19 - Segments for additional discussion regarding segments. Certain financial metrics of each segment are presented below.\nCommercial Banking.\n\nThe Commercial Banking segment reported net income of $39.0 million and $40.2 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. Volume increases in our interest earning assets and an increase in yield were the primary reasons for the increase in net interest income. Average loans increased $252.6 million and the yield on interest-earning assets increased 11 basis points in 2017. The growth in the loan portfolio also resulted in an increase to our provision for loan losses, which increased $5.2 million in 2017 over 2016. Noninterest expense decreased $4.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016, partially due to a decline in occupancy costs associated with the Company's move to a new headquarters location in 2016. In addition, certain centralized expenses included in the Commercial Banking segment in 2016 were moved to the Corporate Support segment in 2017. The provision for income taxes increased $9.3 million in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher pre-tax income and the impact of the TCJA.\nThe Commercial Banking segment reported net income of $40.2 million and $29.8 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. Volume increases in our interest earning assets was the primary reason for the increase in net interest income. Average loans were $275.8 million higher in 2016 than in 2015, which muted the effect of lower yields on interest-earning assets. Asset quality improvements and recoveries on charged-off loans resulted in a loan loss provision reversal of $1.8 million. Noninterest income grew in 2016, primarily due to $1.2 million in fees generated from the sale of interest rate swaps.\nFee-Based Lines.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2015, the Company ceased operations of GMB, a provider of investment banking services that was a component of the Fee-Based Lines segment. The decision was based in part by increasing regulatory compliance costs related to maintaining GMB's broker-dealer license and earnings volatility which was highly dependent on deal volume. Results for GMB for 2015 have been reclassified as discontinued operations. See Note 2 - Discontinued Operations for additional discussion.\nNet loss in the Fee-Based Lines segment decreased $0.8 million in 2017 compared to 2016. An increase in noninterest income of $1.1 million, while noninterest expense remained relatively flat, was the primary reason for the improvement. The increase in tax expense from the TCJA also impacted the Fee-Based Lines, increasing tax expense by $0.5 million. Absent the increase in tax expense from the TCJA, the segment would have reported a positive net income.\nNet loss in the Fee-Based Lines segment increased $0.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Lower investment advisory and insurance revenue coupled with higher salary and benefit costs contributed to the net loss in 2016. At December 31, 2016, AUM decreased $14.7 million during 2016 to $844.5 million from $859.2 million at the end of 2015. Average AUM in 2016 was $831.8 million compared to $876.0 million in 2015. Noninterest expense in the segment is predominately compensation-related, which is primarily variable and directly related to revenue. However, as the Company invests in new production staff, compensation as a percentage of revenue for those employees is higher in the earlier years until those new producers build a revenue base.\nCorporate Support and Other.\n\nThe Corporate Support and Other segment consists of activities of the Parent; non-production, back-office support operations; and eliminating transactions in consolidation. Non-production, back-office operations include human resources, accounting and finance, audit and compliance, information technology, Special Assets Group, and loan and deposit operations. The Company has a process for allocating these support\noperations back to the production lines based on an internal allocation methodology that is updated annually. Noninterest expense includes salaries and benefits of employees of the Parent and support functions as well as the nonemployee overhead operating costs not directly associated with another segment.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the segment reported a net loss of $5.7 million, an increase of $1.6 million from 2016. Lower noninterest income was due to the earnings on the Company's investments in mezzanine funds, which decreased in 2017 compared to 2016. Continued investment in the operational redesign of the Company's credit process, business intelligence and other consulting services resulted in an increase in noninterest expense during 2017.\nThe segment reported a net loss of $4.1 million in 2016 compared to a net loss of $3.2 million in the prior year. Lower net interest income was the result of additional interest expense of $1.7 million in 2016 relating to the Notes and lower interest income due to a prior-year recapture of $1.0 million of interest income on problem loan resolutions. Higher salary, health insurance, facility rents and service contract costs resulted in an increase in noninterest expense during 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses relates to a portfolio of loans purchased by the Parent from the Bank. This portfolio has steadily decreased since the 2009 purchase due to loan repayments and collateral sales. The declining balance of the portfolio and the overall asset quality improvement has contributed to the trend of declining provision for loan losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity refers to the Company's ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet financial obligations to its customers and shareholders in order to fund loans, to respond to deposit outflows and to cover operating expenses. Maintaining a level of liquid funds through asset/liability management seeks to ensure that these needs are met at a reasonable cost. Liquidity is essential to compensate for fluctuations in the balance sheet and provide funds for growth and normal operating expenditures. Sources of funds include customer deposits, scheduled amortization of loans, loan prepayments, scheduled maturities and calls of investments and prepayments from mortgage-backed securities. Liquidity needs may also be met by deposit growth, converting assets into cash, raising funds in the brokered CD market or borrowing using lines of credit with correspondent banks, the FHLB or the FRB. Longer-term liquidity needs may be met by selling securities available for sale or raising additional capital.\nLiquidity management is the process by which the Company manages the continuing flow of funds necessary to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. The objective of liquidity management is to ensure the Company has the ability to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to allow us to sustain our operations. These funding commitments include withdrawals by depositors, credit commitments to borrowers, shareholder dividends, debt payments, expenses of our operations and capital expenditures. Liquidity is monitored and closely managed by ALCO, a group of senior officers from the lending, deposit gathering, finance and treasury areas. ALCO's primary responsibilities are to ensure the necessary level of funds are available for normal operations as well as maintain a contingency funding policy to ensure that liquidity stress events are quickly identified and management plans are in place to respond. This is accomplished through the use of policies which establish limits and require measurements to monitor liquidity trends, including management reporting that identifies the amounts and costs of all available funding sources.\nThe Company's current liquidity position is expected to be more than adequate to fund expected asset growth. Historically, our primary source of funds has been customer deposits. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments - which are influenced by fluctuations in the general level of interest rates, returns available on other investments, competition, economic conditions, and other factors - are less predictable.\nLiquidity from asset categories is provided through cash and interest-bearing deposits with other banks, which totaled $80.2 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $96.1 million at December 31, 2016. Additional asset liquidity sources include principal and interest payments from securities in the Company's investment portfolio and loan portfolio. Liability liquidity sources include attracting deposits at competitive rates and maintaining wholesale borrowing (short-term borrowings and brokered CDs) credit relationships.\nThe Company's loan to core deposit ratio increased to 97.5% at December 31, 2017, from 96.8% at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $77.6 million and $106.2 million in outstanding wholesale borrowings, respectively. Average wholesale borrowings were $108.7 million and $84.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nThe Company uses various forms of short-term borrowings for cash management and liquidity purposes, regularly accessing its federal funds and FHLB lines to manage its daily cash position. At December 31, 2017, the Bank has approved federal funds purchase lines with eight correspondent banks with an aggregate credit line of $180.0 million. The Bank also has a line of credit from the FHLB that is limited by the amount of eligible collateral available to secure it and the Company's investment in FHLB stock. Borrowings under the FHLB line are required to be secured by unpledged securities and qualifying loans. Borrowings may also be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity or repricing intervals of assets.\nAvailable funding through correspondent lines and the FHLB at December 31, 2017, totaled $709.2 million or 19.2% of the Company's earning assets. Available funding consisted of $180.0 million of federal fund lines and $529.2 million in secured FHLB borrowing capacity. Access to funding through correspondent lines is dependent upon the cash position of the correspondent banks and there may be times when certain lines are not available. In addition, certain lines require a one day rest period after a specified number of consecutive days of accessing the lines. The Company believes it has sufficient borrowing capacity and diversity in correspondent banks to meet its needs.\nAt the holding company level, our primary sources of funds are dividends paid from the Bank and fee-based subsidiaries, management fees assessed to the Bank and the Fee-Based Lines, proceeds from the issuance of common stock, and other capital markets activity. The main use of this liquidity is the quarterly payment of dividends on our common stock, quarterly interest payments on the subordinated debentures and notes payable, payments for mergers and acquisitions activity, and payments for the salaries and benefits for the employees of the holding company.\nThe Company also maintains a revolving line of credit for an aggregate amount of up to $20.0 million, all of which was available at December 31, 2017. The line of credit has a one year term and matures in May 2018. Funds drawn will be used for general corporate purposes and backup liquidity.\nThe approval of the Colorado State Banking Board is required prior to the declaration of any dividend by the Bank if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits for the preceding two years. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 provides that the Bank cannot pay a dividend if it will cause the Bank to be undercapitalized.\u201d At December 31, 2017, the Bank was not otherwise restricted in its ability to pay dividends to the holding company. The Company's ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends upon the availability of dividends from the Bank, earnings from its Fee-Based Lines, and upon the Company's compliance with the capital adequacy guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (see Note 17 - Regulatory Matters). The holding company has a liquidity policy that requires the maintenance of at least 18 months of liquidity on the balance sheet based on projected cash usages, exclusive of dividends from the Bank. At December 31, 2017, the Company had a liquidity position that exceeds the policy limit, and we believe the Company has the ability to continue paying dividends.\nNet loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $0.1 million, which reasonably approximated the cash flows of those operations not separately stated in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows.\nShareholders' equity was $329.3 million and $302.3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Changes in shareholders' equity are due to the following:\n\nWe anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents, expected cash flows from continuing operations together with alternative sources of funding are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital, loan originations, capital expenditures and other obligations for at least the next 12 months. We continually monitor existing and alternative financing sources to support our capital and liquidity needs, including but not limited to, debt issuance, common stock issuance and deposit funding sources. Based on our current financial condition and our results of operations, we believe the Company will be able to sustain its ability to raise adequate capital through one or more of these financing sources.\nWe are subject to minimum risk-based capital limitations as set forth by federal banking regulations at both the consolidated Company level and the Bank level. Under the risk-based capital guidelines, different categories of assets, including certain off-balance sheet items, such as loan commitments in excess of one year and letters of credit, are assigned different risk weights, based generally on the perceived credit risk of the asset. These risk weights are multiplied by corresponding asset balances to determine a risk-weighted\u201d asset base. For purposes of the risk-based capital guidelines, total capital is defined as the sum of Common Equity Tier 1,\u201d Additional Tier 1\u201d and Tier 2\u201d capital elements. Common Equity Tier 1 consists of common stock, related surplus and retained earnings. Additional Tier 1 capital includes, with certain restrictions, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, certain grandfathered regulatory capital instruments and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries. Tier 2 capital includes, with certain limitations, perpetual preferred stock not included in Tier 1 capital, subordinated debt, certain maturing capital instruments, and the allowance for loan and credit losses.\nBeginning in 2016, the CCB requirement became effective for banking organizations. The CCB is designed to establish a capital range above minimum requirements to insulate banks from periods of stress and discourage unacceptable practices that may shift certain risks from an organization's shareholders to its depositors. When the capital buffer is breached, an organization's ability to pay dividends, execute share repurchases and make discretionary bonus payments may be limited to varying degrees depending on the severity of the breach. When fully phased-in in 2019, the CCB adds a 2.5% capital requirement above existing regulatory minimum ratios. At December 31, 2017, the Bank and Holding Company maintained capital buffers in excess of the fully phased-in requirements and were not subject to additional constraints on distributions, share repurchases or discretionary bonus payments beyond existing limits. At December 31, 2017, the Bank was well-capitalized with all capital ratios exceeding the well-capitalized requirement.\nSee Note 17 - Regulatory Matters for additional capital ratio disclosure. In order to comply with the regulatory capital constraints, the Company and its Board of Directors constantly monitor the capital level and its anticipated needs based on the Company's growth. The Company has identified sources of additional capital that could be used if needed, and monitors the costs and benefits of these sources, which include both the public and private markets.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements do not reflect various off-balance sheet commitments that are made in the normal course of business, which may involve some liquidity risk. Off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in the following Contractual Obligations and Commitments section. The Company has commitments to extend credit under lines of credit and stand-by letters of credit. The Company has also committed to investing in certain partnerships. See the following section of this report and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on these commitments.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nSummarized below are the Company's contractual obligations (excluding deposit liabilities) to make future payments at December 31, 2017:\n\n (1) Interest on these obligations has been excluded due to the short-term nature of the instruments. \n (2) Principal repayment of the $72.2 million in junior subordinated debentures is assumed to be at the contractual maturity, currently beyond five years. Interest of $14.8 million on the junior subordinated debentures is calculated at the fixed-rate associated with the applicable hedging instrument through the instrument maturity date (see Note 10 - Derivatives) and is reported in the due within\u201d categories during which the interest expense is expected to be incurred. Interest payments on junior subordinated debentures after maturity of the related fixed interest rate swap hedges are variable and no estimate of those payments has been included in the preceding table. The weighted average variable-rate applicable to the junior subordinated debentures as of the date of this report is 3.90% and ranges from 3.14% to 4.55%. \n (3) Principal repayment of the $60.0 million in Notes issued in June 2015 is assumed to be at the contractual maturity, currently beyond five years. Interest of $25.6 million on the Notes is calculated at an annual fixed-rate of 5.625% through June 2025 and is reported in the due within\u201d categories during which the interest expense is expected to be incurred. From June 25, 2025 to maturity on June 25, 2030, the Notes will bear interest at a floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 317 basis points. No estimate of interest payments during the floating rate period is included in the preceding table. \nThe contractual amount of the Company's financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, expiring by period at December 31, 2017, is presented below:\n\nThe Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the liquidity, credit enhancement and financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet. Credit risk is the principal risk associated with these instruments. The contractual amounts of these instruments represent the amount of credit risk should the instruments be fully drawn upon and the customer defaults.\nTo control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit, the Company uses the same credit quality, collateral policies and monitoring controls in making commitments and letters of credit as it does with its lending activities. The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation.\nLegally binding commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Standby letters of credit obligate the Company to meet certain financial obligations of its customers if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the customers are unable to do so. The financial standby letters of credit issued by the Company are irrevocable. Payment is only guaranteed under these letters of credit upon the borrower's failure to perform its obligations to the beneficiary.\nApproximately $52.8 million of total commitments at December 31, 2017 represent commitments to extend credit at fixed-rates of interest, which exposes the Company to some degree of interest rate risk.\nThe Company has also entered into interest-rate swap agreements under which it is required to either receive or pay cash to a counterparty depending on changes in interest rates. The interest-rate swaps are carried at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates at the balance sheet date. Interest-rate swaps recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017, do not represent amounts that will ultimately be received or paid under the contract and are therefore excluded from the table above.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs. Unlike most retail or manufacturing companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution such as the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, the impact of interest rates on a financial institution's performance is generally greater than the impact of inflation. Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or to the same extent, as the prices of goods and services, increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates. Over short periods of time, interest rates may not move in the same direction, or at the same magnitude, as inflation.", "item_7_tables": "Table 34: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCorporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSupport\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCommercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFee-Based\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nand\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nBanking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating revenue (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n151,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n19,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(6,205)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n164,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n39,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(397)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(5,687)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n32,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating revenue (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n137,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(5,074)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n150,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n40,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,208)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(4,058)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n34,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating revenue (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n127,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n17,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,870)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n142,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(542)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(3,175)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n26,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>Table 36: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommercial Banking operating revenue increased 10.5% in 2017 to $151.4 million, while net income decreased 2.9% to $39.0 million.

condition and results of operations for a financial holding company serving professionals, small and medium-sized businesses, and high-net-worth individuals. Key highlights include:\n\n- Growth from total assets of $160.4 million in 1995 to $3.8 billion in 2017.\n- Earnings derived primarily from net interest income and noninterest income from fee-based lines and service fees.\n- Strategies to enhance financial performance, including aligning employee compensation with company objectives, strengthening internal networking, and improving operational efficiencies.\n- Actions to reduce noninterest expense and enhance shareholder return, such as conducting a comprehensive review of staffing and expenditures and completing a thorough analysis of loan origination and credit underwriting processes.\n- Consideration of financial objectives to achieve double-digit growth in earnings per share.\n- Ongoing evaluation of operations resulting in some bank location closures and relocations, including consolidating two bank locations in downtown Denver into one and relocating principal executive offices.\n- Discontinuation of the investment banking division in 2015 with its operations reported as discontinued.\n- Analysis of key financial performance measures and operational results for 2017 and 2016, highlighting net income, operating revenue, net recovery, and capital ratios.\n- Disclosure of critical accounting policies, particularly the allowance for loan losses and fair value measurements.\n\nFor 2017, the company saw a net income decrease of 5.7% to $32.9 million primarily due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which led to increased tax expenses. The report also covers the company's liquidity and capital resources, confirming that anticipated cash requirements, including operating expenses, dividends, and growth initiatives, are expected to be met through the current liquidity position and cash flow projections."}
