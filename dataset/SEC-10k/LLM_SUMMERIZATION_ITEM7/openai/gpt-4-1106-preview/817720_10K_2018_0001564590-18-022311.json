This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those set forth elsewhere in this report and under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOverview\nWe are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed human interface semiconductor product solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing, communications, entertainment, and other electronic devices. We believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus and the strength of our intellectual property and our engineering know-how, which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of our OEMs.\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, and title has transferred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Our net revenue increased from $947.5 million for fiscal 2014 to $1,630.3 million for fiscal 2018, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 14.5%. For fiscal 2014, we derived 27.2% of our net revenue from the personal computer market and 72.8% of our net revenue from the mobile product applications market. For fiscal 2018, revenue from the personal computer market accounted for 15.8% of our net revenue, revenue from the mobile product applications market accounted for 62.6% of our net revenue, and revenue from the IoT product applications market accounted for 21.6% of our net revenue.\nMany of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in Armenia, China, Denmark, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States, we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis.\nOur manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers' facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next 90 days. However, we do not have any long-term supply contracts with any of our contract manufacturers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials, logistics, amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology, backlog, and supplier arrangements, manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers, and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value to cost of revenue.\nOur gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers' products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin.\nOur research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human interface solutions for OEM customers prior to and after their commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives' commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities.\nAcquired intangibles amortization is the amortization of the cost of our acquired intangible assets related to customer relationships and tradenames which are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 7 years.\nImpairment of acquired intangibles represents the reduction of the carrying value of intangibles which have been determined unrecoverable.\nRestructuring costs primarily reflect severance and facilities consolidation costs related to restructuring of our operations to reduce operating costs. These headcount- and facilities-related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative. See Note 13 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nThe litigation settlement charge reflects costs recorded in connection with certain legal proceedings further discussed under Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nEquity investment loss includes amortization of intangible assets reflected under the equity method of accounting in connection with our investment in OXi Technology Ltd. (see Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report).\nAcquisitions and Financing Activities\nOn June 11, 2017, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Conexant Systems, LLC, (the Conexant Acquisition\u201d). The Conexant Acquisition is intended to increase our presence in the smart home market and increase opportunities to grow revenue. Effective July 25, 2017, or the Closing Date, we completed the Conexant Acquisition. The results of Conexant are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period from July 25, 2017 through June 30, 2018. For further discussion of the Conexant Acquisition, see Note 4 included in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nOn June 11, 2017, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the multimedia solutions business of Marvell (the Marvell Business Acquisition\u201d). The Marvell Business Acquisition is also intended to increase our presence in the smart home market and increase opportunities to grow revenue. Effective September 8, 2017, we completed the Marvell Business Acquisition. The results of Marvell are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period from September 8, 2017 through June 30, 2018. For further discussion of the Marvell Business Acquisition, see Note 4 included in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nOn June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the several initial purchasers named therein (collectively, the Initial Purchasers\u201d), pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and the Initial Purchasers agreed to purchase, $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the Notes\u201d) in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds from the Offering, after deducting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $514.5 million, which includes proceeds from the exercise of the Initial Purchasers' option to purchase additional Notes. The Offering was completed on June 26, 2017. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, product warranty, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, tax contingencies, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe methods, estimates, interpretations, and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC considers an entity's most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of the entity's financial condition and results of operations and those that require the entity's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, and title has transferred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. We accrue for estimated sales returns, incentives, and other allowances at the time we recognize revenue. Our products contain embedded firmware and software, which together with, or consisting of, our ASIC chip, deliver the essential functionality of our products and, as such, software revenue recognition guidance is not applicable. The majority of our sales to distributors are made under agreements that generally do not provide for price adjustments after purchase and provide for only limited return rights under product warranty. Revenue on these sales is recognized in the same manner as sales to our non-distributor customers. Some of our sales are to distributors which have limited stock rotation rights, which allow them to rotate a small portion of product in their inventory a maximum of two times per year. We recognize revenue to these distributors upon shipment of product to the distributor, as the stock rotation rights are limited and we can reasonably estimate expected product returns when right of return exists. When sales rebates, price allowances and stock rotations are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized.\nInventory\nWe state our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We base our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories on our projections of future demand and market conditions. Sudden declines in demand, rapid product improvements, or technological changes, or any combination of these factors can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories. On an ongoing basis, we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their net realizable value based on our forecasts of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts, additional inventory write-downs may be required. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected decline in demand, rapid product improvements and technological advances, and termination or changes by our OEM customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions.\nPeriodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In those circumstances, we record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe have applied significant estimates and judgments in order to determine the fair value of the identified assets acquired, liabilities assumed, goodwill recognized, and contingent consideration recorded in connection with our business combinations to ensure the value of the assets and liabilities acquired are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. In measuring the fair value, we utilize valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach, or cost approach.\nThe valuation of the identifiable assets and liabilities includes assumptions made in performing the valuation, such as projected revenue, weighted average cost of capital, discount rates, estimated useful lives, estimated probabilities of achieving contingent payment milestones, and other relevant assessments. These assessments can be significantly affected by our estimates, judgments, and assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates, judgments, or assumptions, or if additional or new information arises in the future that affects our fair value estimates, then adjustments to our initial fair value estimates may have a material impact to our purchase accounting or our results of operations.\nResults of Operations\nAs a result of our recent acquisitions, we are presenting a new revenue line for revenue derived from the IoT market. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period revenue presentation to conform to the current period revenue presentation. The following sets forth certain of our consolidated statements of income data for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, along with comparative information regarding the absolute and percentage changes in these amounts (in millions, except percentages):\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td>

report).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017\nNet Revenue.\nNet revenue was $1,630.3 million for fiscal 2018 compared with $1,718.2 million for fiscal 2017, a decrease of $87.9 million, or 5.1%. Of our fiscal 2018 net revenue, $1,021.0 million, or 62.6%, of net revenue was from the mobile product applications market, $257.8 million, or 15.8%, of net revenue was from the PC product applications market, and $351.5, or 21.6%, of net revenue was from the IoT product applications market. The overall decrease in net revenue for fiscal 2018 was attributable to a $385.0 million, or 27.4%, decrease in net revenue from mobile product applications; partially offset by an increase of $268.5 million, or 323.5% increase, in net revenue from IoT product applications, and an increase of $28.6 million, or 12.5%, in net revenue from PC product applications. The decrease in mobile product applications was driven by a decrease in the units sold (34.4% less units), partially offset by an increase in average selling prices (which increased 10.6%). The increase in net revenue from IoT product applications was primarily driven by the Conexant Acquisition and the Marvell Business Acquisition. The increase in net revenue from PC product applications was driven by an increase in the units sold (3.8% more units), partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices (which decreased 19.0%).\nGross Margin.\nGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 29.4%, or $480.1 million, for fiscal 2018 compared with 30.5%, or $523.6 million, for fiscal 2017. The 110 basis point decline in gross margin was primarily due to $38.6 million of inventory fair value adjustments associated with the Conexant Acquisition and the Marvell Business Acquisition, as well as a $23.6 million increase in acquired intangibles amortization that were charged to cost of revenue during the year, partially offset by a favorable mix due primarily to IoT business products which have higher gross margins.\nWe continuously introduce new product solutions, many of which have life cycles of less than one year. Further, because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer's application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a virtual manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue.\nOperating Expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased $70.9 million, to $363.2 million, for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. The increase in research and development expenses primarily reflected (i) a $53.8 million increase in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from a 31.2% increase in research and development headcount due to our recent acquisitions; (ii) a $10.4 million increase in software licensing and intellectual property costs; (iii) an $8.3 million increase in infrastructure costs related to facilities; (iv) a $2.9 million increase in non-employee services; (v) a $2.5 million increase in travel related costs; (vi) partially offset by a $7.6 million decrease in supplies and project related costs.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $16.4 million, to $154.0 million, for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected (i) a $17.8 million increase in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from a 2.4% increase in selling, general, and administrative headcount which included an increase in headcount due to our recent acquisitions; and (ii) a $2.5 million increase in non-employee services; (iii) partially offset by a $5.3 million reduction in infrastructure costs related to facilities.\nAcquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through recent acquisitions. See Note 5 Acquired Intangibles to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nImpairment of Acquired Intangibles. Impairment of acquired intangibles represents the reduction of the carrying value of intangible assets which have been determined unrecoverable.\nRestructuring costs. Restructuring costs primarily reflect employee severance costs and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of operations to reduce operating costs. These headcount-related costs included personnel in operations, research and development, and selling, general and administrative functions. Restructuring costs incurred in\nfiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were $12.0 million and $7.3 million, respectively, due to restructuring plans implemented in fiscal 2018 and 2016. The fiscal 2016 restructuring activities were completed in fiscal 2017 and the fiscal 2018 restructuring activities were completed in fiscal 2018. See Note 13 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nLitigation settlement charge. We accrued a litigation settlement charge during fiscal 2017 in connection with certain legal proceedings disclosed under Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nNon-Operating Income.\nInterest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net was $2.3 million for fiscal 2018 compared with $2.6 million for fiscal 2017.\nInterest expense. Interest expense in fiscal 2018 was $22.2 million and represents interest and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on the $525.0 million convertible debt issued on June 26, 2017. Interest expense in fiscal 2017 was $6.0 million and represents interest on the $250.0 million in term loan and line-of-credit debt which was paid off in conjunction with the issuance of the convertible debt in fiscal 2018. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nProvision for Income Taxes.\nAs a result of the decrease in the U.S. tax rate from the comprehensive tax legislation enacted in December 2017 by the United States government, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our U.S. statutory tax rate is lower than tax rates in many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. This resulted in a significant increase on our effective tax rate relating to foreign tax rate differential for 2018. In addition, the effective tax for fiscal year 2018 was increased by the one-time transition tax. The foreign tax differential has had a significant downward impact on the reconciliation of our provision of the U.S. Federal statutory rate to the actual provision for taxes for each fiscal year in the two-year period ended with fiscal 2017. See Note 11 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for the table reconciling the provision for income taxes from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2018 and 2017.\nIt is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $1.9 million to an increase of $3.2 million.\nIn July 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner that found that the Treasury regulations addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation in a cost-sharing arrangement with a related party were invalid. In August 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew its July 2018 opinion to allow time for the reconstituted panel to confer on this appeal. As our tax filing position is consistent with the treasury regulations, we determined no adjustment to our financial statements is required, however, due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution, we will continue to monitor developments in this case.\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016\nNet Revenue.\nNet revenue was $1,718.2 million for fiscal 2017 compared with $1,666.9 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $51.3 million, or 3.1%. Of our fiscal 2017 net revenue, $1,406.0 million, or 81.9%, of net revenue was from the mobile product applications market, $229.2 million, or 13.3%, of net revenue was from the PC product applications market, and $83.0 million, or 4.8%, was from the IoT product applications market. The overall increase in net revenue for fiscal 2017 was attributable to an increase of $21.8 million, or 10.5%, in net revenue from PC product applications, a $21.7 million, or 35.4% increase in net revenue from IoT product applications, and a $7.8 million, or 0.6% increase in net revenue from mobile product applications, despite a 16.5% decline in revenue from our discrete display products which are incorporated into smartphones. The increase in net revenue from PC product applications was driven by an increase in the units sold (7.0% more units) as well as an increase in average selling prices (which increased 3.3%). The increase in IoT product applications was driven by an increase in the units sold (45.7% more units), partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices (which decreased 7.1%). The increase in mobile product applications was driven by an increase in the units sold (11.4% more units), partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices (which decreased 10.2%).\nGross Margin.\nGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 30.5%, or $523.6 million, for fiscal 2017 compared with 34.9%, or $581.5 million, for fiscal 2016. The 440 basis point decline in gross margin was primarily due to product mix, including the impact of lower margins on TDDI products and technical issues associated with new optical fingerprint solutions. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was negatively impacted by the lower margins on TDDI products and fingerprint products.\nWe continuously introduce new product solutions, many of which have life cycles of less than one year. Further, because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer's application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a virtual manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue.\nOperating Expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $18.9 million, to $292.3 million, for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected (i) an $11.1 million decrease in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from a 3% decrease in research and development headcount which included a reduction in headcount due to a restructuring of operations to reduce operating costs, (ii) a $6.3 million decrease in non-employee services, (iii) a $5.4 million decrease in infrastructure costs related to facilities, partially offset by a $6.2 million increase in supplies and project related costs.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $24.1 million, to $137.6 million, for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected (i) an $11.6 million decrease in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from an 8% decrease in selling, general, and administrative headcount which included a reduction in headcount due to a restructuring of operations to reduce operating costs, (ii) a $7.0 million decrease in legal expenses, (iii) a $5.1 million reduction in foreign currency losses, partially offset by a $2.9 million increase in facilities related costs, and (iv) a $2.7 million accrual for payroll deposit penalties related to the timing of tax deposits for stock-based compensation.\nAcquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through recent acquisitions. See Note 5 Acquired Intangibles to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nImpairment of Acquired Intangibles. Impairment of acquired intangibles represents the reduction of the carrying value of intangible assets which have been determined unrecoverable.\nRestructuring costs. Restructuring costs primarily reflect employee severance costs and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of operations to reduce operating costs. These headcount-related costs included personnel in operations, research and development, and selling, general and administrative functions. Restructuring costs incurred in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively, were $7.3 million and $8.6 million due to restructuring plans implemented in fiscal 2016. The fiscal 2016 restructuring activities were completed in fiscal 2017. See Note 13 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nLitigation settlement charge. We accrued a litigation settlement charge during fiscal 2017 in connection with certain legal proceedings disclosed under Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nNon-Operating Income.\nInterest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net was $2.6 million for fiscal 2017 compared with $5.2 million for fiscal 2016, resulting from an impairment recovery on investments upon redemption and a gain on legal settlement.\nInterest expense. Interest expense represents interest on the $250.0 million in debt borrowed under a term loan and line-of-credit which were paid off in fiscal 2018. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nProvision for Income Taxes.\nOur effective tax rate is largely attributable to the tax rates in the foreign jurisdictions in which our pre-tax profit is recognized for income tax purposes. The foreign tax differential has had a significant downward impact on the reconciliation of our provision at the U.S. Federal statutory rate to the actual provision for taxes for each fiscal year in the three year period ended with fiscal 2017. While the impact of tax in foreign jurisdictions does have the most significant impact on our effective tax rate, the lower tax rate in fiscal 2016 was also driven by the permanent extension of the federal research tax credit and our ongoing tax planning. See Note 11 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for the table reconciling the provision for income taxes from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2017 and 2016.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters in the two-year period ended June 30, 2018. The following table should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report. We have prepared this unaudited information on the same basis as our audited financial statements. This table includes all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations for the quarters presented. Past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future operating performance; accordingly, you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the results of operations for any quarter presented.\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions, except per share amounts)\n(unaudited)\n</td>

fiscal 2017, a decrease of $66.8 million. This decrease primarily reflected cash flows used in investing and financing activities, primarily related to $396.7 million of cash used for the acquisition of businesses, $220.0 used for the payment of debt, $93.6 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, $34.1 million used for the purchase of property and equipment, $7.7 million used for the purchase of intangible assets, partially offset by $514.5 net proceeds from issuance of convertible debt, $32.3 million proceeds from issuance of shares, and cash flows provided by operating activities of $145.0 million. We consider earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested overseas and have made no provision for income or withholding taxes, other than the one-time transition tax, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of June 30, 2018, $153.2 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities. For fiscal 2018, the $145.0 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net loss of $124.1 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including acquired intangibles amortization of $83.9 million, share-based compensation costs of $71.3 million, and depreciation and amortization of $38.9 million, as well as other non-cash adjustments of $25.2 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $49.8 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $79.5 million decrease in inventories, an $18.8 million decrease in prepaid expenses, a $6.2 million increase in accounts payable, a $5.4 million increase in income taxes payable, partially offset by a $22.7 million increase in accounts receivable, a $22.1 million decrease in other accrued liabilities, an $8.1 million decrease in accrued compensation, and a $7.2 million increase in other assets. Our days sales outstanding increased from 54 days to 67 days from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018, due to a much smaller percentage of the quarter's net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2017 quarter compared with a much larger percentage of the quarter's net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2018 quarter. We do believe DSOs are at normalized levels which are typically between 60 to 70 days. Our inventory turns decreased to seven in fiscal 2018 from nine in 2017.\nFor fiscal 2017, the $152.9 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of $48.8 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including share-based compensation costs of $61.8 million, acquired intangibles amortization of $59.3 million, and depreciation and amortization of $33.2 million, partially offset by other non-cash adjustments of $18.3 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $31.9 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $38.4 million decrease of accounts payable, a $16.8 million decrease in acquisition related liabilities, a $9.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and a $7.8 million decrease in accrued compensation, partially offset by a $19.5 million increase in other accrued liabilities, a $15.0 million decrease in inventories, and a $6.5 million decrease in other assets. Our days sales outstanding decreased from 70 days to 54 days from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017, due to a much smaller percentage of the quarter's net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2017 quarter compared with a much larger percentage of the quarter's net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2016 quarter. Despite the decrease in DSOs from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2017, the Company's accounts receivable, net increased from $252.6 million to $255.2 million over the same period. The 1.0% increase in accounts receivable, net is due to a significant 31.7% increase in net revenue from the three months ended June 30, 2017 to the three months ended June 30, 2016, partially offset by the fact the net revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2017 occurred more evenly through the quarter as compared to a larger percentage occurring later in the quarter in the three months ended June 30, 2016. Our inventory turns increased to nine in fiscal 2017 from six in 2016.\nFor fiscal 2016, the $256.6 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of $72.2 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including acquired intangibles amortization of $73.0 million, share-based compensation costs of $56.8 million, and depreciation and amortization of $31.2 million, partially offset by other non-cash adjustments of $6.1 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $30.0 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $72.0 million decrease in accounts receivable and a $9.1 million increase in other accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $26.1 million decrease in income taxes payable, an $18.2 million decrease in acquisition related liabilities, and a $15.3 million decrease in accounts payable. Our days sales outstanding increased from 61 days to 70 days from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016. Our inventory turns decreased to six in fiscal 2016 from eight in 2015.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $438.5 million, $42.3 million, and $26.6 million, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018 consisted of $396.7 million used for the acquisition of businesses, $34.1 million used for the purchase of capital assets and $7.7 million used to purchase intangible assets. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 consisted of $31.4 million used for the purchase of capital assets and $18.4 million for an equity method investment, partially offset by $7.5 million in proceeds from sales of investments. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2016 consisted of $28.6 million used for the purchase of capital assets and $4.6 million for the purchase of intangible assets, partially offset by $6.6 million in proceeds from sales of investments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash provided in financing activities for fiscal 2018 was $226.7 million and net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was $94.1 million and $281.1 million, respectively. Our net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to $514.5 million of proceeds received for issuance of convertible debt, net, $32.3 million of proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $220.0 million used for the payment of debt, $93.6 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market, and $5.4 million used for payroll taxes for DSUs. Our net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to $88.0 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market, $18.8 million used for the payment of debt, $6.6 million used for payroll taxes for DSUs and MSUs, and $5.3 million used for the payment of acquisition related liabilities, partially offset by $24.7 million of proceeds from issuance of shares. Our net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to $240.6 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market, $60.9 million used for the payment of acquisition related liabilities, $15.6 million used for payroll taxes for DSUs and MSUs, and $7.6 million used for the payment of debt, partially offset by $32.4 million of proceeds from issuance of shares and $11.5 million of excess tax benefit from share-based compensation.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program. As of June 30, 2018, our Board of Directors has cumulatively authorized $1.3 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2019. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases is based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through the end of fiscal 2018, we purchased 27,639,876 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.1 billion. Treasury shares purchased prior to August 28, 2008 were not subject to the stock split on that date; if adjusted for the stock split, the average cost would be $33.37. As of June 30, 2018, we had $226.1 million remaining under our common stock repurchase program.\nConvertible Debt. On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the initial purchasers named therein, or collectively, the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and the Initial Purchasers agreed to purchase, $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds, after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discounts, were $514.5 million, which includes proceeds from the Initial Purchasers' exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes. We received the net proceeds on June 26, 2017, which we used to repurchase shares of our common stock, to retire our outstanding bank debt, and to provide additional cash resources to fund the Conexant and Marvell Business Acquisitions.\nThe Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year. Interest accrued from June 26, 2017 and is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries.\nThe Notes mature on June 15, 2022, or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted.\nHolders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances.\nOn or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock.\nThe conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nWe may not redeem the Notes prior to June 20, 2020. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after June 20, 2020, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption.\nBank Credit Facility.\nAt the end of fiscal 2017, we had $220.0 million principal outstanding under our Credit Agreement consisting of $100.0 million under our revolving credit facility and $120.0 million under our term loan arrangement. At the beginning of fiscal 2018, we issued $525.0 million principal amount of convertible notes and utilized a portion of the proceeds from our Notes to retire the outstanding principal and interest balances on our revolving credit facility and our term loan arrangement. At the end of July 2017, we made an election to reduce the commitment under the revolving credit facility from $450.0 million to $250.0 million as we were able to complete the Conexant Acquisition with available cash.\nIn September 2017, we entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement, or the Agreement, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders. The Agreement terminated our term loan arrangement and provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $200 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2018, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. As a result of terminating our term loan arrangement, we expensed the remaining debt issuance costs attributable to the term loan of $1.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nThe revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022, and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date. Debt issuance costs of $2.3 million will be amortized over 60 months.\nOur obligations under the Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties' direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. As of June 30, 2018, there is no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility.\nUnder the Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not\nexceed 3.50 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 3.75 to 1.00, and thereafter, shall not be more than 3.50 to 1.00. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 3.00 to 1.00.\n$100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance under Rule 145 of the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the acquired company, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, available credit under the Credit Agreement and net proceeds from our Notes will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months, including the Conexant Acquisition, the Marvell Business Acquisition, our contingent consideration obligations associated with the acquisition of Validity, and our debt service obligations. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, the costs of maintaining sufficient space for our expanding workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of the end of fiscal 2018 (in millions):\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 535.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 527.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations and other commitments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 612.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 528.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Represents the principal and interest payable through the maturity date of the underlying contractual obligation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Purchase obligations and other commitments include payments due for inventory purchase obligations with contract manufacturers, long-term software tool licenses, and other licenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> Represents payments retained in connection with the earn-out consideration related to the Validity acquisition.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with the acquisition of Validity in November 2013, we entered into a contingent consideration arrangement. As of June 30, 2018, the balance represents amounts we have not paid and have retained, subject to the resolution of matters related to the Amkor Technology legal dispute (see Legal Proceedings under Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report). The earn-out period for this arrangement was complete as of March 31, 2016. We estimated the fair value of the final earn-out consideration liability as of June 30, 2018 to be $8.7 million.\nThe amounts in the table above exclude unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $24.8 million. As of June 30, 2018, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit.\nThe amounts in the table above exclude the provisional amount for our one-time transition tax liability for our foreign subsidiaries of $44.1 million. As of June 30, 2018, the amount recorded is a provisional amount and may change as we prepare our fiscal 2018 tax return.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. We have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support; engage in leasing, hedging, or research and development services; or have other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected in our financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standard update, or ASU, on Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The ASU will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when the new standard becomes effective and requires entities to recognize revenue when they transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU is effective for us in our fiscal year 2019, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We did not early adopt the new standard. The new standard permits the use of either the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method and we plan to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective transition method. Based on our assessment of the ASU and our related customer contracts and current revenue recognition methodologies and processes, the new revenue standard is not expected to have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in our consolidated financial statements. The new guidance will also require additional disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU on Leases. This update requires organizations that lease assets with lease terms of more than 12 months to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases on their balance sheets. It also requires new qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effects of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nForward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those set forth elsewhere in this report and under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOverview\nWe are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed human interface semiconductor product solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing, communications, entertainment, and other electronic devices. We believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus and the strength of our intellectual property and our engineering know-how, which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of our OEMs.\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, and title has transferred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Our net revenue increased from $947.5 million for fiscal 2014 to $1,630.3 million for fiscal 2018, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 14.5%. For fiscal 2014, we derived 27.2% of our net revenue from the personal computer market and 72.8% of our net revenue from the mobile product applications market. For fiscal 2018, revenue from the personal computer market accounted for 15.8% of our net revenue, revenue from the mobile product applications market accounted for 62.6% of our net revenue, and revenue from the IoT product applications market accounted for 21.6% of our net revenue.\nMany of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in Armenia, China, Denmark, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States, we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis.\nOur manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers' facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next 90 days. However, we do not have any long-term supply contracts with any of our contract manufacturers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials, logistics, amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology, backlog, and supplier arrangements, manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers, and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value to cost of revenue.\nOur gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers' products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin.\nOur research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human interface solutions for OEM customers prior to and after their commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives' commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities.\nAcquired intangibles amortization is the amortization of the cost of our acquired intangible assets related to customer relationships and tradenames which are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 7 years.\nImpairment of acquired intangibles represents the reduction of the carrying value of intangibles which have been determined unrecoverable.\nRestructuring costs primarily reflect severance and facilities consolidation costs related to restructuring of our operations to reduce operating costs. These headcount- and facilities-related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative. See Note 13 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nThe litigation settlement charge reflects costs recorded in connection with certain legal proceedings further discussed under Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nEquity investment loss includes amortization of intangible assets reflected under the equity method of accounting in connection with our investment in OXi Technology Ltd. (see Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report).\nAcquisitions and Financing Activities\nOn June 11, 2017, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Conexant Systems, LLC, (the Conexant Acquisition\u201d). The Conexant Acquisition is intended to increase our presence in the smart home market and increase opportunities to grow revenue. Effective July 25, 2017, or the Closing Date, we completed the Conexant Acquisition. The results of Conexant are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period from July 25, 2017 through June 30, 2018. For further discussion of the Conexant Acquisition, see Note 4 included in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nOn June 11, 2017, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the multimedia solutions business of Marvell (the Marvell Business Acquisition\u201d). The Marvell Business Acquisition is also intended to increase our presence in the smart home market and increase opportunities to grow revenue. Effective September 8, 2017, we completed the Marvell Business Acquisition. The results of Marvell are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period from September 8, 2017 through June 30, 2018. For further discussion of the Marvell Business Acquisition, see Note 4 included in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nOn June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the several initial purchasers named therein (collectively, the Initial Purchasers\u201d), pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and the Initial Purchasers agreed to purchase, $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the Notes\u201d) in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds from the Offering, after deducting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $514.5 million, which includes proceeds from the exercise of the Initial Purchasers' option to purchase additional Notes. The Offering was completed on June 26, 2017. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, product warranty, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, tax contingencies, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe methods, estimates, interpretations, and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC considers an entity's most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of the entity's financial condition and results of operations and those that require the entity's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, and title has transferred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. We accrue for estimated sales returns, incentives, and other allowances at the time we recognize revenue. Our products contain embedded firmware and software, which together with, or consisting of, our ASIC chip, deliver the essential functionality of our products and, as such, software revenue recognition guidance is not applicable. The majority of our sales to distributors are made under agreements that generally do not provide for price adjustments after purchase and provide for only limited return rights under product warranty. Revenue on these sales is recognized in the same manner as sales to our non-distributor customers. Some of our sales are to distributors which have limited stock rotation rights, which allow them to rotate a small portion of product in their inventory a maximum of two times per year. We recognize revenue to these distributors upon shipment of product to the distributor, as the stock rotation rights are limited and we can reasonably estimate expected product returns when right of return exists. When sales rebates, price allowances and stock rotations are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized.\nInventory\nWe state our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We base our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories on our projections of future demand and market conditions. Sudden declines in demand, rapid product improvements, or technological changes, or any combination of these factors can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories. On an ongoing basis, we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their net realizable value based on our forecasts of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts, additional inventory write-downs may be required. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected decline in demand, rapid product improvements and technological advances, and termination or changes by our OEM customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions.\nPeriodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In those circumstances, we record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe have applied significant estimates and judgments in order to determine the fair value of the identified assets acquired, liabilities assumed, goodwill recognized, and contingent consideration recorded in connection with our business combinations to ensure the value of the assets and liabilities acquired are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. In measuring the fair value, we utilize valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach, or cost approach.\nThe valuation of the identifiable assets and liabilities includes assumptions made in performing the valuation, such as projected revenue, weighted average cost of capital, discount rates, estimated useful lives, estimated probabilities of achieving contingent payment milestones, and other relevant assessments. These assessments can be significantly affected by our estimates, judgments, and assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates, judgments, or assumptions, or if additional or new information arises in the future that affects our fair value estimates, then adjustments to our initial fair value estimates may have a material impact to our purchase accounting or our results of operations.\nResults of Operations\nAs a result of our recent acquisitions, we are presenting a new revenue line for revenue derived from the IoT market. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period revenue presentation to conform to the current period revenue presentation. The following sets forth certain of our consolidated statements of income data for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, along with comparative information regarding the absolute and percentage changes in these amounts (in millions, except percentages):\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td>

post-acquisition results of operations from Conexant, acquired on July 25, 2017, and the multimedia solutions business of Marvell, acquired on September 8, 2017 (see Note 4 Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report). \nFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017\nNet Revenue.\nNet revenue was $1,630.3 million for fiscal 2018 compared with $1,718.2 million for fiscal 2017, a decrease of $87.9 million, or 5.1%. Of our fiscal 2018 net revenue, $1,021.0 million, or 62.6%, of net revenue was from the mobile product applications market, $257.8 million, or 15.8%, of net revenue was from the PC product applications market, and $351.5, or 21.6%, of net revenue was from the IoT product applications market. The overall decrease in net revenue for fiscal 2018 was attributable to a $385.0 million, or 27.4%, decrease in net revenue from mobile product applications; partially offset by an increase of $268.5 million, or 323.5% increase, in net revenue from IoT product applications, and an increase of $28.6 million, or 12.5%, in net revenue from PC product applications. The decrease in mobile product applications was driven by a decrease in the units sold (34.4% less units), partially offset by an increase in average selling prices (which increased 10.6%). The increase in net revenue from IoT product applications was primarily driven by the Conexant Acquisition and the Marvell Business Acquisition. The increase in net revenue from PC product applications was driven by an increase in the units sold (3.8% more units), partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices (which decreased 19.0%).\nGross Margin.\nGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 29.4%, or $480.1 million, for fiscal 2018 compared with 30.5%, or $523.6 million, for fiscal 2017. The 110 basis point decline in gross margin was primarily due to $38.6 million of inventory fair value adjustments associated with the Conexant Acquisition and the Marvell Business Acquisition, as well as a $23.6 million increase in acquired intangibles amortization that were charged to cost of revenue during the year, partially offset by a favorable mix due primarily to IoT business products which have higher gross margins.\nWe continuously introduce new product solutions, many of which have life cycles of less than one year. Further, because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer's application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a virtual manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue.\nOperating Expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased $70.9 million, to $363.2 million, for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. The increase in research and development expenses primarily reflected (i) a $53.8 million increase in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from a 31.2% increase in research and development headcount due to our recent acquisitions; (ii) a $10.4 million increase in software licensing and intellectual property costs; (iii) an $8.3 million increase in infrastructure costs related to facilities; (iv) a $2.9 million increase in non-employee services; (v) a $2.5 million increase in travel related costs; (vi) partially offset by a $7.6 million decrease in supplies and project related costs.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $16.4 million, to $154.0 million, for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected (i) a $17.8 million increase in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from a 2.4% increase in selling, general, and administrative headcount which included an increase in headcount due to our recent acquisitions; and (ii) a $2.5 million increase in non-employee services; (iii) partially offset by a $5.3 million reduction in infrastructure costs related to facilities.\nAcquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through recent acquisitions. See Note 5 Acquired Intangibles to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nImpairment of Acquired Intangibles. Impairment of acquired intangibles represents the reduction of the carrying value of intangible assets which have been determined unrecoverable.\nRestructuring costs. Restructuring costs primarily reflect employee severance costs and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of operations to reduce operating costs. These headcount-related costs included personnel in operations, research and development, and selling, general and administrative functions. Restructuring costs incurred in\nfiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were $12.0 million and $7.3 million, respectively, due to restructuring plans implemented in fiscal 2018 and 2016. The fiscal 2016 restructuring activities were completed in fiscal 2017 and the fiscal 2018 restructuring activities were completed in fiscal 2018. See Note 13 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nLitigation settlement charge. We accrued a litigation settlement charge during fiscal 2017 in connection with certain legal proceedings disclosed under Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nNon-Operating Income.\nInterest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net was $2.3 million for fiscal 2018 compared with $2.6 million for fiscal 2017.\nInterest expense. Interest expense in fiscal 2018 was $22.2 million and represents interest and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on the $525.0 million convertible debt issued on June 26, 2017. Interest expense in fiscal 2017 was $6.0 million and represents interest on the $250.0 million in term loan and line-of-credit debt which was paid off in conjunction with the issuance of the convertible debt in fiscal 2018. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nProvision for Income Taxes.\nAs a result of the decrease in the U.S. tax rate from the comprehensive tax legislation enacted in December 2017 by the United States government, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our U.S. statutory tax rate is lower than tax rates in many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. This resulted in a significant increase on our effective tax rate relating to foreign tax rate differential for 2018. In addition, the effective tax for fiscal year 2018 was increased by the one-time transition tax. The foreign tax differential has had a significant downward impact on the reconciliation of our provision of the U.S. Federal statutory rate to the actual provision for taxes for each fiscal year in the two-year period ended with fiscal 2017. See Note 11 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for the table reconciling the provision for income taxes from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2018 and 2017.\nIt is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $1.9 million to an increase of $3.2 million.\nIn July 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner that found that the Treasury regulations addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation in a cost-sharing arrangement with a related party were invalid. In August 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew its July 2018 opinion to allow time for the reconstituted panel to confer on this appeal. As our tax filing position is consistent with the treasury regulations, we determined no adjustment to our financial statements is required, however, due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution, we will continue to monitor developments in this case.\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016\nNet Revenue.\nNet revenue was $1,718.2 million for fiscal 2017 compared with $1,666.9 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $51.3 million, or 3.1%. Of our fiscal 2017 net revenue, $1,406.0 million, or 81.9%, of net revenue was from the mobile product applications market, $229.2 million, or 13.3%, of net revenue was from the PC product applications market, and $83.0 million, or 4.8%, was from the IoT product applications market. The overall increase in net revenue for fiscal 2017 was attributable to an increase of $21.8 million, or 10.5%, in net revenue from PC product applications, a $21.7 million, or 35.4% increase in net revenue from IoT product applications, and a $7.8 million, or 0.6% increase in net revenue from mobile product applications, despite a 16.5% decline in revenue from our discrete display products which are incorporated into smartphones. The increase in net revenue from PC product applications was driven by an increase in the units sold (7.0% more units) as well as an increase in average selling prices (which increased 3.3%). The increase in IoT product applications was driven by an increase in the units sold (45.7% more units), partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices (which decreased 7.1%). The increase in mobile product applications was driven by an increase in the units sold (11.4% more units), partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices (which decreased 10.2%).\nGross Margin.\nGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 30.5%, or $523.6 million, for fiscal 2017 compared with 34.9%, or $581.5 million, for fiscal 2016. The 440 basis point decline in gross margin was primarily due to product mix, including the impact of lower margins on TDDI products and technical issues associated with new optical fingerprint solutions. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was negatively impacted by the lower margins on TDDI products and fingerprint products.\nWe continuously introduce new product solutions, many of which have life cycles of less than one year. Further, because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer's application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a virtual manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue.\nOperating Expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $18.9 million, to $292.3 million, for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected (i) an $11.1 million decrease in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from a 3% decrease in research and development headcount which included a reduction in headcount due to a restructuring of operations to reduce operating costs, (ii) a $6.3 million decrease in non-employee services, (iii) a $5.4 million decrease in infrastructure costs related to facilities, partially offset by a $6.2 million increase in supplies and project related costs.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $24.1 million, to $137.6 million, for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected (i) an $11.6 million decrease in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from an 8% decrease in selling, general, and administrative headcount which included a reduction in headcount due to a restructuring of operations to reduce operating costs, (ii) a $7.0 million decrease in legal expenses, (iii) a $5.1 million reduction in foreign currency losses, partially offset by a $2.9 million increase in facilities related costs, and (iv) a $2.7 million accrual for payroll deposit penalties related to the timing of tax deposits for stock-based compensation.\nAcquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through recent acquisitions. See Note 5 Acquired Intangibles to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nImpairment of Acquired Intangibles. Impairment of acquired intangibles represents the reduction of the carrying value of intangible assets which have been determined unrecoverable.\nRestructuring costs. Restructuring costs primarily reflect employee severance costs and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of operations to reduce operating costs. These headcount-related costs included personnel in operations, research and development, and selling, general and administrative functions. Restructuring costs incurred in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively, were $7.3 million and $8.6 million due to restructuring plans implemented in fiscal 2016. The fiscal 2016 restructuring activities were completed in fiscal 2017. See Note 13 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nLitigation settlement charge. We accrued a litigation settlement charge during fiscal 2017 in connection with certain legal proceedings disclosed under Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nNon-Operating Income.\nInterest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net was $2.6 million for fiscal 2017 compared with $5.2 million for fiscal 2016, resulting from an impairment recovery on investments upon redemption and a gain on legal settlement.\nInterest expense. Interest expense represents interest on the $250.0 million in debt borrowed under a term loan and line-of-credit which were paid off in fiscal 2018. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nProvision for Income Taxes.\nOur effective tax rate is largely attributable to the tax rates in the foreign jurisdictions in which our pre-tax profit is recognized for income tax purposes. The foreign tax differential has had a significant downward impact on the reconciliation of our provision at the U.S. Federal statutory rate to the actual provision for taxes for each fiscal year in the three year period ended with fiscal 2017. While the impact of tax in foreign jurisdictions does have the most significant impact on our effective tax rate, the lower tax rate in fiscal 2016 was also driven by the permanent extension of the federal research tax credit and our ongoing tax planning. See Note 11 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for the table reconciling the provision for income taxes from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2017 and 2016.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters in the two-year period ended June 30, 2018. The following table should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report. We have prepared this unaudited information on the same basis as our audited financial statements. This table includes all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations for the quarters presented. Past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future operating performance; accordingly, you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the results of operations for any quarter presented.\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions, except per share amounts)\n(unaudited)\n</td>

fiscal 2017, a decrease of $66.8 million. This decrease primarily reflected cash flows used in investing and financing activities, primarily related to $396.7 million of cash used for the acquisition of businesses, $220.0 used for the payment of debt, $93.6 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, $34.1 million used for the purchase of property and equipment, $7.7 million used for the purchase of intangible assets, partially offset by $514.5 net proceeds from issuance of convertible debt, $32.3 million proceeds from issuance of shares, and cash flows provided by operating activities of $145.0 million. We consider earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested overseas and have made no provision for income or withholding taxes, other than the one-time transition tax, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of June 30, 2018, $153.2 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities. For fiscal 2018, the $145.0 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net loss of $124.1 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including acquired intangibles amortization of $83.9 million, share-based compensation costs of $71.3 million, and depreciation and amortization of $38.9 million, as well as other non-cash adjustments of $25.2 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $49.8 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $79.5 million decrease in inventories, an $18.8 million decrease in prepaid expenses, a $6.2 million increase in accounts payable, a $5.4 million increase in income taxes payable, partially offset by a $22.7 million increase in accounts receivable, a $22.1 million decrease in other accrued liabilities, an $8.1 million decrease in accrued compensation, and a $7.2 million increase in other assets. Our days sales outstanding increased from 54 days to 67 days from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018, due to a much smaller percentage of the quarter's net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2017 quarter compared with a much larger percentage of the quarter's net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2018 quarter. We do believe DSOs are at normalized levels which are typically between 60 to 70 days. Our inventory turns decreased to seven in fiscal 2018 from nine in 2017.\nFor fiscal 2017, the $152.9 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of $48.8 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including share-based compensation costs of $61.8 million, acquired intangibles amortization of $59.3 million, and depreciation and amortization of $33.2 million, partially offset by other non-cash adjustments of $18.3 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $31.9 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $38.4 million decrease of accounts payable, a $16.8 million decrease in acquisition related liabilities, a $9.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and a $7.8 million decrease in accrued compensation, partially offset by a $19.5 million increase in other accrued liabilities, a $15.0 million decrease in inventories, and a $6.5 million decrease in other assets. Our days sales outstanding decreased from 70 days to 54 days from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017, due to a much smaller percentage of the quarter's net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2017 quarter compared with a much larger percentage of the quarter's net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2016 quarter. Despite the decrease in DSOs from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2017, the Company's accounts receivable, net increased from $252.6 million to $255.2 million over the same period. The 1.0% increase in accounts receivable, net is due to a significant 31.7% increase in net revenue from the three months ended June 30, 2017 to the three months ended June 30, 2016, partially offset by the fact the net revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2017 occurred more evenly through the quarter as compared to a larger percentage occurring later in the quarter in the three months ended June 30, 2016. Our inventory turns increased to nine in fiscal 2017 from six in 2016.\nFor fiscal 2016, the $256.6 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of $72.2 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including acquired intangibles amortization of $73.0 million, share-based compensation costs of $56.8 million, and depreciation and amortization of $31.2 million, partially offset by other non-cash adjustments of $6.1 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $30.0 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $72.0 million decrease in accounts receivable and a $9.1 million increase in other accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $26.1 million decrease in income taxes payable, an $18.2 million decrease in acquisition related liabilities, and a $15.3 million decrease in accounts payable. Our days sales outstanding increased from 61 days to 70 days from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016. Our inventory turns decreased to six in fiscal 2016 from eight in 2015.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $438.5 million, $42.3 million, and $26.6 million, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018 consisted of $396.7 million used for the acquisition of businesses, $34.1 million used for the purchase of capital assets and $7.7 million used to purchase intangible assets. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 consisted of $31.4 million used for the purchase of capital assets and $18.4 million for an equity method investment, partially offset by $7.5 million in proceeds from sales of investments. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2016 consisted of $28.6 million used for the purchase of capital assets and $4.6 million for the purchase of intangible assets, partially offset by $6.6 million in proceeds from sales of investments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash provided in financing activities for fiscal 2018 was $226.7 million and net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was $94.1 million and $281.1 million, respectively. Our net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to $514.5 million of proceeds received for issuance of convertible debt, net, $32.3 million of proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $220.0 million used for the payment of debt, $93.6 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market, and $5.4 million used for payroll taxes for DSUs. Our net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to $88.0 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market, $18.8 million used for the payment of debt, $6.6 million used for payroll taxes for DSUs and MSUs, and $5.3 million used for the payment of acquisition related liabilities, partially offset by $24.7 million of proceeds from issuance of shares. Our net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to $240.6 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market, $60.9 million used for the payment of acquisition related liabilities, $15.6 million used for payroll taxes for DSUs and MSUs, and $7.6 million used for the payment of debt, partially offset by $32.4 million of proceeds from issuance of shares and $11.5 million of excess tax benefit from share-based compensation.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program. As of June 30, 2018, our Board of Directors has cumulatively authorized $1.3 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2019. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases is based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through the end of fiscal 2018, we purchased 27,639,876 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.1 billion. Treasury shares purchased prior to August 28, 2008 were not subject to the stock split on that date; if adjusted for the stock split, the average cost would be $33.37. As of June 30, 2018, we had $226.1 million remaining under our common stock repurchase program.\nConvertible Debt. On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the initial purchasers named therein, or collectively, the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and the Initial Purchasers agreed to purchase, $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds, after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discounts, were $514.5 million, which includes proceeds from the Initial Purchasers' exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes. We received the net proceeds on June 26, 2017, which we used to repurchase shares of our common stock, to retire our outstanding bank debt, and to provide additional cash resources to fund the Conexant and Marvell Business Acquisitions.\nThe Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year. Interest accrued from June 26, 2017 and is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries.\nThe Notes mature on June 15, 2022, or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted.\nHolders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances.\nOn or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock.\nThe conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nWe may not redeem the Notes prior to June 20, 2020. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after June 20, 2020, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption.\nBank Credit Facility.\nAt the end of fiscal 2017, we had $220.0 million principal outstanding under our Credit Agreement consisting of $100.0 million under our revolving credit facility and $120.0 million under our term loan arrangement. At the beginning of fiscal 2018, we issued $525.0 million principal amount of convertible notes and utilized a portion of the proceeds from our Notes to retire the outstanding principal and interest balances on our revolving credit facility and our term loan arrangement. At the end of July 2017, we made an election to reduce the commitment under the revolving credit facility from $450.0 million to $250.0 million as we were able to complete the Conexant Acquisition with available cash.\nIn September 2017, we entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement, or the Agreement, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders. The Agreement terminated our term loan arrangement and provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $200 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2018, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. As a result of terminating our term loan arrangement, we expensed the remaining debt issuance costs attributable to the term loan of $1.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nThe revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022, and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date. Debt issuance costs of $2.3 million will be amortized over 60 months.\nOur obligations under the Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties' direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. As of June 30, 2018, there is no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility.\nUnder the Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not\nexceed 3.50 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 3.75 to 1.00, and thereafter, shall not be more than 3.50 to 1.00. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 3.00 to 1.00.\n$100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance under Rule 145 of the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the acquired company, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, available credit under the Credit Agreement and net proceeds from our Notes will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months, including the Conexant Acquisition, the Marvell Business Acquisition, our contingent consideration obligations associated with the acquisition of Validity, and our debt service obligations. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, the costs of maintaining sufficient space for our expanding workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of the end of fiscal 2018 (in millions):\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 535.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 527.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations and other commitments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 612.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 528.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents the principal and interest payable through the maturity date of the underlying contractual obligation. \n (2) Purchase obligations and other commitments include payments due for inventory purchase obligations with contract manufacturers, long-term software tool licenses, and other licenses. \n (3) Represents payments retained in connection with the earn-out consideration related to the Validity acquisition. \nIn connection with the acquisition of Validity in November 2013, we entered into a contingent consideration arrangement. As of June 30, 2018, the balance represents amounts we have not paid and have retained, subject to the resolution of matters related to the Amkor Technology legal dispute (see Legal Proceedings under Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report). The earn-out period for this arrangement was complete as of March 31, 2016. We estimated the fair value of the final earn-out consideration liability as of June 30, 2018 to be $8.7 million.\nThe amounts in the table above exclude unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $24.8 million. As of June 30, 2018, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit.\nThe amounts in the table above exclude the provisional amount for our one-time transition tax liability for our foreign subsidiaries of $44.1 million. As of June 30, 2018, the amount recorded is a provisional amount and may change as we prepare our fiscal 2018 tax return.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. We have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support; engage in leasing, hedging, or research and development services; or have other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected in our financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standard update, or ASU, on Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The ASU will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when the new standard becomes effective and requires entities to recognize revenue when they transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU is effective for us in our fiscal year 2019, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We did not early adopt the new standard. The new standard permits the use of either the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method and we plan to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective transition method. Based on our assessment of the ASU and our related customer contracts and current revenue recognition methodologies and processes, the new revenue standard is not expected to have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in our consolidated financial statements. The new guidance will also require additional disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU on Leases. This update requires organizations that lease assets with lease terms of more than 12 months to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases on their balance sheets. It also requires new qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effects of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nForward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Results\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors, including those set forth elsewhere in this report and under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOverview\nWe are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom-designed human interface semiconductor product solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing, communications, entertainment, and other electronic devices. We believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus and the strength of our intellectual property and our engineering know-how, which allow us to develop or engineer products that meet the demanding design specifications of our OEMs.\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, and title has transferred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Our net revenue increased from $947.5 million for fiscal 2014 to $1,630.3 million for fiscal 2018, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 14.5%. For fiscal 2014, we derived 27.2% of our net revenue from the personal computer market and 72.8% of our net revenue from the mobile product applications market. For fiscal 2018, revenue from the personal computer market accounted for 15.8% of our net revenue, revenue from the mobile product applications market accounted for 62.6% of our net revenue, and revenue from the IoT product applications market accounted for 21.6% of our net revenue.\nMany of our customers have manufacturing operations in China, and many of our OEM customers have established design centers in Asia. With our expanding global presence, including offices in Armenia, China, Denmark, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United States, we are well positioned to provide local sales, operational, and engineering support services to our existing customers, as well as potential new customers, on a global basis.\nOur manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements and generally drop ship our products directly to our customers from our contract manufacturers' facilities, eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories. This approach requires us to work closely with our contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements. We provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next 90 days. However, we do not have any long-term supply contracts with any of our contract manufacturers. We use third-party wafer manufacturers to supply wafers and third-party packaging manufacturers to package our proprietary ASICs. In certain cases, we rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products. Our cost of revenue includes all costs associated with the production of our products, including materials, logistics, amortization of intangibles related to acquired developed technology, backlog, and supplier arrangements, manufacturing, assembly, and test costs paid to third-party manufacturers, and related overhead costs associated with our indirect manufacturing operations personnel. Additionally, we charge all warranty costs, losses on inventory purchase obligations, and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value to cost of revenue.\nOur gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our OEM customers' products by meeting their custom design requirements and the impact of our ongoing cost-improvement programs. These cost-improvement programs include reducing materials and component costs and implementing design and process improvements. Our newly introduced products may have lower margins than our more mature products, which have realized greater benefits associated with our ongoing cost-improvement programs. As a result, new product introductions may initially negatively impact our gross margin.\nOur research and development expenses include costs for supplies and materials related to product development as well as the engineering costs incurred to design ASICs and human interface solutions for OEM customers prior to and after their commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products. We continue to commit to the technological and design innovation required to maintain our position in our existing markets, and to adapt our existing technologies or develop new technologies for new markets.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales, marketing, and administrative personnel; internal sales and outside sales representatives' commissions; market and usability research; outside legal, accounting, and consulting costs; and other marketing and sales activities.\nAcquired intangibles amortization is the amortization of the cost of our acquired intangible assets related to customer relationships and tradenames which are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 7 years.\nImpairment of acquired intangibles represents the reduction of the carrying value of intangibles which have been determined unrecoverable.\nRestructuring costs primarily reflect severance and facilities consolidation costs related to restructuring of our operations to reduce operating costs. These headcount- and facilities-related costs were in cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative. See Note 13 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nThe litigation settlement charge reflects costs recorded in connection with certain legal proceedings further discussed under Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nEquity investment loss includes amortization of intangible assets reflected under the equity method of accounting in connection with our investment in OXi Technology Ltd. (see Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report).\nAcquisitions and Financing Activities\nOn June 11, 2017, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Conexant Systems, LLC, (the Conexant Acquisition\u201d). The Conexant Acquisition is intended to increase our presence in the smart home market and increase opportunities to grow revenue. Effective July 25, 2017, or the Closing Date, we completed the Conexant Acquisition. The results of Conexant are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period from July 25, 2017 through June 30, 2018. For further discussion of the Conexant Acquisition, see Note 4 included in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nOn June 11, 2017, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the multimedia solutions business of Marvell (the Marvell Business Acquisition\u201d). The Marvell Business Acquisition is also intended to increase our presence in the smart home market and increase opportunities to grow revenue. Effective September 8, 2017, we completed the Marvell Business Acquisition. The results of Marvell are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period from September 8, 2017 through June 30, 2018. For further discussion of the Marvell Business Acquisition, see Note 4 included in the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nOn June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the several initial purchasers named therein (collectively, the Initial Purchasers\u201d), pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and the Initial Purchasers agreed to purchase, $500 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the Notes\u201d) in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds from the Offering, after deducting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, were approximately $514.5 million, which includes proceeds from the exercise of the Initial Purchasers' option to purchase additional Notes. The Offering was completed on June 26, 2017. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, cost of revenue, inventories, product warranty, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, tax contingencies, goodwill, intangible assets, investments, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making\njudgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe methods, estimates, interpretations, and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements. The SEC considers an entity's most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of the entity's financial condition and results of operations and those that require the entity's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make assumptions and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, and title has transferred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. We accrue for estimated sales returns, incentives, and other allowances at the time we recognize revenue. Our products contain embedded firmware and software, which together with, or consisting of, our ASIC chip, deliver the essential functionality of our products and, as such, software revenue recognition guidance is not applicable. The majority of our sales to distributors are made under agreements that generally do not provide for price adjustments after purchase and provide for only limited return rights under product warranty. Revenue on these sales is recognized in the same manner as sales to our non-distributor customers. Some of our sales are to distributors which have limited stock rotation rights, which allow them to rotate a small portion of product in their inventory a maximum of two times per year. We recognize revenue to these distributors upon shipment of product to the distributor, as the stock rotation rights are limited and we can reasonably estimate expected product returns when right of return exists. When sales rebates, price allowances and stock rotations are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized.\nInventory\nWe state our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We base our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories on our projections of future demand and market conditions. Sudden declines in demand, rapid product improvements, or technological changes, or any combination of these factors can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories. On an ongoing basis, we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their net realizable value based on our forecasts of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts, additional inventory write-downs may be required. The following factors influence our estimates: changes to or cancellations of customer orders, unexpected decline in demand, rapid product improvements and technological advances, and termination or changes by our OEM customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions.\nPeriodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In those circumstances, we record a write-down, if necessary, to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. The effect of these write-downs is to establish a new cost basis in the related inventory, which we do not subsequently write up. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations, or other factors.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe have applied significant estimates and judgments in order to determine the fair value of the identified assets acquired, liabilities assumed, goodwill recognized, and contingent consideration recorded in connection with our business combinations to ensure the value of the assets and liabilities acquired are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. In measuring the fair value, we utilize valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach, or cost approach.\nThe valuation of the identifiable assets and liabilities includes assumptions made in performing the valuation, such as projected revenue, weighted average cost of capital, discount rates, estimated useful lives, estimated probabilities of achieving contingent payment milestones, and other relevant assessments. These assessments can be significantly affected by our estimates, judgments, and assumptions. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates, judgments, or assumptions, or if additional or new information arises in the future that affects our fair value estimates, then adjustments to our initial fair value estimates may have a material impact to our purchase accounting or our results of operations.\nResults of Operations\nAs a result of our recent acquisitions, we are presenting a new revenue line for revenue derived from the IoT market. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period revenue presentation to conform to the current period revenue presentation. The following sets forth certain of our consolidated statements of income data for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, along with comparative information regarding the absolute and percentage changes in these amounts (in millions, except percentages):\n\n (1) Includes the post-acquisition results of operations from Conexant, acquired on July 25, 2017, and the multimedia solutions business of Marvell, acquired on September 8, 2017 (see Note 4 Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report). \nThe following sets forth certain of our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of net revenues for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016:\n\n (1) Includes the post-acquisition results of operations from Conexant, acquired on July 25, 2017, and the multimedia solutions business of Marvell, acquired on September 8, 2017 (see Note 4 Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report). \nFiscal 2018 Compared with Fiscal 2017\nNet Revenue.\nNet revenue was $1,630.3 million for fiscal 2018 compared with $1,718.2 million for fiscal 2017, a decrease of $87.9 million, or 5.1%. Of our fiscal 2018 net revenue, $1,021.0 million, or 62.6%, of net revenue was from the mobile product applications market, $257.8 million, or 15.8%, of net revenue was from the PC product applications market, and $351.5, or 21.6%, of net revenue was from the IoT product applications market. The overall decrease in net revenue for fiscal 2018 was attributable to a $385.0 million, or 27.4%, decrease in net revenue from mobile product applications; partially offset by an increase of $268.5 million, or 323.5% increase, in net revenue from IoT product applications, and an increase of $28.6 million, or 12.5%, in net revenue from PC product applications. The decrease in mobile product applications was driven by a decrease in the units sold (34.4% less units), partially offset by an increase in average selling prices (which increased 10.6%). The increase in net revenue from IoT product applications was primarily driven by the Conexant Acquisition and the Marvell Business Acquisition. The increase in net revenue from PC product applications was driven by an increase in the units sold (3.8% more units), partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices (which decreased 19.0%).\nGross Margin.\nGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 29.4%, or $480.1 million, for fiscal 2018 compared with 30.5%, or $523.6 million, for fiscal 2017. The 110 basis point decline in gross margin was primarily due to $38.6 million of inventory fair value adjustments associated with the Conexant Acquisition and the Marvell Business Acquisition, as well as a $23.6 million increase in acquired intangibles amortization that were charged to cost of revenue during the year, partially offset by a favorable mix due primarily to IoT business products which have higher gross margins.\nWe continuously introduce new product solutions, many of which have life cycles of less than one year. Further, because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer's application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a virtual manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue.\nOperating Expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses increased $70.9 million, to $363.2 million, for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. The increase in research and development expenses primarily reflected (i) a $53.8 million increase in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from a 31.2% increase in research and development headcount due to our recent acquisitions; (ii) a $10.4 million increase in software licensing and intellectual property costs; (iii) an $8.3 million increase in infrastructure costs related to facilities; (iv) a $2.9 million increase in non-employee services; (v) a $2.5 million increase in travel related costs; (vi) partially offset by a $7.6 million decrease in supplies and project related costs.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $16.4 million, to $154.0 million, for fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected (i) a $17.8 million increase in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from a 2.4% increase in selling, general, and administrative headcount which included an increase in headcount due to our recent acquisitions; and (ii) a $2.5 million increase in non-employee services; (iii) partially offset by a $5.3 million reduction in infrastructure costs related to facilities.\nAcquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through recent acquisitions. See Note 5 Acquired Intangibles to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nImpairment of Acquired Intangibles. Impairment of acquired intangibles represents the reduction of the carrying value of intangible assets which have been determined unrecoverable.\nRestructuring costs. Restructuring costs primarily reflect employee severance costs and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of operations to reduce operating costs. These headcount-related costs included personnel in operations, research and development, and selling, general and administrative functions. Restructuring costs incurred in\nfiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were $12.0 million and $7.3 million, respectively, due to restructuring plans implemented in fiscal 2018 and 2016. The fiscal 2016 restructuring activities were completed in fiscal 2017 and the fiscal 2018 restructuring activities were completed in fiscal 2018. See Note 13 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nLitigation settlement charge. We accrued a litigation settlement charge during fiscal 2017 in connection with certain legal proceedings disclosed under Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nNon-Operating Income.\nInterest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net was $2.3 million for fiscal 2018 compared with $2.6 million for fiscal 2017.\nInterest expense. Interest expense in fiscal 2018 was $22.2 million and represents interest and amortization of debt issuance costs and discount on the $525.0 million convertible debt issued on June 26, 2017. Interest expense in fiscal 2017 was $6.0 million and represents interest on the $250.0 million in term loan and line-of-credit debt which was paid off in conjunction with the issuance of the convertible debt in fiscal 2018. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nProvision for Income Taxes.\nAs a result of the decrease in the U.S. tax rate from the comprehensive tax legislation enacted in December 2017 by the United States government, commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our U.S. statutory tax rate is lower than tax rates in many foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. This resulted in a significant increase on our effective tax rate relating to foreign tax rate differential for 2018. In addition, the effective tax for fiscal year 2018 was increased by the one-time transition tax. The foreign tax differential has had a significant downward impact on the reconciliation of our provision of the U.S. Federal statutory rate to the actual provision for taxes for each fiscal year in the two-year period ended with fiscal 2017. See Note 11 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for the table reconciling the provision for income taxes from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2018 and 2017.\nIt is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $1.9 million to an increase of $3.2 million.\nIn July 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner that found that the Treasury regulations addressing the treatment of stock-based compensation in a cost-sharing arrangement with a related party were invalid. In August 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew its July 2018 opinion to allow time for the reconstituted panel to confer on this appeal. As our tax filing position is consistent with the treasury regulations, we determined no adjustment to our financial statements is required, however, due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution, we will continue to monitor developments in this case.\nFiscal 2017 Compared with Fiscal 2016\nNet Revenue.\nNet revenue was $1,718.2 million for fiscal 2017 compared with $1,666.9 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of $51.3 million, or 3.1%. Of our fiscal 2017 net revenue, $1,406.0 million, or 81.9%, of net revenue was from the mobile product applications market, $229.2 million, or 13.3%, of net revenue was from the PC product applications market, and $83.0 million, or 4.8%, was from the IoT product applications market. The overall increase in net revenue for fiscal 2017 was attributable to an increase of $21.8 million, or 10.5%, in net revenue from PC product applications, a $21.7 million, or 35.4% increase in net revenue from IoT product applications, and a $7.8 million, or 0.6% increase in net revenue from mobile product applications, despite a 16.5% decline in revenue from our discrete display products which are incorporated into smartphones. The increase in net revenue from PC product applications was driven by an increase in the units sold (7.0% more units) as well as an increase in average selling prices (which increased 3.3%). The increase in IoT product applications was driven by an increase in the units sold (45.7% more units), partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices (which decreased 7.1%). The increase in mobile product applications was driven by an increase in the units sold (11.4% more units), partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices (which decreased 10.2%).\nGross Margin.\nGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 30.5%, or $523.6 million, for fiscal 2017 compared with 34.9%, or $581.5 million, for fiscal 2016. The 440 basis point decline in gross margin was primarily due to product mix, including the impact of lower margins on TDDI products and technical issues associated with new optical fingerprint solutions. Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was negatively impacted by the lower margins on TDDI products and fingerprint products.\nWe continuously introduce new product solutions, many of which have life cycles of less than one year. Further, because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer's application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a virtual manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. We charge losses on inventory purchase obligations and write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving, and non-usable inventory to net realizable value (including warranty costs) to cost of revenue.\nOperating Expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased $18.9 million, to $292.3 million, for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. The decrease in research and development expenses primarily reflected (i) an $11.1 million decrease in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from a 3% decrease in research and development headcount which included a reduction in headcount due to a restructuring of operations to reduce operating costs, (ii) a $6.3 million decrease in non-employee services, (iii) a $5.4 million decrease in infrastructure costs related to facilities, partially offset by a $6.2 million increase in supplies and project related costs.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $24.1 million, to $137.6 million, for fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses primarily reflected (i) an $11.6 million decrease in employee compensation and employment-related costs, resulting from an 8% decrease in selling, general, and administrative headcount which included a reduction in headcount due to a restructuring of operations to reduce operating costs, (ii) a $7.0 million decrease in legal expenses, (iii) a $5.1 million reduction in foreign currency losses, partially offset by a $2.9 million increase in facilities related costs, and (iv) a $2.7 million accrual for payroll deposit penalties related to the timing of tax deposits for stock-based compensation.\nAcquired Intangibles Amortization. Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through recent acquisitions. See Note 5 Acquired Intangibles to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nImpairment of Acquired Intangibles. Impairment of acquired intangibles represents the reduction of the carrying value of intangible assets which have been determined unrecoverable.\nRestructuring costs. Restructuring costs primarily reflect employee severance costs and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring of operations to reduce operating costs. These headcount-related costs included personnel in operations, research and development, and selling, general and administrative functions. Restructuring costs incurred in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively, were $7.3 million and $8.6 million due to restructuring plans implemented in fiscal 2016. The fiscal 2016 restructuring activities were completed in fiscal 2017. See Note 13 Restructuring Activities to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nLitigation settlement charge. We accrued a litigation settlement charge during fiscal 2017 in connection with certain legal proceedings disclosed under Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nNon-Operating Income.\nInterest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net was $2.6 million for fiscal 2017 compared with $5.2 million for fiscal 2016, resulting from an impairment recovery on investments upon redemption and a gain on legal settlement.\nInterest expense. Interest expense represents interest on the $250.0 million in debt borrowed under a term loan and line-of-credit which were paid off in fiscal 2018. See Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report.\nProvision for Income Taxes.\nOur effective tax rate is largely attributable to the tax rates in the foreign jurisdictions in which our pre-tax profit is recognized for income tax purposes. The foreign tax differential has had a significant downward impact on the reconciliation of our provision at the U.S. Federal statutory rate to the actual provision for taxes for each fiscal year in the three year period ended with fiscal 2017. While the impact of tax in foreign jurisdictions does have the most significant impact on our effective tax rate, the lower tax rate in fiscal 2016 was also driven by the permanent extension of the federal research tax credit and our ongoing tax planning. See Note 11 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for the table reconciling the provision for income taxes from the federal statutory rate for fiscal 2017 and 2016.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters in the two-year period ended June 30, 2018. The following table should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report. We have prepared this unaudited information on the same basis as our audited financial statements. This table includes all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations for the quarters presented. Past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future operating performance; accordingly, you should not draw any conclusions about our future results from the results of operations for any quarter presented.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur cash and cash equivalents were $301.0 million as of the end of fiscal 2018 compared with $367.8 million as of the end of fiscal 2017, a decrease of $66.8 million. This decrease primarily reflected cash flows used in investing and financing activities, primarily related to $396.7 million of cash used for the acquisition of businesses, $220.0 used for the payment of debt, $93.6 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock, $34.1 million used for the purchase of property and equipment, $7.7 million used for the purchase of intangible assets, partially offset by $514.5 net proceeds from issuance of convertible debt, $32.3 million proceeds from issuance of shares, and cash flows provided by operating activities of $145.0 million. We consider earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested overseas and have made no provision for income or withholding taxes, other than the one-time transition tax, that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of June 30, 2018, $153.2 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities. For fiscal 2018, the $145.0 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net loss of $124.1 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including acquired intangibles amortization of $83.9 million, share-based compensation costs of $71.3 million, and depreciation and amortization of $38.9 million, as well as other non-cash adjustments of $25.2 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $49.8 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $79.5 million decrease in inventories, an $18.8 million decrease in prepaid expenses, a $6.2 million increase in accounts payable, a $5.4 million increase in income taxes payable, partially offset by a $22.7 million increase in accounts receivable, a $22.1 million decrease in other accrued liabilities, an $8.1 million decrease in accrued compensation, and a $7.2 million increase in other assets. Our days sales outstanding increased from 54 days to 67 days from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018, due to a much smaller percentage of the quarter's net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2017 quarter compared with a much larger percentage of the quarter's net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2018 quarter. We do believe DSOs are at normalized levels which are typically between 60 to 70 days. Our inventory turns decreased to seven in fiscal 2018 from nine in 2017.\nFor fiscal 2017, the $152.9 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of $48.8 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including share-based compensation costs of $61.8 million, acquired intangibles amortization of $59.3 million, and depreciation and amortization of $33.2 million, partially offset by other non-cash adjustments of $18.3 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $31.9 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $38.4 million decrease of accounts payable, a $16.8 million decrease in acquisition related liabilities, a $9.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and a $7.8 million decrease in accrued compensation, partially offset by a $19.5 million increase in other accrued liabilities, a $15.0 million decrease in inventories, and a $6.5 million decrease in other assets. Our days sales outstanding decreased from 70 days to 54 days from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017, due to a much smaller percentage of the quarter's net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2017 quarter compared with a much larger percentage of the quarter's net revenue occurring late in the June 30, 2016 quarter. Despite the decrease in DSOs from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2017, the Company's accounts receivable, net increased from $252.6 million to $255.2 million over the same period. The 1.0% increase in accounts receivable, net is due to a significant 31.7% increase in net revenue from the three months ended June 30, 2017 to the three months ended June 30, 2016, partially offset by the fact the net revenue in the three months ended June 30, 2017 occurred more evenly through the quarter as compared to a larger percentage occurring later in the quarter in the three months ended June 30, 2016. Our inventory turns increased to nine in fiscal 2017 from six in 2016.\nFor fiscal 2016, the $256.6 million in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of $72.2 million plus adjustments for non-cash charges, including acquired intangibles amortization of $73.0 million, share-based compensation costs of $56.8 million, and depreciation and amortization of $31.2 million, partially offset by other non-cash adjustments of $6.1 million, and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $30.0 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities related primarily to a $72.0 million decrease in accounts receivable and a $9.1 million increase in other accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $26.1 million decrease in income taxes payable, an $18.2 million decrease in acquisition related liabilities, and a $15.3 million decrease in accounts payable. Our days sales outstanding increased from 61 days to 70 days from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016. Our inventory turns decreased to six in fiscal 2016 from eight in 2015.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $438.5 million, $42.3 million, and $26.6 million, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018 consisted of $396.7 million used for the acquisition of businesses, $34.1 million used for the purchase of capital assets and $7.7 million used to purchase intangible assets. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 consisted of $31.4 million used for the purchase of capital assets and $18.4 million for an equity method investment, partially offset by $7.5 million in proceeds from sales of investments. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2016 consisted of $28.6 million used for the purchase of capital assets and $4.6 million for the purchase of intangible assets, partially offset by $6.6 million in proceeds from sales of investments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash provided in financing activities for fiscal 2018 was $226.7 million and net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2017 and 2016 was $94.1 million and $281.1 million, respectively. Our net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to $514.5 million of proceeds received for issuance of convertible debt, net, $32.3 million of proceeds from issuance of shares, partially offset by $220.0 million used for the payment of debt, $93.6 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market, and $5.4 million used for payroll taxes for DSUs. Our net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to $88.0 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market, $18.8 million used for the payment of debt, $6.6 million used for payroll taxes for DSUs and MSUs, and $5.3 million used for the payment of acquisition related liabilities, partially offset by $24.7 million of proceeds from issuance of shares. Our net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to $240.6 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market, $60.9 million used for the payment of acquisition related liabilities, $15.6 million used for payroll taxes for DSUs and MSUs, and $7.6 million used for the payment of debt, partially offset by $32.4 million of proceeds from issuance of shares and $11.5 million of excess tax benefit from share-based compensation.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program. As of June 30, 2018, our Board of Directors has cumulatively authorized $1.3 billion for our common stock repurchase program, which will expire in July 2019. The program authorizes us to purchase our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The number of shares purchased and the timing of purchases is based on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities. Common stock purchased under this program is held as treasury stock. From April 2005 through the end of fiscal 2018, we purchased 27,639,876 shares of our common stock in the open market for an aggregate cost of $1.1 billion. Treasury shares purchased prior to August 28, 2008 were not subject to the stock split on that date; if adjusted for the stock split, the average cost would be $33.37. As of June 30, 2018, we had $226.1 million remaining under our common stock repurchase program.\nConvertible Debt. On June 20, 2017, we entered into a purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representative of the initial purchasers named therein, or collectively, the Initial Purchasers, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and the Initial Purchasers agreed to purchase, $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2022, or the Notes, in a private placement transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we also granted the Initial Purchasers a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $25 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, which was exercised in full on June 21, 2017. The net proceeds, after deducting the Initial Purchasers' discounts, were $514.5 million, which includes proceeds from the Initial Purchasers' exercise of their option to purchase additional Notes. We received the net proceeds on June 26, 2017, which we used to repurchase shares of our common stock, to retire our outstanding bank debt, and to provide additional cash resources to fund the Conexant and Marvell Business Acquisitions.\nThe Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per year. Interest accrued from June 26, 2017 and is payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2017. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to any our liabilities that are not so subordinated; effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries.\nThe Notes mature on June 15, 2022, or the Maturity Date, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted.\nHolders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 15, 2022 under certain defined circumstances.\nOn or after March 15, 2022 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amounts, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, at our election, shares of common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock.\nThe conversion rate for the Notes is initially 13.6947 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $73.02 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Notes indenture), holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nWe may not redeem the Notes prior to June 20, 2020. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after June 20, 2020, if the last reported sale price of our common stock, as determined by us, has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date. Our policy is to settle the principal amount of our Notes with cash upon conversion or redemption.\nBank Credit Facility.\nAt the end of fiscal 2017, we had $220.0 million principal outstanding under our Credit Agreement consisting of $100.0 million under our revolving credit facility and $120.0 million under our term loan arrangement. At the beginning of fiscal 2018, we issued $525.0 million principal amount of convertible notes and utilized a portion of the proceeds from our Notes to retire the outstanding principal and interest balances on our revolving credit facility and our term loan arrangement. At the end of July 2017, we made an election to reduce the commitment under the revolving credit facility from $450.0 million to $250.0 million as we were able to complete the Conexant Acquisition with available cash.\nIn September 2017, we entered into an Amendment and Restatement Agreement, or the Agreement, with the lenders that are party thereto, or the Lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the Lenders. The Agreement terminated our term loan arrangement and provides for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to $200 million, which includes a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. Under the terms of the Agreement, we may, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, request increases in the revolving credit facility commitments in an aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million to the extent existing or new lenders agree to provide such increased or additional commitments, as applicable. Proceeds under the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes. As of March 31, 2018, there was no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility. As a result of terminating our term loan arrangement, we expensed the remaining debt issuance costs attributable to the term loan of $1.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nThe revolving credit facility is required to be repaid in full on the earlier of (i) September 27, 2022, and (ii) the date 91 days prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes if the Notes have not been refinanced in full by such date. Debt issuance costs of $2.3 million will be amortized over 60 months.\nOur obligations under the Agreement are guaranteed by the material domestic subsidiaries of our company, subject to certain exceptions (such material subsidiaries, together with our company, collectively, the Credit Parties). The obligations of the Credit Parties under the Agreement and the other loan documents delivered in connection therewith are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future personal property of the Credit Parties, including, without limitation, 65% of the voting capital stock of certain of the Credit Parties' direct foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe revolving credit facility bears interest at our election of a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin. Swingline loans bear interest at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is a floating rate that is the greater of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, or LIBOR plus 100 basis points. The Applicable Margin is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 0.25 to 100 basis points for Base Rate loans and 100 basis points to 175 basis points for LIBOR loans. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments under the Agreement which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 0.175% to 0.25% per annum. Interest and fees are payable on a quarterly basis. As of June 30, 2018, there is no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility.\nUnder the Agreement, there are various restrictive covenants, including three financial covenants which limit the consolidated total leverage ratio, or leverage ratio, the consolidated interest coverage ratio, or interest coverage ratio, a restriction which places a limit on the amount of capital expenditures that may be made in any fiscal year, a restriction that permits up to $50 million per fiscal quarter of accounts receivable financings, and sets the Specified Leverage Ratio. The leverage ratio is the ratio of debt as of the measurement date to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The current leverage ratio shall not\nexceed 3.50 to 1.00 provided that for the four fiscal quarters ending after the date of a material acquisition, such maximum leverage ratio shall be adjusted to 3.75 to 1.00, and thereafter, shall not be more than 3.50 to 1.00. The interest coverage ratio is EBITDA to interest expense for the four consecutive quarters ending with the quarter of measurement. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 3.50 to 1.0 during the term of the Agreement. The Specified Leverage Ratio is the ratio used in determining, among other things, whether we are permitted to make dividends and/or prepay certain indebtedness, at a fixed ratio of 3.00 to 1.00.\n$100 Million Shelf Registration. We have registered an aggregate of $100.0 million of common stock and preferred stock for issuance in connection with acquisitions, which shares generally will be freely tradeable after their issuance under Rule 145 of the Securities Act unless held by an affiliate of the acquired company, in which case such shares will be subject to the volume and manner of sale restrictions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities, available credit under the Credit Agreement and net proceeds from our Notes will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months, including the Conexant Acquisition, the Marvell Business Acquisition, our contingent consideration obligations associated with the acquisition of Validity, and our debt service obligations. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, the costs of maintaining sufficient space for our expanding workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program, and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of the end of fiscal 2018 (in millions):\n\n (1) Represents the principal and interest payable through the maturity date of the underlying contractual obligation. \n (2) Purchase obligations and other commitments include payments due for inventory purchase obligations with contract manufacturers, long-term software tool licenses, and other licenses. \n (3) Represents payments retained in connection with the earn-out consideration related to the Validity acquisition. \nIn connection with the acquisition of Validity in November 2013, we entered into a contingent consideration arrangement. As of June 30, 2018, the balance represents amounts we have not paid and have retained, subject to the resolution of matters related to the Amkor Technology legal dispute (see Legal Proceedings under Note 7 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report). The earn-out period for this arrangement was complete as of March 31, 2016. We estimated the fair value of the final earn-out consideration liability as of June 30, 2018 to be $8.7 million.\nThe amounts in the table above exclude unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions of $24.8 million. As of June 30, 2018, we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur in connection with our gross unrecognized tax benefit.\nThe amounts in the table above exclude the provisional amount for our one-time transition tax liability for our foreign subsidiaries of $44.1 million. As of June 30, 2018, the amount recorded is a provisional amount and may change as we prepare our fiscal 2018 tax return.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. We have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support; engage in leasing, hedging, or research and development services; or have other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected in our financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standard update, or ASU, on Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The ASU will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when the new standard becomes effective and requires entities to recognize revenue when they transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU is effective for us in our fiscal year 2019, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We did not early adopt the new standard. The new standard permits the use of either the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method and we plan to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective transition method. Based on our assessment of the ASU and our related customer contracts and current revenue recognition methodologies and processes, the new revenue standard is not expected to have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in our consolidated financial statements. The new guidance will also require additional disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU on Leases. This update requires organizations that lease assets with lease terms of more than 12 months to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases on their balance sheets. It also requires new qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new standard will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effects of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_tables": "Table 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>
