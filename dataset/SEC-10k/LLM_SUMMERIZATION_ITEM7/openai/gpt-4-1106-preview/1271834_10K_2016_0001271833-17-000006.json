Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nReference is made to Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and non-historical information contained herein. In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of CCO Holdings, LLC and subsidiaries included in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are the second largest cable operator in the United States and a leading broadband communications services company providing video, Internet and voice services to approximately 26.2 million residential and business customers at December 31, 2016. In addition, we sell video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers and fiber-delivered communications and managed IT solutions to larger enterprise customers. We also own and operate regional sports networks and local sports, news and community channels and sell security and home management services to the residential marketplace. See Part I. Item 1. Business - Products and Services\u201d for further description of these services, including customer statistics for different services.\nSince 2012, Legacy Charter has actively invested in its network and operations and improved the quality and value of the products and packages that Legacy Charter offered. Through the roll-out of Spectrum pricing and packaging we have simplified our offers and improved our packaging of products, delivering more value to new and existing customers. Further, through the transition of our Legacy Charter markets to our all-digital platform, we increased our offerings to more than 200 HD channels in most of the Legacy Charter markets and offered Internet speeds of at least 60 or 100 Mbps, among other benefits. We believe that this product set combined with improved customer service, as we insource our workforce in our call centers and in our field operations, has led to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes.\nAs a result of the Transactions, 2016 revenues increased by over $18.6 billion year over year. We also saw an increase in expenses related to our increased scale. In September 2016, we began launching SPP to Legacy TWC markets and we expect that by mid 2017, we will offer SPP in all Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets. In 2017, we intend to begin converting the remaining Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House analog markets to an all-digital platform. Our corporate organization, as well as our marketing, sales and product development departments, are now centralized. Field operations are managed through eleven regional areas, each designed to represent a combination of designated marketing areas and managed with largely the same set of field employees that were with the three legacy companies prior to completion of the Transactions. Over a multi-year period, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House customer care centers will migrate to Legacy Charter's model of using segmented, virtualized, U.S.-based in-house call centers. We will focus on deploying superior products and service with minimal service disruptions as we integrate our information technology and network operations. We expect customer and financial results to trend similar to Legacy Charter following the implementation of the Legacy Charter operating strategies across the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets. As a result of implementing our operating strategy at Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House, we cannot be certain that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates.\nThe Company realized revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations during the periods presented as follows (in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers.

See -Use of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow\u201d for further information on Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Growth in total revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations was primarily due to the Transactions.\nOn a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, total revenue growth was primarily due to growth in our Internet and commercial businesses. On a pro forma basis, Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily due to an increase in residential and commercial revenues offset by increases in programming costs and other operating costs. In addition to the factors discussed above, income from operations on a pro forma basis was affected by increases in depreciation and amortization, merger and restructuring costs and stock compensation expense.\nApproximately 90%, 91% and 90% of our revenues for years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video, Internet, voice and commercial services provided by our cable systems. Generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for certain commercial customers. The remaining 10%, 9% and 10% of revenue for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then\npaid to local authorities), pay-per-view and VOD programming, installation, processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services.\nWe incurred the following transition costs in connection with the Transactions (in millions).\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmounts included in transition operating expenses and transition capital expenditures represent incremental costs incurred to integrate the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House operations and to bring the three companies' systems and processes into a uniform operating structure. Costs are incremental and would not be incurred absent the integration. Other operating expenses associated with the Transactions represent merger and restructuring costs and include advisory, legal and accounting fees, employee retention costs, employee termination costs and other exit costs.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCertain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. Management has discussed these policies with the Audit Committee of Charter's board of directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the following disclosure. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates, assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements, and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Property, plant and equipment\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Capitalization of labor and overhead costs\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Valuation and impairment of property, plant and equipment\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Useful lives of property, plant and equipment\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Intangible assets\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Valuation and impairment of franchises\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Valuation and impairment of goodwill\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Valuation and impairment and amortization of customer relationships\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Income taxes\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Litigation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Programming agreements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Pension plans\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimates or judgment that are not deemed critical, such as the allowance for doubtful accounts and valuations of our financial instruments, but changes in estimates or judgment in these other items could also have a material impact on our financial statements.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nThe cable industry is capital intensive, and a large portion of our resources are spent on capital activities associated with extending, rebuilding, and upgrading our cable network. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment (consisting primarily of cable distribution systems) was approximately $32.7 billion (representing 22% of total assets) and $8.3 billion (representing 48% of total assets), respectively. Total capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $5.3 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.\nCapitalization of labor and overhead costs. Costs associated with network construction, initial placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the initial placement of outlets within a dwelling along with the costs associated with the initial deployment of customer premise equipment necessary to provide video, Internet or voices services, are capitalized. Costs capitalized include materials, direct labor, and certain indirect costs. These indirect costs are associated with the activities of personnel who assist in installation activities, and consist of compensation and overhead costs associated with these support functions. While our capitalization is based on specific activities, once capitalized, we track these costs on a composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level, and not on a specific asset basis. For assets that are sold or retired, we remove the estimated applicable\ncost and accumulated depreciation. The costs of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from a dwelling and the costs to reconnect a customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expensed as incurred. Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while plant and equipment replacement, including replacement of certain components, betterments, and replacement of cable drops and outlets, are capitalized.\nWe make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized. We capitalize direct labor and overhead using standards developed from actual costs and applicable operational data. We calculate standards annually (or more frequently if circumstances dictate) for items such as the labor rates, overhead rates, and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity. For example, the standard amounts of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on studies of the time required to perform such activities. Overhead rates are established based on an analysis of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable activities, and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities. The impact of changes that resulted from these studies were not material in the periods presented.\nLabor costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized. Capitalizable activities performed in connection with installations include such activities as:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>dispatching a truck roll\u201d to the customer's dwelling or business for service connection or placement of new equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>verification of serviceability to the customer's dwelling or business (i.e., determining whether the customer's dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network and/or receiving advanced or Internet services);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>customer premise activities performed by in-house field technicians and third-party contractors in connection with customer installations, installation of equipment in connection with the installation of video, Internet or voice services, and equipment replacement and betterment; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>verifying the integrity of the customer's network connection by initiating test signals downstream from the headend to the customer's digital set-top box, as well as testing signal levels at the pole or pedestal.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nJudgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead costs incurred result from specific capital activities, and therefore should be capitalized. The primary costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities, (iii) the cost of support personnel, such as care personnel and dispatchers, who assist with capitalizable installation activities, and (iv) indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities.\nWhile we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant change in the nature or extent of our system activities could affect management's judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future. We monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies, and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies. We capitalized direct labor and overhead of $991 million, $420 million and $427 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nValuation and impairment of property, plant and equipment. We evaluate the recoverability of our property, plant and equipment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors as the impairment of our indefinite life franchises, changes in technological advances, fluctuations in the fair value of such assets, adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities, adverse changes in market conditions, or a deterioration of current or expected future operating results. A long-lived asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset. No impairments of long-lived assets to be held and used were recorded in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nWe utilize the cost approach as the primary method used to establish fair value for our property, plant and equipment in connection with business combinations. The cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility, then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation and functional and economic obsolescence as of the appraisal date. The cost approach relies on management's assumptions regarding current material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of our property, plant and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.\nUseful lives of property, plant and equipment. We evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment, based on annual analysis of such useful lives, and revise such lives to the extent warranted by changing facts and circumstances. Any changes in estimated useful lives as a result of this analysis are reflected prospectively beginning in the period in which the study is completed. Our analysis of useful lives in 2016 did not indicate a change in useful lives. The effect of a one-year decrease in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment as of December 31,\n2016 would be an increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately $1.7 billion. The effect of a one-year increase in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2016 would be a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately $863 million.\nDepreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment totaled $5.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing approximately 20%, 21% and 22% of costs and expenses, respectively. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line composite method over management's estimate of the useful lives of the related assets as listed below:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cable distribution systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7-20 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer premise equipment and installations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-8 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vehicles and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-6 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Buildings and improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15-40 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Furniture, fixtures and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6-10 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIntangible assets\nValuation and impairment of franchises. The net carrying value of franchises as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $67.3 billion (representing 45% of total assets) and $6.0 billion (representing 34% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. For more information and a complete discussion of how we value and test franchise assets for impairment, see Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWe perform an impairment assessment of franchise assets annually or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances. We performed a qualitative assessment in 2016. Our assessment included consideration of the fair value appraisals of Legacy Charter and the newly-acquired operations performed as of the date of acquisition for tax and acquisition accounting purposes, respectively, along with a multitude of factors that affect the fair value of our franchise assets. Examples of such factors include environmental and competitive changes within our operating footprint, actual and projected operating performance, the consistency of our operating margins, equity and debt market trends, including changes in our market capitalization, and changes in our regulatory and political landscape, among other factors. Based on our assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our franchise assets equals or exceeds their carrying values and that a quantitative impairment test is not required.\nThe appraisals indicated that the fair value of our franchise assets exceeded carrying value by approximately 25% in the aggregate, with the excess entirely attributable to the franchise assets of Legacy Charter to which acquisition accounting was not applied. At our unit of accounting level for franchise asset impairment testing, the amount by which fair value exceeds carrying value varies based on the extent to which the unit of accounting was comprised of newly-acquired operations. For units of accounting comprised entirely or substantially of newly-acquired operations, we believe the carrying value approximates the fair value given that there has been no significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates since the Transaction date. For units of accounting comprised of at least 25% Legacy Charter operations, the fair value exceeded carrying value by a range of 36% to 260%.\nValuation and impairment of goodwill. The net carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $29.5 billion (representing 20% of total assets) and $1.2 billion (representing 7% of total assets), respectively. For more information and a complete discussion on how we test goodwill for impairment, see Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We perform our impairment assessment of goodwill annually as of November 30th. As with our franchise impairment testing, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill in 2016 which included the fair value appraisals and other factors described above. Based on the appraisals, we determined that the fair value of our goodwill exceeded carrying value by approximately 28% as of the closing of the Transactions. Given the limited amount of time between the closing of the Transactions and the completion of the assessment and absence of significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our goodwill is not impaired.\nValuation, impairment and amortization of customer relationships. The net carrying value of customer relationships as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $14.6 billion (representing 10% of total assets) and $856 million (representing 5% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. Amortization expense related to customer relationships for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $1.9 billion, $249 million and $282\nmillion, respectively. No impairment of customer relationships was recorded in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. For more information and a complete discussion on our valuation methodology and amortization method, see Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nIncome taxes\nIn determining our tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be more likely than not\u201d of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the tax return are more likely than not\u201d of being sustained. We adjust our uncertain tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations.\nNo tax years for Charter, Charter Holdings or Charter Holdco, our indirect parent companies, for income tax purposes, are currently under examination by the IRS. Charter and Charter Holdings' 2016 tax year remains open for assessment. Legacy Charter's tax years ending 2013 through the short period return dated May 17, 2016 remain subject to examination and assessment. Years prior to 2013 remain open solely for purposes of examination of Legacy Charter's loss and credit carryforwards. The IRS is currently examining Legacy TWC's income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. Legacy TWC's tax years ending 2013 through 2015 remain subject to examination and assessment. Prior to Legacy TWC's separation from Time Warner Inc. ( Time Warner\u201d) in March 2009 (the Separation\u201d), Legacy TWC was included in the consolidated U.S. federal and certain state income tax returns of Time Warner. The IRS is currently examining Time Warner's 2008 through 2010 income tax returns. Time Warner's income tax returns for 2005 to 2007, which are periods prior to the separation, were settled with the exception of an immaterial item that has been referred to the IRS Appeals Division. We have unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties, totaling approximately $159 million as of December 31, 2016.\nLitigation\nLegal contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty. When a loss from a contingency becomes estimable and probable, a reserve is established. The reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised as facts and circumstances change. A reserve is released when a matter is ultimately brought to closure or the statute of limitations lapses. We have established reserves for certain matters. Although these matters are not expected individually to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, such matters could have, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nProgramming agreements\nWe exercise significant judgment in estimating programming expense associated with certain video programming contracts. Our policy is to record video programming costs based on our contractual agreements with our programming vendors, which are generally multi-year agreements that provide for us to make payments to the programming vendors at agreed upon market rates based on the number of customers to which we provide the programming service. If a programming contract expires prior to the parties' entry into a new agreement and we continue to distribute the service, we estimate the programming costs during the period there is no contract in place. In doing so, we consider the previous contractual rates, inflation and the status of the negotiations in determining our estimates. When the programming contract terms are finalized, an adjustment to programming expense is recorded, if necessary, to reflect the terms of the new contract. We also make estimates in the recognition of programming expense related to other items, such as the accounting for free periods, timing of rate increases and credits from service interruptions, as well as the allocation of consideration exchanged between the parties in multiple-element transactions.\nSignificant judgment is also involved when we enter into agreements that result in us receiving cash consideration from the programming vendor, usually in the form of advertising sales, channel positioning fees, launch support or marketing support. In these situations, we must determine based upon facts and circumstances if such cash consideration should be recorded as revenue, a reduction in programming expense or a reduction in another expense category (e.g., marketing).\nPension plans\nUpon completion of the TWC Transaction, we assumed Legacy TWC's pension plans. We sponsor two qualified defined benefit pension plans, the TWC Pension Plan and the TWC Union Pension Plan (collectively, the TWC Pension Plans\u201d), that provide\npension benefits to a majority of Legacy TWC employees. We also provide a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain employees under the TWC Excess Pension Plan. As of December 31, 2016, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the TWC Pension Plans was $3.3 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, and the net underfunded liability of the TWC Pension Plans was recorded as a $1 million noncurrent asset, $6 million current liability and $309 million long-term liability.\nPension benefits are based on formulas that reflect the employees' years of service and compensation during their employment period. Actuarial gains or losses are changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions. We have elected to follow a mark-to-market pension accounting policy for recording the actuarial gains or losses annually during the fourth quarter, or earlier if a remeasurement event occurs during an interim period. We use a December 31 measurement date for our pension plans.\nWe recognized a net periodic pension benefit of $813 million in 2016. Net periodic pension benefit or expense is determined using certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate and expected rate of compensation increases. We determined the discount rate used to compute pension expense based on the yield of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds with cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future defined benefit payments. In developing the expected long-term rate of return on assets, we considered the current pension portfolio's composition, past average rate of earnings, and our asset allocation targets. We used a discount rate of 3.99% from the date of the Transaction to June 30, 2016, and 3.72% from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 to compute 2016 pension expense. A decrease in the discount rate of 25 basis points would result in a $154 million increase in our pension plan benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016 and net periodic pension expense recognized in 2016 under our mark-to-market accounting policy. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to compute 2016 pension expense was 6.50%. A decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of 25 basis points, from 6.50% to 6.25%, while holding all other assumptions constant, would result in an increase in our 2017 net periodic pension expense of approximately $7 million.

Total revenues grew $19.2 billion or 197% in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and grew $646 million or 7.1% in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. Revenue growth primarily reflects the Transactions\nand increases in the number of residential Internet and triple play customers and in commercial business customers, growth in rates driven by higher equipment revenue and rate increases offset by a decrease in basic video customers. The Transactions increased revenues for year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 by approximately $18.6 billion. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, total revenue growth was 7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015.\nRevenues by service offering were as follows (dollars in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers.

The increase in operating costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the Transactions.\nThe increase in other expense is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016 compared to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 compared to 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising sales expense\n</td> <td>405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enterprise\n</td> <td>390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property tax and insurance\n</td> <td>198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bad debt expense\n</td> <td>188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock compensation expense\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank fees\n</td> <td>114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increases in other expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the corresponding prior periods were primarily due to the Transactions.\nOn a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, increases in our operating costs and expenses, exclusive of items shown separately in the consolidated statements of operations, are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016 compared to 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Programming\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory, connectivity and produced content\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs to service customers\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transition costs\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, programming costs were approximately $9.6 billion and $9.0 billion, representing 37% and 36% of total operating costs and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nProgramming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for basic, digital, premium, VOD, and pay-per-view programming. The increase in pro forma programming costs is primarily a result of annual contractual rate adjustments, including increases in amounts paid for retransmission consents and the introduction of new networks offset by synergies as a result of the Transactions and lower pay-per-view programming expenses. We expect pro forma programming expenses will continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media consolidation, increased demands by owners of broadcast stations for payment for retransmission consent or linking carriage of other services to retransmission consent, and additional programming, particularly new services. We have been unable to fully pass these increases on to our customers nor do we expect to be able to do so in the future without a potential loss of customers.\nOn a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, the increase in other expense is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016 compared to 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising sales expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate costs\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock compensation expense\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enterprise\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank fees\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in advertising sales expense relates primarily to higher advertising sales revenue. The increase in corporate costs relates primarily to increases in the number of employees including increases in engineering and IT. Stock compensation expense increased primarily due to increases in headcount and the value of equity issued.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $4.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of additional depreciation and amortization related to the Transactions, inclusive of the incremental amounts as a result of the higher fair values recorded in acquisition accounting. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $23 million in 2015 compared to 2014 which primarily represents depreciation on more recent capital expenditures offset by certain assets becoming fully depreciated.\nOther operating expenses, net. The changes in other operating expenses, net are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 compared to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 compared to 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and restructuring costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other pension benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(899\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special charges, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Gain) loss on sale of assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(266\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in merger and restructuring costs is primarily due to approximately $642 million of employee retention and employee termination costs incurred during 2016. Other pension benefits includes the pension curtailment gain of $675 million, remeasurement gain of $195 million, expected return on plan assets of $116 million offset by interest costs of $87 million. For more information, see Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nInterest expense, net. Net interest expense increased by $1.3 billion in 2016 from 2015 and decreased by $49 million in 2015 from 2014. The increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily due to $594 million of interest expense associated with the debt incurred to fund the Transactions in 2016 as well as $604 million associated with debt assumed from Legacy TWC. Net interest expense decreased in 2015 compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily as a result of a decrease in interest rates.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt of $111 million and $126 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily represents losses recognized as a result of the repurchase of CCO Holdings notes. For more information, see Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nGain (loss) on financial instruments, net. Interest rate derivative instruments are used to manage our interest costs and to reduce our exposure to increases in floating interest rates, and cross-currency derivative instruments are used to manage foreign exchange risk related to the foreign currency denominated debt assumed in the TWC Transaction. We recorded gains of $89 million and losses of $4 million and $7 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Gains and losses on financial instruments are recognized due to changes in the fair value of our interest rate and, in 2016 our cross currency derivative instruments and the remeasurement of the fixed-rate British pound sterling denominated notes (the Sterling Notes\u201d) into U.S. dollars. The year ended December 31, 2016 also includes an $11 million loss realized upon termination of Legacy TWC interest rate swap derivative instruments. For more information, see Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nOther expense, net. Other expense, net primarily represents equity losses on our equity-method investments. For more information, see Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nIncome tax benefit (expense). We recognized income tax expense of $3 million and $13 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014 and income tax benefit of $210 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The income tax benefit in 2015 was primarily due to the deemed liquidation of Charter Holdco solely for federal and state income tax purposes offset by income tax expense recognized primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities. Income tax expense was recognized in 2016 and 2014 primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities, as well as through current federal and state income tax expense. The tax provision in future periods will vary based on current and future temporary differences, as well as future operating results. For more information, see Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2016 relates to our third-party interest in CV of Viera, LLP, a consolidated joint venture in a small cable system in Florida assumed in the Transactions. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2015 and 2014 included the 2% accretion of the preferred membership interests in CC VIII, LLC ( CC VIII\u201d) plus approximately 18.6% of CC VIII's income, net of accretion. On December 31, 2015, the CC VIII preferred interest held by CCH I, LLC was contributed to CC VIII and subsequently canceled. For more information, see Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Item 1. Financial Statements.\u201d\nNet income attributable to CCO Holdings member. Net income attributable to CCO Holdings member was $1.5 billion, $308 million and $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily as a result of the factors described above. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, net income attributable to CCO Holdings member was $1.9 billion and $608 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nUse of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow\nWe use certain measures that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) to evaluate various aspects of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, consolidated net income and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. These terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are reconciled to consolidated net income and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, below.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, other pension benefits, special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. However, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and our cash cost of financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures.\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow provide information useful to investors in assessing our performance and our ability to service our debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under our credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the SEC). For the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, we use Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by our operating subsidiaries to other Charter entities. Our debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which fees were in the amount of $930 million, $322 million and $253 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Actual\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>2,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>889\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(210\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>6,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock compensation expense\n</td> <td>244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Gain) loss on derivative instruments, net\n</td> <td>(89\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>(174\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows from operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Purchases of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>(5,325\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,221\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures\n</td> <td>603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pro Forma\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>654\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>2,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(210\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>9,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock compensation expense\n</td> <td>295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Gain) loss on financial instruments, net\n</td> <td>(89\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>(200\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(137\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe have significant amounts of debt. The principal amount of our debt as of December 31, 2016 was $60.0 billion, consisting of $8.9 billion of credit facility debt, $37.7 billion of investment grade senior secured notes and $13.4 billion of high-yield senior unsecured notes. Our business requires significant cash to fund principal and interest payments on our debt.\nOur projected cash needs and projected sources of liquidity depend upon, among other things, our actual results, and the timing and amount of our expenditures. Free cash flow was $4.0 billion, $745 million and $196 million for the years ended December 31,\n2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the amount available under our credit facilities was approximately $2.8 billion and cash on hand was approximately $1.3 billion. We expect to utilize free cash flow, cash on hand and availability under our credit facilities as well as future refinancing transactions to further extend the maturities of or reduce the principal on our obligations. The timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to market conditions. Additionally, we may, from time to time, and depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from securities offerings or other borrowings to retire our debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers or redemption provisions. We believe we have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, free cash flow and Charter Operating's revolving credit facility as well as access to the capital markets to fund our projected cash needs.\nWe continue to evaluate the deployment of our cash on hand and anticipated future free cash flow including to invest in our business growth and other strategic opportunities, including mergers and acquisitions as well as distributions to our parent company for stock repurchases and dividends. Charter's target leverage remains at 4 to 4.5 times, and up to 3.5 times at the Charter Operating level. In 2016, Charter purchased approximately 5.1 million shares of its Class A common stock for approximately $1.3 billion pursuant to authorizations by Charter's board of directors of $3 billion. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2016 and provided Charter's and Charter Operating's leverage ratios remain at target, management has authority to cause Charter to purchase an additional $1.7 billion of Charter's Class A common stock without taking into account shares or units that may be purchased from A/N. Effective November 1, 2016, Charter's board of directors granted authority for a new $750 million of Class A common stock buybacks under the rolling six-month authority without taking into account any Class A common stock purchased prior to November 1. As a result, a portion of the $1.7 billion of authority is under the authority of management to approve up to $750 million for Class A common stock buybacks in any six-month period. Charter is not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the timing of any purchases that may occur cannot be predicted and will largely depend on market conditions and other potential uses of capital. Purchases may include open market purchases or negotiated transactions. To the extent such purchases occur, CCO Holdings would likely be required to fund such purchases through distributions to our parent company. As possible acquisitions, swaps or dispositions arise, we actively review them against our objectives including, among other considerations, improving the operational efficiency, clustering, product development or technology capabilities of our business and achieving appropriate return targets, and we may participate to the extent we believe these possibilities present attractive opportunities. However, there can be no assurance that we will actually complete any acquisitions, dispositions or system swaps, or that any such transactions will be material to our operations or results.\nIn December 2016, Charter and A/N exchanged 1.9 million Charter Holdings common units held by A/N for shares of Charter Class A common stock pursuant to the Letter Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $537 million. The Letter Agreement also requires A/N to sell to Charter or to Charter Holdings, on a monthly basis, a number of shares of Charter Class A common stock or Charter Holdings common units that represents a pro rata participation by A/N and its affiliates in any repurchases of shares of Charter Class A common stock from persons other than A/N effected by Charter during the immediately preceding calendar month, at a purchase price equal to the average price paid by Charter for the shares repurchased from persons other than A/N during such immediately preceding calendar month. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, Charter Holdings purchased from A/N 752,767 Charter Holdings common units at a price per unit of $289.83, or $218 million.\nRecent Events\nIn January 2017, Charter Operating entered into an amendment to its Credit Agreement decreasing the applicable LIBOR margin on both the term loan E and term loan F to 2.00% and eliminating the LIBOR floor.\nIn February 2017, CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital Corp. closed on transactions in which they issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2027. The net proceeds were used to redeem CCO Holdings' 6.625% senior notes due 2022, pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow increased $3.3 billion and $549 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the corresponding prior periods, respectively, due to the following.\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to\nyear ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared to\nyear ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Increase) decrease in capital expenditures\n</td> <td>(3,485\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>381\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in working capital, excluding change in accrued interest, net of effects from acquisitions\n</td> <td>1,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in cash paid for interest, net\n</td> <td>(1,355\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in merger and restructuring costs\n</td> <td>(390\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>549\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our payment obligations as of December 31, 2016 under our long-term debt and certain other contractual obligations and commitments inclusive of parent company obligations and commitments, the expense of which are pushed down to us (dollars in millions.)\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt Principal Payments (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt Interest Payments (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital and Operating Lease Obligations (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Programming Minimum Commitments (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>The table presents maturities of long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2016.

Business - Transaction-Related Commitments\" for a listing of commitments as a result of the Transactions.\nHistorical Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities\nCash and Cash Equivalents. We held $1.3 billion and $5 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $6.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $7.2 billion offset by an increase in cash paid for interest, net of $1.4 billion.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $173 million from $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $216 million offset by a $32 million increase in merger and acquisition costs.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $4.8 billion and net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.7 billion. The increase in cash used was primarily due to the repayment in 2015 of $3.5 billion of net proceeds held in escrow upon the termination of the proposed transactions with Comcast as well as an increase in capital expenditures of $3.5 billion.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.7 billion and net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $5.7 billion. The increase in cash provided in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due a decrease in long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents upon repayment of the Term G Loans out of escrow related to the proposed transactions with Comcast and a decrease in capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $2.7 billion and $4.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net cash provided in financing activities was $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in cash used in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the repayment in 2015 of $3.5 billion of net proceeds\nheld in escrow upon the termination of the proposed transactions with Comcast.\nThe increase in cash used during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2014 was primarily the result of the repayment of $3.5 billion of net proceeds held in escrow related to the Term G Loans upon the termination of the Comcast Transactions.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements. Capital expenditures were $5.3 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase was driven by the Transactions. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, the increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared\nto the corresponding prior period was driven by higher product development investments, transition capital expenditures incurred in connection with the Transactions and support capital investments. See the table below for more details.\nThe actual amount of our capital expenditures in 2017 will depend on a number of factors, including the pace of transition planning to service a larger customer base as a result of the Transactions, our all-digital transition in the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets and growth rates of both our residential and commercial businesses.\nOur capital expenditures are funded primarily from cash flows from operating activities and borrowings on our credit facility. In addition, our liabilities related to capital expenditures increased by $603 million, $28 million and $33 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe following tables present our major capital expenditures categories on an actual and pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, in accordance with National Cable and Telecommunications Association ( NCTA\u201d) disclosure guidelines for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The disclosure is intended to provide more consistency in the reporting of capital expenditures among peer companies in the cable industry. These disclosure guidelines are not required disclosures under GAAP, nor do they impact our accounting for capital expenditures under GAAP (dollars in millions):\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actual\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer premise equipment (a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Scalable infrastructure (b)\n</td> <td>1,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line extensions (c)\n</td> <td>721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Upgrade/rebuild (d)\n</td> <td>456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Support capital (e)\n</td> <td>894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures included in total related to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transition (f)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All-digital transition\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro Forma\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer premise equipment (a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Scalable infrastructure (b)\n</td> <td>2,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line extensions (c)\n</td> <td>1,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Upgrade/rebuild (d)\n</td> <td>610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Support capital (e)\n</td> <td>1,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Customer premise equipment includes costs incurred at the customer residence to secure new customers and revenue generating units.

In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of CCO Holdings, LLC and subsidiaries included in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are the second largest cable operator in the United States and a leading broadband communications services company providing video, Internet and voice services to approximately 26.2 million residential and business customers at December 31, 2016. In addition, we sell video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers and fiber-delivered communications and managed IT solutions to larger enterprise customers. We also own and operate regional sports networks and local sports, news and community channels and sell security and home management services to the residential marketplace. See Part I. Item 1. Business - Products and Services\u201d for further description of these services, including customer statistics for different services.\nSince 2012, Legacy Charter has actively invested in its network and operations and improved the quality and value of the products and packages that Legacy Charter offered. Through the roll-out of Spectrum pricing and packaging we have simplified our offers and improved our packaging of products, delivering more value to new and existing customers. Further, through the transition of our Legacy Charter markets to our all-digital platform, we increased our offerings to more than 200 HD channels in most of the Legacy Charter markets and offered Internet speeds of at least 60 or 100 Mbps, among other benefits. We believe that this product set combined with improved customer service, as we insource our workforce in our call centers and in our field operations, has led to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes.\nAs a result of the Transactions, 2016 revenues increased by over $18.6 billion year over year. We also saw an increase in expenses related to our increased scale. In September 2016, we began launching SPP to Legacy TWC markets and we expect that by mid 2017, we will offer SPP in all Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets. In 2017, we intend to begin converting the remaining Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House analog markets to an all-digital platform. Our corporate organization, as well as our marketing, sales and product development departments, are now centralized. Field operations are managed through eleven regional areas, each designed to represent a combination of designated marketing areas and managed with largely the same set of field employees that were with the three legacy companies prior to completion of the Transactions. Over a multi-year period, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House customer care centers will migrate to Legacy Charter's model of using segmented, virtualized, U.S.-based in-house call centers. We will focus on deploying superior products and service with minimal service disruptions as we integrate our information technology and network operations. We expect customer and financial results to trend similar to Legacy Charter following the implementation of the Legacy Charter operating strategies across the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets. As a result of implementing our operating strategy at Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House, we cannot be certain that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates.\nThe Company realized revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations during the periods presented as follows (in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers.

See -Use of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow\u201d for further information on Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Growth in total revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations was primarily due to the Transactions.\nOn a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, total revenue growth was primarily due to growth in our Internet and commercial businesses. On a pro forma basis, Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily due to an increase in residential and commercial revenues offset by increases in programming costs and other operating costs. In addition to the factors discussed above, income from operations on a pro forma basis was affected by increases in depreciation and amortization, merger and restructuring costs and stock compensation expense.\nApproximately 90%, 91% and 90% of our revenues for years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video, Internet, voice and commercial services provided by our cable systems. Generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for certain commercial customers. The remaining 10%, 9% and 10% of revenue for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then\npaid to local authorities), pay-per-view and VOD programming, installation, processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services.\nWe incurred the following transition costs in connection with the Transactions (in millions).\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmounts included in transition operating expenses and transition capital expenditures represent incremental costs incurred to integrate the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House operations and to bring the three companies' systems and processes into a uniform operating structure. Costs are incremental and would not be incurred absent the integration. Other operating expenses associated with the Transactions represent merger and restructuring costs and include advisory, legal and accounting fees, employee retention costs, employee termination costs and other exit costs.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCertain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. Management has discussed these policies with the Audit Committee of Charter's board of directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the following disclosure. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates, assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements, and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows:\n \u2022 Property, plant and equipment \n \u2022 Capitalization of labor and overhead costs \n \u2022 Valuation and impairment of property, plant and equipment \n \u2022 Useful lives of property, plant and equipment \n \u2022 Intangible assets \n \u2022 Valuation and impairment of franchises \n \u2022 Valuation and impairment of goodwill \n \u2022 Valuation and impairment and amortization of customer relationships \n \u2022 Income taxes \n \u2022 Litigation \n \u2022 Programming agreements \n \u2022 Pension plans \nIn addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimates or judgment that are not deemed critical, such as the allowance for doubtful accounts and valuations of our financial instruments, but changes in estimates or judgment in these other items could also have a material impact on our financial statements.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nThe cable industry is capital intensive, and a large portion of our resources are spent on capital activities associated with extending, rebuilding, and upgrading our cable network. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment (consisting primarily of cable distribution systems) was approximately $32.7 billion (representing 22% of total assets) and $8.3 billion (representing 48% of total assets), respectively. Total capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $5.3 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.\nCapitalization of labor and overhead costs. Costs associated with network construction, initial placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the initial placement of outlets within a dwelling along with the costs associated with the initial deployment of customer premise equipment necessary to provide video, Internet or voices services, are capitalized. Costs capitalized include materials, direct labor, and certain indirect costs. These indirect costs are associated with the activities of personnel who assist in installation activities, and consist of compensation and overhead costs associated with these support functions. While our capitalization is based on specific activities, once capitalized, we track these costs on a composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level, and not on a specific asset basis. For assets that are sold or retired, we remove the estimated applicable\ncost and accumulated depreciation. The costs of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from a dwelling and the costs to reconnect a customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expensed as incurred. Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while plant and equipment replacement, including replacement of certain components, betterments, and replacement of cable drops and outlets, are capitalized.\nWe make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized. We capitalize direct labor and overhead using standards developed from actual costs and applicable operational data. We calculate standards annually (or more frequently if circumstances dictate) for items such as the labor rates, overhead rates, and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity. For example, the standard amounts of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on studies of the time required to perform such activities. Overhead rates are established based on an analysis of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable activities, and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities. The impact of changes that resulted from these studies were not material in the periods presented.\nLabor costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized. Capitalizable activities performed in connection with installations include such activities as:\n \u2022 dispatching a truck roll\u201d to the customer's dwelling or business for service connection or placement of new equipment; \n \u2022 verification of serviceability to the customer's dwelling or business (i.e., determining whether the customer's dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network and/or receiving advanced or Internet services); \n \u2022 customer premise activities performed by in-house field technicians and third-party contractors in connection with customer installations, installation of equipment in connection with the installation of video, Internet or voice services, and equipment replacement and betterment; and \n \u2022 verifying the integrity of the customer's network connection by initiating test signals downstream from the headend to the customer's digital set-top box, as well as testing signal levels at the pole or pedestal. \nJudgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead costs incurred result from specific capital activities, and therefore should be capitalized. The primary costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities, (iii) the cost of support personnel, such as care personnel and dispatchers, who assist with capitalizable installation activities, and (iv) indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities.\nWhile we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant change in the nature or extent of our system activities could affect management's judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future. We monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies, and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies. We capitalized direct labor and overhead of $991 million, $420 million and $427 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nValuation and impairment of property, plant and equipment. We evaluate the recoverability of our property, plant and equipment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors as the impairment of our indefinite life franchises, changes in technological advances, fluctuations in the fair value of such assets, adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities, adverse changes in market conditions, or a deterioration of current or expected future operating results. A long-lived asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset. No impairments of long-lived assets to be held and used were recorded in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nWe utilize the cost approach as the primary method used to establish fair value for our property, plant and equipment in connection with business combinations. The cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility, then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation and functional and economic obsolescence as of the appraisal date. The cost approach relies on management's assumptions regarding current material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of our property, plant and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.\nUseful lives of property, plant and equipment. We evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment, based on annual analysis of such useful lives, and revise such lives to the extent warranted by changing facts and circumstances. Any changes in estimated useful lives as a result of this analysis are reflected prospectively beginning in the period in which the study is completed. Our analysis of useful lives in 2016 did not indicate a change in useful lives. The effect of a one-year decrease in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment as of December 31,\n2016 would be an increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately $1.7 billion. The effect of a one-year increase in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2016 would be a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately $863 million.\nDepreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment totaled $5.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing approximately 20%, 21% and 22% of costs and expenses, respectively. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line composite method over management's estimate of the useful lives of the related assets as listed below:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cable distribution systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7-20 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer premise equipment and installations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-8 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vehicles and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-6 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Buildings and improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15-40 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Furniture, fixtures and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6-10 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIntangible assets\nValuation and impairment of franchises. The net carrying value of franchises as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $67.3 billion (representing 45% of total assets) and $6.0 billion (representing 34% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. For more information and a complete discussion of how we value and test franchise assets for impairment, see Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWe perform an impairment assessment of franchise assets annually or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances. We performed a qualitative assessment in 2016. Our assessment included consideration of the fair value appraisals of Legacy Charter and the newly-acquired operations performed as of the date of acquisition for tax and acquisition accounting purposes, respectively, along with a multitude of factors that affect the fair value of our franchise assets. Examples of such factors include environmental and competitive changes within our operating footprint, actual and projected operating performance, the consistency of our operating margins, equity and debt market trends, including changes in our market capitalization, and changes in our regulatory and political landscape, among other factors. Based on our assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our franchise assets equals or exceeds their carrying values and that a quantitative impairment test is not required.\nThe appraisals indicated that the fair value of our franchise assets exceeded carrying value by approximately 25% in the aggregate, with the excess entirely attributable to the franchise assets of Legacy Charter to which acquisition accounting was not applied. At our unit of accounting level for franchise asset impairment testing, the amount by which fair value exceeds carrying value varies based on the extent to which the unit of accounting was comprised of newly-acquired operations. For units of accounting comprised entirely or substantially of newly-acquired operations, we believe the carrying value approximates the fair value given that there has been no significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates since the Transaction date. For units of accounting comprised of at least 25% Legacy Charter operations, the fair value exceeded carrying value by a range of 36% to 260%.\nValuation and impairment of goodwill. The net carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $29.5 billion (representing 20% of total assets) and $1.2 billion (representing 7% of total assets), respectively. For more information and a complete discussion on how we test goodwill for impairment, see Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We perform our impairment assessment of goodwill annually as of November 30th. As with our franchise impairment testing, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill in 2016 which included the fair value appraisals and other factors described above. Based on the appraisals, we determined that the fair value of our goodwill exceeded carrying value by approximately 28% as of the closing of the Transactions. Given the limited amount of time between the closing of the Transactions and the completion of the assessment and absence of significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our goodwill is not impaired.\nValuation, impairment and amortization of customer relationships. The net carrying value of customer relationships as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $14.6 billion (representing 10% of total assets) and $856 million (representing 5% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. Amortization expense related to customer relationships for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $1.9 billion, $249 million and $282\nmillion, respectively. No impairment of customer relationships was recorded in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. For more information and a complete discussion on our valuation methodology and amortization method, see Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nIncome taxes\nIn determining our tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be more likely than not\u201d of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the tax return are more likely than not\u201d of being sustained. We adjust our uncertain tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations.\nNo tax years for Charter, Charter Holdings or Charter Holdco, our indirect parent companies, for income tax purposes, are currently under examination by the IRS. Charter and Charter Holdings' 2016 tax year remains open for assessment. Legacy Charter's tax years ending 2013 through the short period return dated May 17, 2016 remain subject to examination and assessment. Years prior to 2013 remain open solely for purposes of examination of Legacy Charter's loss and credit carryforwards. The IRS is currently examining Legacy TWC's income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. Legacy TWC's tax years ending 2013 through 2015 remain subject to examination and assessment. Prior to Legacy TWC's separation from Time Warner Inc. ( Time Warner\u201d) in March 2009 (the Separation\u201d), Legacy TWC was included in the consolidated U.S. federal and certain state income tax returns of Time Warner. The IRS is currently examining Time Warner's 2008 through 2010 income tax returns. Time Warner's income tax returns for 2005 to 2007, which are periods prior to the separation, were settled with the exception of an immaterial item that has been referred to the IRS Appeals Division. We have unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties, totaling approximately $159 million as of December 31, 2016.\nLitigation\nLegal contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty. When a loss from a contingency becomes estimable and probable, a reserve is established. The reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised as facts and circumstances change. A reserve is released when a matter is ultimately brought to closure or the statute of limitations lapses. We have established reserves for certain matters. Although these matters are not expected individually to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, such matters could have, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nProgramming agreements\nWe exercise significant judgment in estimating programming expense associated with certain video programming contracts. Our policy is to record video programming costs based on our contractual agreements with our programming vendors, which are generally multi-year agreements that provide for us to make payments to the programming vendors at agreed upon market rates based on the number of customers to which we provide the programming service. If a programming contract expires prior to the parties' entry into a new agreement and we continue to distribute the service, we estimate the programming costs during the period there is no contract in place. In doing so, we consider the previous contractual rates, inflation and the status of the negotiations in determining our estimates. When the programming contract terms are finalized, an adjustment to programming expense is recorded, if necessary, to reflect the terms of the new contract. We also make estimates in the recognition of programming expense related to other items, such as the accounting for free periods, timing of rate increases and credits from service interruptions, as well as the allocation of consideration exchanged between the parties in multiple-element transactions.\nSignificant judgment is also involved when we enter into agreements that result in us receiving cash consideration from the programming vendor, usually in the form of advertising sales, channel positioning fees, launch support or marketing support. In these situations, we must determine based upon facts and circumstances if such cash consideration should be recorded as revenue, a reduction in programming expense or a reduction in another expense category (e.g., marketing).\nPension plans\nUpon completion of the TWC Transaction, we assumed Legacy TWC's pension plans. We sponsor two qualified defined benefit pension plans, the TWC Pension Plan and the TWC Union Pension Plan (collectively, the TWC Pension Plans\u201d), that provide\npension benefits to a majority of Legacy TWC employees. We also provide a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain employees under the TWC Excess Pension Plan. As of December 31, 2016, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the TWC Pension Plans was $3.3 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, and the net underfunded liability of the TWC Pension Plans was recorded as a $1 million noncurrent asset, $6 million current liability and $309 million long-term liability.\nPension benefits are based on formulas that reflect the employees' years of service and compensation during their employment period. Actuarial gains or losses are changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions. We have elected to follow a mark-to-market pension accounting policy for recording the actuarial gains or losses annually during the fourth quarter, or earlier if a remeasurement event occurs during an interim period. We use a December 31 measurement date for our pension plans.\nWe recognized a net periodic pension benefit of $813 million in 2016. Net periodic pension benefit or expense is determined using certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate and expected rate of compensation increases. We determined the discount rate used to compute pension expense based on the yield of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds with cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future defined benefit payments. In developing the expected long-term rate of return on assets, we considered the current pension portfolio's composition, past average rate of earnings, and our asset allocation targets. We used a discount rate of 3.99% from the date of the Transaction to June 30, 2016, and 3.72% from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 to compute 2016 pension expense. A decrease in the discount rate of 25 basis points would result in a $154 million increase in our pension plan benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016 and net periodic pension expense recognized in 2016 under our mark-to-market accounting policy. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to compute 2016 pension expense was 6.50%. A decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of 25 basis points, from 6.50% to 6.25%, while holding all other assumptions constant, would result in an increase in our 2017 net periodic pension expense of approximately $7 million. See Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional discussion on these assumptions.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share data):\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs and expenses (exclusive of items shown separately below)\n</td> <td>18,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>6,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating (income) expenses, net\n</td> <td>(177\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>25,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>3,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>971\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>(2,123\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(889\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>(111\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(126\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on financial instruments, net\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(2,148\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(970\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(896\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>1,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income\n</td> <td>1,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to CCO Holdings member\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues. Total revenues grew $19.2 billion or 197% in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and grew $646 million or 7.1% in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. Revenue growth primarily reflects the Transactions\nand increases in the number of residential Internet and triple play customers and in commercial business customers, growth in rates driven by higher equipment revenue and rate increases offset by a decrease in basic video customers. The Transactions increased revenues for year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 by approximately $18.6 billion. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, total revenue growth was 7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015.\nRevenues by service offering were as follows (dollars in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers.

The Transactions increased enterprise commercial revenues for year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 by approximately $1.0 billion. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, enterprise commercial revenues increased $207 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to growth in customers.\nAdvertising sales revenues consist primarily of revenues from commercial advertising customers, programmers and other vendors, as well as local cable and advertising on regional sports and news channels. Advertising sales revenues increased in 2016 primarily due to the Transactions and decreased in 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease in political advertising. The Transactions increased advertising sales revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 by $898 million. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, advertising sales revenues increased $172 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in political advertising.\nOther revenues consist of revenue from regional sports and news channels (excluding intercompany charges or advertising sales on those channels), home shopping, late payment fees, wire maintenance fees and other miscellaneous revenues. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to the Transactions. The Transactions increased other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 by $429 million. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, other revenues increased $33 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a settlement related to an early contract termination.\nOperating costs and expenses.

The increase in pro forma programming costs is primarily a result of annual contractual rate adjustments, including increases in amounts paid for retransmission consents and the introduction of new networks offset by synergies as a result of the Transactions and lower pay-per-view programming expenses. We expect pro forma programming expenses will continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media consolidation, increased demands by owners of broadcast stations for payment for retransmission consent or linking carriage of other services to retransmission consent, and additional programming, particularly new services. We have been unable to fully pass these increases on to our customers nor do we expect to be able to do so in the future without a potential loss of customers.\nOn a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, the increase in other expense is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016 compared to 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising sales expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate costs\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock compensation expense\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enterprise\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank fees\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in advertising sales expense relates primarily to higher advertising sales revenue. The increase in corporate costs relates primarily to increases in the number of employees including increases in engineering and IT. Stock compensation expense increased primarily due to increases in headcount and the value of equity issued.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $4.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of additional depreciation and amortization related to the Transactions, inclusive of the incremental amounts as a result of the higher fair values recorded in acquisition accounting. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $23 million in 2015 compared to 2014 which primarily represents depreciation on more recent capital expenditures offset by certain assets becoming fully depreciated.\nOther operating expenses, net. The changes in other operating expenses, net are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 compared to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 compared to 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and restructuring costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other pension benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(899\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special charges, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Gain) loss on sale of assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(266\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in merger and restructuring costs is primarily due to approximately $642 million of employee retention and employee termination costs incurred during 2016. Other pension benefits includes the pension curtailment gain of $675 million, remeasurement gain of $195 million, expected return on plan assets of $116 million offset by interest costs of $87 million. For more information, see Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nInterest expense, net. Net interest expense increased by $1.3 billion in 2016 from 2015 and decreased by $49 million in 2015 from 2014. The increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily due to $594 million of interest expense associated with the debt incurred to fund the Transactions in 2016 as well as $604 million associated with debt assumed from Legacy TWC. Net interest expense decreased in 2015 compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily as a result of a decrease in interest rates.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt of $111 million and $126 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily represents losses recognized as a result of the repurchase of CCO Holdings notes. For more information, see Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nGain (loss) on financial instruments, net. Interest rate derivative instruments are used to manage our interest costs and to reduce our exposure to increases in floating interest rates, and cross-currency derivative instruments are used to manage foreign exchange risk related to the foreign currency denominated debt assumed in the TWC Transaction. We recorded gains of $89 million and losses of $4 million and $7 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Gains and losses on financial instruments are recognized due to changes in the fair value of our interest rate and, in 2016 our cross currency derivative instruments and the remeasurement of the fixed-rate British pound sterling denominated notes (the Sterling Notes\u201d) into U.S. dollars. The year ended December 31, 2016 also includes an $11 million loss realized upon termination of Legacy TWC interest rate swap derivative instruments. For more information, see Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nOther expense, net. Other expense, net primarily represents equity losses on our equity-method investments. For more information, see Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nIncome tax benefit (expense). We recognized income tax expense of $3 million and $13 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014 and income tax benefit of $210 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The income tax benefit in 2015 was primarily due to the deemed liquidation of Charter Holdco solely for federal and state income tax purposes offset by income tax expense recognized primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities. Income tax expense was recognized in 2016 and 2014 primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities, as well as through current federal and state income tax expense. The tax provision in future periods will vary based on current and future temporary differences, as well as future operating results. For more information, see Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2016 relates to our third-party interest in CV of Viera, LLP, a consolidated joint venture in a small cable system in Florida assumed in the Transactions. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2015 and 2014 included the 2% accretion of the preferred membership interests in CC VIII, LLC ( CC VIII\u201d) plus approximately 18.6% of CC VIII's income, net of accretion. On December 31, 2015, the CC VIII preferred interest held by CCH I, LLC was contributed to CC VIII and subsequently canceled. For more information, see Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Item 1. Financial Statements.\u201d\nNet income attributable to CCO Holdings member. Net income attributable to CCO Holdings member was $1.5 billion, $308 million and $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily as a result of the factors described above. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, net income attributable to CCO Holdings member was $1.9 billion and $608 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nUse of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow\nWe use certain measures that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) to evaluate various aspects of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, consolidated net income and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. These terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are reconciled to consolidated net income and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, below.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, other pension benefits, special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. However, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and our cash cost of financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures.\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow provide information useful to investors in assessing our performance and our ability to service our debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under our credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the SEC). For the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, we use Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by our operating subsidiaries to other Charter entities. Our debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which fees were in the amount of $930 million, $322 million and $253 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Actual\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>2,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>889\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(210\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>6,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,102\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock compensation expense\n</td> <td>244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Gain) loss on derivative instruments, net\n</td> <td>(89\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>(174\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows from operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Purchases of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>(5,325\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,840\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,221\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures\n</td> <td>603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pro Forma\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>654\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>2,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(210\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>9,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock compensation expense\n</td> <td>295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Gain) loss on financial instruments, net\n</td> <td>(89\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>(200\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(137\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe have significant amounts of debt. The principal amount of our debt as of December 31, 2016 was $60.0 billion, consisting of $8.9 billion of credit facility debt, $37.7 billion of investment grade senior secured notes and $13.4 billion of high-yield senior unsecured notes. Our business requires significant cash to fund principal and interest payments on our debt.\nOur projected cash needs and projected sources of liquidity depend upon, among other things, our actual results, and the timing and amount of our expenditures. Free cash flow was $4.0 billion, $745 million and $196 million for the years ended December 31,\n2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the amount available under our credit facilities was approximately $2.8 billion and cash on hand was approximately $1.3 billion. We expect to utilize free cash flow, cash on hand and availability under our credit facilities as well as future refinancing transactions to further extend the maturities of or reduce the principal on our obligations. The timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to market conditions. Additionally, we may, from time to time, and depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from securities offerings or other borrowings to retire our debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers or redemption provisions. We believe we have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, free cash flow and Charter Operating's revolving credit facility as well as access to the capital markets to fund our projected cash needs.\nWe continue to evaluate the deployment of our cash on hand and anticipated future free cash flow including to invest in our business growth and other strategic opportunities, including mergers and acquisitions as well as distributions to our parent company for stock repurchases and dividends. Charter's target leverage remains at 4 to 4.5 times, and up to 3.5 times at the Charter Operating level. In 2016, Charter purchased approximately 5.1 million shares of its Class A common stock for approximately $1.3 billion pursuant to authorizations by Charter's board of directors of $3 billion. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2016 and provided Charter's and Charter Operating's leverage ratios remain at target, management has authority to cause Charter to purchase an additional $1.7 billion of Charter's Class A common stock without taking into account shares or units that may be purchased from A/N. Effective November 1, 2016, Charter's board of directors granted authority for a new $750 million of Class A common stock buybacks under the rolling six-month authority without taking into account any Class A common stock purchased prior to November 1. As a result, a portion of the $1.7 billion of authority is under the authority of management to approve up to $750 million for Class A common stock buybacks in any six-month period. Charter is not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the timing of any purchases that may occur cannot be predicted and will largely depend on market conditions and other potential uses of capital. Purchases may include open market purchases or negotiated transactions. To the extent such purchases occur, CCO Holdings would likely be required to fund such purchases through distributions to our parent company. As possible acquisitions, swaps or dispositions arise, we actively review them against our objectives including, among other considerations, improving the operational efficiency, clustering, product development or technology capabilities of our business and achieving appropriate return targets, and we may participate to the extent we believe these possibilities present attractive opportunities. However, there can be no assurance that we will actually complete any acquisitions, dispositions or system swaps, or that any such transactions will be material to our operations or results.\nIn December 2016, Charter and A/N exchanged 1.9 million Charter Holdings common units held by A/N for shares of Charter Class A common stock pursuant to the Letter Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $537 million. The Letter Agreement also requires A/N to sell to Charter or to Charter Holdings, on a monthly basis, a number of shares of Charter Class A common stock or Charter Holdings common units that represents a pro rata participation by A/N and its affiliates in any repurchases of shares of Charter Class A common stock from persons other than A/N effected by Charter during the immediately preceding calendar month, at a purchase price equal to the average price paid by Charter for the shares repurchased from persons other than A/N during such immediately preceding calendar month. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, Charter Holdings purchased from A/N 752,767 Charter Holdings common units at a price per unit of $289.83, or $218 million.\nRecent Events\nIn January 2017, Charter Operating entered into an amendment to its Credit Agreement decreasing the applicable LIBOR margin on both the term loan E and term loan F to 2.00% and eliminating the LIBOR floor.\nIn February 2017, CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital Corp. closed on transactions in which they issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2027. The net proceeds were used to redeem CCO Holdings' 6.625% senior notes due 2022, pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow increased $3.3 billion and $549 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the corresponding prior periods, respectively, due to the following.\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31, 2016\ncompared to\nyear ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31, 2015\ncompared to\nyear ended\nDecember 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Increase) decrease in capital expenditures\n</td> <td>(3,485\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>381\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in working capital, excluding change in accrued interest, net of effects from acquisitions\n</td> <td>1,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in cash paid for interest, net\n</td> <td>(1,355\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in merger and restructuring costs\n</td> <td>(390\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>549\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our payment obligations as of December 31, 2016 under our long-term debt and certain other contractual obligations and commitments inclusive of parent company obligations and commitments, the expense of which are pushed down to us (dollars in millions.)\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt Principal Payments (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt Interest Payments (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital and Operating Lease Obligations (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Programming Minimum Commitments (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (e)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) The table presents maturities of long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2016. Refer to Notes 9 and 18 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a description of our long-term debt and other contractual obligations and commitments. \n (b) Interest payments on variable debt are estimated using amounts outstanding at December 31, 2016 and the average implied forward London Interbank Offering Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) rates applicable for the quarter during the interest rate reset based on the yield curve in effect at December 31, 2016. Actual interest payments will differ based on actual LIBOR rates and actual amounts outstanding for applicable periods. \n (c) We lease certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable capital and operating leases. Leases and rental costs charged to expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were $215 million, $49 million and $43 million, respectively. \n (d) We pay programming fees under multi-year contracts typically based on a flat fee per customer, which may be fixed for the term, or may in some cases escalate over the term. Programming costs included in the accompanying statement of operations were approximately $7.0 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Certain of our programming agreements are based on a flat fee per month or have guaranteed minimum payments. The table sets forth the aggregate guaranteed minimum commitments under our programming contracts. \n (e) Other\u201d represents other guaranteed minimum commitments, including rights negotiated directly with content owners for distribution on company-owned channels or networks and commitments related to our role as an advertising and distribution sales agent for third party-owned channels or networks as well as commitments to our customer premise equipment vendors. \nThe following items are not included in the contractual obligations table because the obligations are not fixed and/or determinable due to various factors discussed below. However, we incur these costs as part of our operations:\n \u2022 We rent utility poles used in our operations. Generally, pole rentals are cancelable on short notice, but we anticipate that such rentals will recur. Rent expense incurred for pole rental attachments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $115 million, $53 million and $49 million, respectively. \n \u2022 We pay franchise fees under multi-year franchise agreements based on a percentage of revenues generated from video service per year. We also pay other franchise related costs, such as public education grants, under multi-year agreements. Franchise fees and other franchise-related costs included in the accompanying statement of operations were $534 million, $212 million and $208 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n \u2022 We also have $278 million in letters of credit, of which $220 million is secured under the Charter Operating credit facility, primarily to our various casualty carriers as collateral for reimbursement of workers' compensation, auto liability and general liability claims. \n \u2022 Minimum pension funding requirements have not been presented in the table above as such amounts have not been determined beyond 2016. We made no cash contributions to the qualified pension plans in 2016; however, we are permitted to make discretionary cash contributions to the qualified pension plans in 2017. For the nonqualified pension plan, we contributed $5 million during 2016 and will continue to make contributions in 2017 to the extent benefits are paid. \nSee \"Part I. Item 1. Business - Transaction-Related Commitments\" for a listing of commitments as a result of the Transactions.\nHistorical Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities\nCash and Cash Equivalents. We held $1.3 billion and $5 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $6.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $7.2 billion offset by an increase in cash paid for interest, net of $1.4 billion.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $173 million from $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $216 million offset by a $32 million increase in merger and acquisition costs.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $4.8 billion and net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.7 billion. The increase in cash used was primarily due to the repayment in 2015 of $3.5 billion of net proceeds held in escrow upon the termination of the proposed transactions with Comcast as well as an increase in capital expenditures of $3.5 billion.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.7 billion and net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $5.7 billion. The increase in cash provided in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due a decrease in long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents upon repayment of the Term G Loans out of escrow related to the proposed transactions with Comcast and a decrease in capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $2.7 billion and $4.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net cash provided in financing activities was $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in cash used in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the repayment in 2015 of $3.5 billion of net proceeds\nheld in escrow upon the termination of the proposed transactions with Comcast.\nThe increase in cash used during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2014 was primarily the result of the repayment of $3.5 billion of net proceeds held in escrow related to the Term G Loans upon the termination of the Comcast Transactions.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements. Capital expenditures were $5.3 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase was driven by the Transactions. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, the increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared\nto the corresponding prior period was driven by higher product development investments, transition capital expenditures incurred in connection with the Transactions and support capital investments. See the table below for more details.\nThe actual amount of our capital expenditures in 2017 will depend on a number of factors, including the pace of transition planning to service a larger customer base as a result of the Transactions, our all-digital transition in the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets and growth rates of both our residential and commercial businesses.\nOur capital expenditures are funded primarily from cash flows from operating activities and borrowings on our credit facility. In addition, our liabilities related to capital expenditures increased by $603 million, $28 million and $33 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe following tables present our major capital expenditures categories on an actual and pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, in accordance with National Cable and Telecommunications Association ( NCTA\u201d) disclosure guidelines for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The disclosure is intended to provide more consistency in the reporting of capital expenditures among peer companies in the cable industry. These disclosure guidelines are not required disclosures under GAAP, nor do they impact our accounting for capital expenditures under GAAP (dollars in millions):\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actual\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer premise equipment (a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Scalable infrastructure (b)\n</td> <td>1,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line extensions (c)\n</td> <td>721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>176\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Upgrade/rebuild (d)\n</td> <td>456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Support capital (e)\n</td> <td>894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures included in total related to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>242\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transition (f)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All-digital transition\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro Forma\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer premise equipment (a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Scalable infrastructure (b)\n</td> <td>2,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line extensions (c)\n</td> <td>1,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Upgrade/rebuild (d)\n</td> <td>610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Support capital (e)\n</td> <td>1,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Customer premise equipment includes costs incurred at the customer residence to secure new customers and revenue generating units.

fiber/coaxial cable networks, including betterments. \n (e) Support capital includes costs associated with the replacement or enhancement of non-network assets due to technological and physical obsolescence (e.g., non-network equipment, land, buildings and vehicles). \n (f) Transition represents incremental costs incurred to integrate the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House operations and to bring the three companies' systems and processes into a uniform operating structure. \nDebt\nAs of December 31, 2016, the accreted value of our total debt was approximately $61.7 billion, as

The agreements and instruments governing our debt and financing arrangements are complicated and you should consult such agreements and instruments which are filed with the SEC for more detailed information.\nAt December 31, 2016, Charter Operating had a consolidated leverage ratio of approximately 2.8 to 1.0 and a consolidated first lien leverage ratio of 2.7 to 1.0. Both ratios are in compliance with the ratios required by the Charter Operating credit facilities of 5.0 to 1.0 consolidated leverage ratio and 4.0 to 1.0 consolidated first lien leverage ratio. A failure by Charter Operating to maintain the financial covenants would result in an event of default under the Charter Operating credit facilities and the debt of CCO Holdings. See Part I. Item 1A.

In addition, the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of CCO Holdings, LLC and subsidiaries included in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are the second largest cable operator in the United States and a leading broadband communications services company providing video, Internet and voice services to approximately 26.2 million residential and business customers at December 31, 2016. In addition, we sell video and online advertising inventory to local, regional and national advertising customers and fiber-delivered communications and managed IT solutions to larger enterprise customers. We also own and operate regional sports networks and local sports, news and community channels and sell security and home management services to the residential marketplace. See Part I. Item 1. Business - Products and Services\u201d for further description of these services, including customer statistics for different services.\nSince 2012, Legacy Charter has actively invested in its network and operations and improved the quality and value of the products and packages that Legacy Charter offered. Through the roll-out of Spectrum pricing and packaging we have simplified our offers and improved our packaging of products, delivering more value to new and existing customers. Further, through the transition of our Legacy Charter markets to our all-digital platform, we increased our offerings to more than 200 HD channels in most of the Legacy Charter markets and offered Internet speeds of at least 60 or 100 Mbps, among other benefits. We believe that this product set combined with improved customer service, as we insource our workforce in our call centers and in our field operations, has led to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes.\nAs a result of the Transactions, 2016 revenues increased by over $18.6 billion year over year. We also saw an increase in expenses related to our increased scale. In September 2016, we began launching SPP to Legacy TWC markets and we expect that by mid 2017, we will offer SPP in all Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets. In 2017, we intend to begin converting the remaining Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House analog markets to an all-digital platform. Our corporate organization, as well as our marketing, sales and product development departments, are now centralized. Field operations are managed through eleven regional areas, each designed to represent a combination of designated marketing areas and managed with largely the same set of field employees that were with the three legacy companies prior to completion of the Transactions. Over a multi-year period, Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House customer care centers will migrate to Legacy Charter's model of using segmented, virtualized, U.S.-based in-house call centers. We will focus on deploying superior products and service with minimal service disruptions as we integrate our information technology and network operations. We expect customer and financial results to trend similar to Legacy Charter following the implementation of the Legacy Charter operating strategies across the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets. As a result of implementing our operating strategy at Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House, we cannot be certain that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates.\nThe Company realized revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations during the periods presented as follows (in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers. Minor differences may exist due to rounding).\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, net, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, other pension benefits, special charges and gain (loss) on sale or retirement of assets. See -Use of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow\u201d for further information on Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Growth in total revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and income from operations was primarily due to the Transactions.\nOn a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, total revenue growth was primarily due to growth in our Internet and commercial businesses. On a pro forma basis, Adjusted EBITDA growth was primarily due to an increase in residential and commercial revenues offset by increases in programming costs and other operating costs. In addition to the factors discussed above, income from operations on a pro forma basis was affected by increases in depreciation and amortization, merger and restructuring costs and stock compensation expense.\nApproximately 90%, 91% and 90% of our revenues for years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video, Internet, voice and commercial services provided by our cable systems. Generally, these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for certain commercial customers. The remaining 10%, 9% and 10% of revenue for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is derived primarily from advertising revenues, franchise and other regulatory fee revenues (which are collected by us but then\npaid to local authorities), pay-per-view and VOD programming, installation, processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service, and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services.\nWe incurred the following transition costs in connection with the Transactions (in millions).\n\nAmounts included in transition operating expenses and transition capital expenditures represent incremental costs incurred to integrate the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House operations and to bring the three companies' systems and processes into a uniform operating structure. Costs are incremental and would not be incurred absent the integration. Other operating expenses associated with the Transactions represent merger and restructuring costs and include advisory, legal and accounting fees, employee retention costs, employee termination costs and other exit costs.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCertain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. Management has discussed these policies with the Audit Committee of Charter's board of directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the following disclosure. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates, assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements, and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows:\n \u2022 Property, plant and equipment \n \u2022 Capitalization of labor and overhead costs \n \u2022 Valuation and impairment of property, plant and equipment \n \u2022 Useful lives of property, plant and equipment \n \u2022 Intangible assets \n \u2022 Valuation and impairment of franchises \n \u2022 Valuation and impairment of goodwill \n \u2022 Valuation and impairment and amortization of customer relationships \n \u2022 Income taxes \n \u2022 Litigation \n \u2022 Programming agreements \n \u2022 Pension plans \nIn addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimates or judgment that are not deemed critical, such as the allowance for doubtful accounts and valuations of our financial instruments, but changes in estimates or judgment in these other items could also have a material impact on our financial statements.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nThe cable industry is capital intensive, and a large portion of our resources are spent on capital activities associated with extending, rebuilding, and upgrading our cable network. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the net carrying amount of our property, plant and equipment (consisting primarily of cable distribution systems) was approximately $32.7 billion (representing 22% of total assets) and $8.3 billion (representing 48% of total assets), respectively. Total capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were approximately $5.3 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.\nCapitalization of labor and overhead costs. Costs associated with network construction, initial placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the initial placement of outlets within a dwelling along with the costs associated with the initial deployment of customer premise equipment necessary to provide video, Internet or voices services, are capitalized. Costs capitalized include materials, direct labor, and certain indirect costs. These indirect costs are associated with the activities of personnel who assist in installation activities, and consist of compensation and overhead costs associated with these support functions. While our capitalization is based on specific activities, once capitalized, we track these costs on a composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level, and not on a specific asset basis. For assets that are sold or retired, we remove the estimated applicable\ncost and accumulated depreciation. The costs of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from a dwelling and the costs to reconnect a customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expensed as incurred. Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred, while plant and equipment replacement, including replacement of certain components, betterments, and replacement of cable drops and outlets, are capitalized.\nWe make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized. We capitalize direct labor and overhead using standards developed from actual costs and applicable operational data. We calculate standards annually (or more frequently if circumstances dictate) for items such as the labor rates, overhead rates, and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity. For example, the standard amounts of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on studies of the time required to perform such activities. Overhead rates are established based on an analysis of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable activities, and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities. The impact of changes that resulted from these studies were not material in the periods presented.\nLabor costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized. Capitalizable activities performed in connection with installations include such activities as:\n \u2022 dispatching a truck roll\u201d to the customer's dwelling or business for service connection or placement of new equipment; \n \u2022 verification of serviceability to the customer's dwelling or business (i.e., determining whether the customer's dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network and/or receiving advanced or Internet services); \n \u2022 customer premise activities performed by in-house field technicians and third-party contractors in connection with customer installations, installation of equipment in connection with the installation of video, Internet or voice services, and equipment replacement and betterment; and \n \u2022 verifying the integrity of the customer's network connection by initiating test signals downstream from the headend to the customer's digital set-top box, as well as testing signal levels at the pole or pedestal. \nJudgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead costs incurred result from specific capital activities, and therefore should be capitalized. The primary costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are (i) employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor, (ii) direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities, (iii) the cost of support personnel, such as care personnel and dispatchers, who assist with capitalizable installation activities, and (iv) indirect costs directly attributable to capitalizable activities.\nWhile we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate, a significant change in the nature or extent of our system activities could affect management's judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future. We monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies, and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies. We capitalized direct labor and overhead of $991 million, $420 million and $427 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nValuation and impairment of property, plant and equipment. We evaluate the recoverability of our property, plant and equipment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors as the impairment of our indefinite life franchises, changes in technological advances, fluctuations in the fair value of such assets, adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities, adverse changes in market conditions, or a deterioration of current or expected future operating results. A long-lived asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset. No impairments of long-lived assets to be held and used were recorded in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nWe utilize the cost approach as the primary method used to establish fair value for our property, plant and equipment in connection with business combinations. The cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility, then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation and functional and economic obsolescence as of the appraisal date. The cost approach relies on management's assumptions regarding current material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of our property, plant and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of our property, plant and equipment.\nUseful lives of property, plant and equipment. We evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment, based on annual analysis of such useful lives, and revise such lives to the extent warranted by changing facts and circumstances. Any changes in estimated useful lives as a result of this analysis are reflected prospectively beginning in the period in which the study is completed. Our analysis of useful lives in 2016 did not indicate a change in useful lives. The effect of a one-year decrease in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment as of December 31,\n2016 would be an increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately $1.7 billion. The effect of a one-year increase in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2016 would be a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately $863 million.\nDepreciation expense related to property, plant and equipment totaled $5.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing approximately 20%, 21% and 22% of costs and expenses, respectively. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line composite method over management's estimate of the useful lives of the related assets as listed below:\n\nIntangible assets\nValuation and impairment of franchises. The net carrying value of franchises as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $67.3 billion (representing 45% of total assets) and $6.0 billion (representing 34% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. For more information and a complete discussion of how we value and test franchise assets for impairment, see Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWe perform an impairment assessment of franchise assets annually or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances. We performed a qualitative assessment in 2016. Our assessment included consideration of the fair value appraisals of Legacy Charter and the newly-acquired operations performed as of the date of acquisition for tax and acquisition accounting purposes, respectively, along with a multitude of factors that affect the fair value of our franchise assets. Examples of such factors include environmental and competitive changes within our operating footprint, actual and projected operating performance, the consistency of our operating margins, equity and debt market trends, including changes in our market capitalization, and changes in our regulatory and political landscape, among other factors. Based on our assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our franchise assets equals or exceeds their carrying values and that a quantitative impairment test is not required.\nThe appraisals indicated that the fair value of our franchise assets exceeded carrying value by approximately 25% in the aggregate, with the excess entirely attributable to the franchise assets of Legacy Charter to which acquisition accounting was not applied. At our unit of accounting level for franchise asset impairment testing, the amount by which fair value exceeds carrying value varies based on the extent to which the unit of accounting was comprised of newly-acquired operations. For units of accounting comprised entirely or substantially of newly-acquired operations, we believe the carrying value approximates the fair value given that there has been no significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates since the Transaction date. For units of accounting comprised of at least 25% Legacy Charter operations, the fair value exceeded carrying value by a range of 36% to 260%.\nValuation and impairment of goodwill. The net carrying value of goodwill as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $29.5 billion (representing 20% of total assets) and $1.2 billion (representing 7% of total assets), respectively. For more information and a complete discussion on how we test goodwill for impairment, see Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We perform our impairment assessment of goodwill annually as of November 30th. As with our franchise impairment testing, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill in 2016 which included the fair value appraisals and other factors described above. Based on the appraisals, we determined that the fair value of our goodwill exceeded carrying value by approximately 28% as of the closing of the Transactions. Given the limited amount of time between the closing of the Transactions and the completion of the assessment and absence of significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates, we concluded that it is more likely than not that our goodwill is not impaired.\nValuation, impairment and amortization of customer relationships. The net carrying value of customer relationships as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $14.6 billion (representing 10% of total assets) and $856 million (representing 5% of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents), respectively. Amortization expense related to customer relationships for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was approximately $1.9 billion, $249 million and $282\nmillion, respectively. No impairment of customer relationships was recorded in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. For more information and a complete discussion on our valuation methodology and amortization method, see Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nIncome taxes\nIn determining our tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be more likely than not\u201d of being sustained upon examination, based on their technical merits. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved. There is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the tax return are more likely than not\u201d of being sustained. We adjust our uncertain tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by, and settlements with, the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations.\nNo tax years for Charter, Charter Holdings or Charter Holdco, our indirect parent companies, for income tax purposes, are currently under examination by the IRS. Charter and Charter Holdings' 2016 tax year remains open for assessment. Legacy Charter's tax years ending 2013 through the short period return dated May 17, 2016 remain subject to examination and assessment. Years prior to 2013 remain open solely for purposes of examination of Legacy Charter's loss and credit carryforwards. The IRS is currently examining Legacy TWC's income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. Legacy TWC's tax years ending 2013 through 2015 remain subject to examination and assessment. Prior to Legacy TWC's separation from Time Warner Inc. ( Time Warner\u201d) in March 2009 (the Separation\u201d), Legacy TWC was included in the consolidated U.S. federal and certain state income tax returns of Time Warner. The IRS is currently examining Time Warner's 2008 through 2010 income tax returns. Time Warner's income tax returns for 2005 to 2007, which are periods prior to the separation, were settled with the exception of an immaterial item that has been referred to the IRS Appeals Division. We have unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest and penalties, totaling approximately $159 million as of December 31, 2016.\nLitigation\nLegal contingencies have a high degree of uncertainty. When a loss from a contingency becomes estimable and probable, a reserve is established. The reserve reflects management's best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised as facts and circumstances change. A reserve is released when a matter is ultimately brought to closure or the statute of limitations lapses. We have established reserves for certain matters. Although these matters are not expected individually to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, such matters could have, in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nProgramming agreements\nWe exercise significant judgment in estimating programming expense associated with certain video programming contracts. Our policy is to record video programming costs based on our contractual agreements with our programming vendors, which are generally multi-year agreements that provide for us to make payments to the programming vendors at agreed upon market rates based on the number of customers to which we provide the programming service. If a programming contract expires prior to the parties' entry into a new agreement and we continue to distribute the service, we estimate the programming costs during the period there is no contract in place. In doing so, we consider the previous contractual rates, inflation and the status of the negotiations in determining our estimates. When the programming contract terms are finalized, an adjustment to programming expense is recorded, if necessary, to reflect the terms of the new contract. We also make estimates in the recognition of programming expense related to other items, such as the accounting for free periods, timing of rate increases and credits from service interruptions, as well as the allocation of consideration exchanged between the parties in multiple-element transactions.\nSignificant judgment is also involved when we enter into agreements that result in us receiving cash consideration from the programming vendor, usually in the form of advertising sales, channel positioning fees, launch support or marketing support. In these situations, we must determine based upon facts and circumstances if such cash consideration should be recorded as revenue, a reduction in programming expense or a reduction in another expense category (e.g., marketing).\nPension plans\nUpon completion of the TWC Transaction, we assumed Legacy TWC's pension plans. We sponsor two qualified defined benefit pension plans, the TWC Pension Plan and the TWC Union Pension Plan (collectively, the TWC Pension Plans\u201d), that provide\npension benefits to a majority of Legacy TWC employees. We also provide a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain employees under the TWC Excess Pension Plan. As of December 31, 2016, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the TWC Pension Plans was $3.3 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, and the net underfunded liability of the TWC Pension Plans was recorded as a $1 million noncurrent asset, $6 million current liability and $309 million long-term liability.\nPension benefits are based on formulas that reflect the employees' years of service and compensation during their employment period. Actuarial gains or losses are changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions. We have elected to follow a mark-to-market pension accounting policy for recording the actuarial gains or losses annually during the fourth quarter, or earlier if a remeasurement event occurs during an interim period. We use a December 31 measurement date for our pension plans.\nWe recognized a net periodic pension benefit of $813 million in 2016. Net periodic pension benefit or expense is determined using certain assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate and expected rate of compensation increases. We determined the discount rate used to compute pension expense based on the yield of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds with cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future defined benefit payments. In developing the expected long-term rate of return on assets, we considered the current pension portfolio's composition, past average rate of earnings, and our asset allocation targets. We used a discount rate of 3.99% from the date of the Transaction to June 30, 2016, and 3.72% from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 to compute 2016 pension expense. A decrease in the discount rate of 25 basis points would result in a $154 million increase in our pension plan benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016 and net periodic pension expense recognized in 2016 under our mark-to-market accounting policy. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to compute 2016 pension expense was 6.50%. A decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of 25 basis points, from 6.50% to 6.25%, while holding all other assumptions constant, would result in an increase in our 2017 net periodic pension expense of approximately $7 million. See Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional discussion on these assumptions.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share data):\n\nRevenues. Total revenues grew $19.2 billion or 197% in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 and grew $646 million or 7.1% in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. Revenue growth primarily reflects the Transactions\nand increases in the number of residential Internet and triple play customers and in commercial business customers, growth in rates driven by higher equipment revenue and rate increases offset by a decrease in basic video customers. The Transactions increased revenues for year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 by approximately $18.6 billion. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, total revenue growth was 7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015.\nRevenues by service offering were as follows (dollars in millions; all percentages are calculated using whole numbers. Minor differences may exist due to rounding):\n\nVideo revenues consist primarily of revenues from basic and digital video services provided to our residential customers, as well as franchise fees, equipment rental and video installation revenue. Excluding the impacts of the Transactions, residential video customers increased by 42,000 in 2016 and decreased by 2,000 in 2015. The increases in video revenues are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n\nOn a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, residential video customers decreased by 226,000 in 2016 and the increase in video revenues is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n\nExcluding the impacts of the Transactions, residential Internet customers grew by 461,000 and 442,000 customers in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increases in Internet revenues from our residential customers are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n\nOn a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, residential Internet customers increased by 1,463,000 in 2016 and the increase in Internet revenues is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n\nExcluding the impacts of the Transactions, residential voice customers grew by 95,000 and 159,000 customers in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change in voice revenues from our residential customers is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n\nOn a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, residential voice customers increased by 368,000 in 2016 and the increase in voice revenues is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n\nExcluding the impacts of the Transactions, small and medium business PSUs increased 128,000 and 109,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increases in small and medium business commercial revenues are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n\nOn a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, small and medium business PSUs increased by 291,000 in 2016 and the increase in small and medium business commercial revenues is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n\nExcluding the impacts of the Transactions, enterprise PSUs increased 6,000 and 5,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, enterprise PSUs increased by 16,000 in 2016. The Transactions increased enterprise commercial revenues for year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 by approximately $1.0 billion. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, enterprise commercial revenues increased $207 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to growth in customers.\nAdvertising sales revenues consist primarily of revenues from commercial advertising customers, programmers and other vendors, as well as local cable and advertising on regional sports and news channels. Advertising sales revenues increased in 2016 primarily due to the Transactions and decreased in 2015 primarily as a result of a decrease in political advertising. The Transactions increased advertising sales revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 by $898 million. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, advertising sales revenues increased $172 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to an increase in political advertising.\nOther revenues consist of revenue from regional sports and news channels (excluding intercompany charges or advertising sales on those channels), home shopping, late payment fees, wire maintenance fees and other miscellaneous revenues. The increase in 2016 was primarily due to the Transactions. The Transactions increased other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 by $429 million. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, other revenues increased $33 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a settlement related to an early contract termination.\nOperating costs and expenses. The increases in our operating costs and expenses are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n\nProgramming costs were approximately $7.0 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion, representing 38%, 42% and 41% of operating costs and expenses for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in operating costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the Transactions.\nThe increase in other expense is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n\nThe increases in other expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the corresponding prior periods were primarily due to the Transactions.\nOn a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, increases in our operating costs and expenses, exclusive of items shown separately in the consolidated statements of operations, are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n\nOn a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, programming costs were approximately $9.6 billion and $9.0 billion, representing 37% and 36% of total operating costs and expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nProgramming costs consist primarily of costs paid to programmers for basic, digital, premium, VOD, and pay-per-view programming. The increase in pro forma programming costs is primarily a result of annual contractual rate adjustments, including increases in amounts paid for retransmission consents and the introduction of new networks offset by synergies as a result of the Transactions and lower pay-per-view programming expenses. We expect pro forma programming expenses will continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media consolidation, increased demands by owners of broadcast stations for payment for retransmission consent or linking carriage of other services to retransmission consent, and additional programming, particularly new services. We have been unable to fully pass these increases on to our customers nor do we expect to be able to do so in the future without a potential loss of customers.\nOn a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, the increase in other expense is attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n\nThe increase in advertising sales expense relates primarily to higher advertising sales revenue. The increase in corporate costs relates primarily to increases in the number of employees including increases in engineering and IT. Stock compensation expense increased primarily due to increases in headcount and the value of equity issued.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $4.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily as a result of additional depreciation and amortization related to the Transactions, inclusive of the incremental amounts as a result of the higher fair values recorded in acquisition accounting. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $23 million in 2015 compared to 2014 which primarily represents depreciation on more recent capital expenditures offset by certain assets becoming fully depreciated.\nOther operating expenses, net. The changes in other operating expenses, net are attributable to the following (dollars in millions):\n\nThe increase in merger and restructuring costs is primarily due to approximately $642 million of employee retention and employee termination costs incurred during 2016. Other pension benefits includes the pension curtailment gain of $675 million, remeasurement gain of $195 million, expected return on plan assets of $116 million offset by interest costs of $87 million. For more information, see Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nInterest expense, net. Net interest expense increased by $1.3 billion in 2016 from 2015 and decreased by $49 million in 2015 from 2014. The increase in 2016 as compared to 2015 is primarily due to $594 million of interest expense associated with the debt incurred to fund the Transactions in 2016 as well as $604 million associated with debt assumed from Legacy TWC. Net interest expense decreased in 2015 compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily as a result of a decrease in interest rates.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt of $111 million and $126 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily represents losses recognized as a result of the repurchase of CCO Holdings notes. For more information, see Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nGain (loss) on financial instruments, net. Interest rate derivative instruments are used to manage our interest costs and to reduce our exposure to increases in floating interest rates, and cross-currency derivative instruments are used to manage foreign exchange risk related to the foreign currency denominated debt assumed in the TWC Transaction. We recorded gains of $89 million and losses of $4 million and $7 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Gains and losses on financial instruments are recognized due to changes in the fair value of our interest rate and, in 2016 our cross currency derivative instruments and the remeasurement of the fixed-rate British pound sterling denominated notes (the Sterling Notes\u201d) into U.S. dollars. The year ended December 31, 2016 also includes an $11 million loss realized upon termination of Legacy TWC interest rate swap derivative instruments. For more information, see Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nOther expense, net. Other expense, net primarily represents equity losses on our equity-method investments. For more information, see Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nIncome tax benefit (expense). We recognized income tax expense of $3 million and $13 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014 and income tax benefit of $210 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The income tax benefit in 2015 was primarily due to the deemed liquidation of Charter Holdco solely for federal and state income tax purposes offset by income tax expense recognized primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities. Income tax expense was recognized in 2016 and 2014 primarily through increases in deferred tax liabilities, as well as through current federal and state income tax expense. The tax provision in future periods will vary based on current and future temporary differences, as well as future operating results. For more information, see Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2016 relates to our third-party interest in CV of Viera, LLP, a consolidated joint venture in a small cable system in Florida assumed in the Transactions. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in 2015 and 2014 included the 2% accretion of the preferred membership interests in CC VIII, LLC ( CC VIII\u201d) plus approximately 18.6% of CC VIII's income, net of accretion. On December 31, 2015, the CC VIII preferred interest held by CCH I, LLC was contributed to CC VIII and subsequently canceled. For more information, see Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Item 1. Financial Statements.\u201d\nNet income attributable to CCO Holdings member. Net income attributable to CCO Holdings member was $1.5 billion, $308 million and $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily as a result of the factors described above. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, net income attributable to CCO Holdings member was $1.9 billion and $608 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nUse of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow\nWe use certain measures that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) to evaluate various aspects of our business. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, consolidated net income and net cash flows from operating activities reported in accordance with GAAP. These terms, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are reconciled to consolidated net income and net cash flows from operating activities, respectively, below.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, (gain) loss on financial instruments, other (income) expense, net and other operating (income) expenses, such as merger and restructuring costs, other pension benefits, special charges and (gain) loss on sale or retirement of assets. As such, it eliminates the significant non-cash depreciation and amortization expense that results from the capital-intensive nature of our businesses as well as other non-cash or special items, and is unaffected by our capital structure or investment activities. However, this measure is limited in that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues and our cash cost of financing. These costs are evaluated through other financial measures.\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures and changes in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow provide information useful to investors in assessing our performance and our ability to service our debt, fund operations and make additional investments with internally generated funds. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA generally correlates to the leverage ratio calculation under our credit facilities or outstanding notes to determine compliance with the covenants contained in the facilities and notes (all such documents have been previously filed with the SEC). For the purpose of calculating compliance with leverage covenants, we use Adjusted EBITDA, as presented, excluding certain expenses paid by our operating subsidiaries to other Charter entities. Our debt covenants refer to these expenses as management fees, which fees were in the amount of $930 million, $322 million and $253 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe have significant amounts of debt. The principal amount of our debt as of December 31, 2016 was $60.0 billion, consisting of $8.9 billion of credit facility debt, $37.7 billion of investment grade senior secured notes and $13.4 billion of high-yield senior unsecured notes. Our business requires significant cash to fund principal and interest payments on our debt.\nOur projected cash needs and projected sources of liquidity depend upon, among other things, our actual results, and the timing and amount of our expenditures. Free cash flow was $4.0 billion, $745 million and $196 million for the years ended December 31,\n2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the amount available under our credit facilities was approximately $2.8 billion and cash on hand was approximately $1.3 billion. We expect to utilize free cash flow, cash on hand and availability under our credit facilities as well as future refinancing transactions to further extend the maturities of or reduce the principal on our obligations. The timing and terms of any refinancing transactions will be subject to market conditions. Additionally, we may, from time to time, and depending on market conditions and other factors, use cash on hand and the proceeds from securities offerings or other borrowings to retire our debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, tender offers or redemption provisions. We believe we have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, free cash flow and Charter Operating's revolving credit facility as well as access to the capital markets to fund our projected cash needs.\nWe continue to evaluate the deployment of our cash on hand and anticipated future free cash flow including to invest in our business growth and other strategic opportunities, including mergers and acquisitions as well as distributions to our parent company for stock repurchases and dividends. Charter's target leverage remains at 4 to 4.5 times, and up to 3.5 times at the Charter Operating level. In 2016, Charter purchased approximately 5.1 million shares of its Class A common stock for approximately $1.3 billion pursuant to authorizations by Charter's board of directors of $3 billion. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2016 and provided Charter's and Charter Operating's leverage ratios remain at target, management has authority to cause Charter to purchase an additional $1.7 billion of Charter's Class A common stock without taking into account shares or units that may be purchased from A/N. Effective November 1, 2016, Charter's board of directors granted authority for a new $750 million of Class A common stock buybacks under the rolling six-month authority without taking into account any Class A common stock purchased prior to November 1. As a result, a portion of the $1.7 billion of authority is under the authority of management to approve up to $750 million for Class A common stock buybacks in any six-month period. Charter is not obligated to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and the timing of any purchases that may occur cannot be predicted and will largely depend on market conditions and other potential uses of capital. Purchases may include open market purchases or negotiated transactions. To the extent such purchases occur, CCO Holdings would likely be required to fund such purchases through distributions to our parent company. As possible acquisitions, swaps or dispositions arise, we actively review them against our objectives including, among other considerations, improving the operational efficiency, clustering, product development or technology capabilities of our business and achieving appropriate return targets, and we may participate to the extent we believe these possibilities present attractive opportunities. However, there can be no assurance that we will actually complete any acquisitions, dispositions or system swaps, or that any such transactions will be material to our operations or results.\nIn December 2016, Charter and A/N exchanged 1.9 million Charter Holdings common units held by A/N for shares of Charter Class A common stock pursuant to the Letter Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $537 million. The Letter Agreement also requires A/N to sell to Charter or to Charter Holdings, on a monthly basis, a number of shares of Charter Class A common stock or Charter Holdings common units that represents a pro rata participation by A/N and its affiliates in any repurchases of shares of Charter Class A common stock from persons other than A/N effected by Charter during the immediately preceding calendar month, at a purchase price equal to the average price paid by Charter for the shares repurchased from persons other than A/N during such immediately preceding calendar month. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, Charter Holdings purchased from A/N 752,767 Charter Holdings common units at a price per unit of $289.83, or $218 million.\nRecent Events\nIn January 2017, Charter Operating entered into an amendment to its Credit Agreement decreasing the applicable LIBOR margin on both the term loan E and term loan F to 2.00% and eliminating the LIBOR floor.\nIn February 2017, CCO Holdings and CCO Holdings Capital Corp. closed on transactions in which they issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2027. The net proceeds were used to redeem CCO Holdings' 6.625% senior notes due 2022, pay related fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow increased $3.3 billion and $549 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the corresponding prior periods, respectively, due to the following.\n\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our payment obligations as of December 31, 2016 under our long-term debt and certain other contractual obligations and commitments inclusive of parent company obligations and commitments, the expense of which are pushed down to us (dollars in millions.)\n\n (a) The table presents maturities of long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2016. Refer to Notes 9 and 18 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a description of our long-term debt and other contractual obligations and commitments. \n (b) Interest payments on variable debt are estimated using amounts outstanding at December 31, 2016 and the average implied forward London Interbank Offering Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) rates applicable for the quarter during the interest rate reset based on the yield curve in effect at December 31, 2016. Actual interest payments will differ based on actual LIBOR rates and actual amounts outstanding for applicable periods. \n (c) We lease certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable capital and operating leases. Leases and rental costs charged to expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were $215 million, $49 million and $43 million, respectively. \n (d) We pay programming fees under multi-year contracts typically based on a flat fee per customer, which may be fixed for the term, or may in some cases escalate over the term. Programming costs included in the accompanying statement of operations were approximately $7.0 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Certain of our programming agreements are based on a flat fee per month or have guaranteed minimum payments. The table sets forth the aggregate guaranteed minimum commitments under our programming contracts. \n (e) Other\u201d represents other guaranteed minimum commitments, including rights negotiated directly with content owners for distribution on company-owned channels or networks and commitments related to our role as an advertising and distribution sales agent for third party-owned channels or networks as well as commitments to our customer premise equipment vendors. \nThe following items are not included in the contractual obligations table because the obligations are not fixed and/or determinable due to various factors discussed below. However, we incur these costs as part of our operations:\n \u2022 We rent utility poles used in our operations. Generally, pole rentals are cancelable on short notice, but we anticipate that such rentals will recur. Rent expense incurred for pole rental attachments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $115 million, $53 million and $49 million, respectively. \n \u2022 We pay franchise fees under multi-year franchise agreements based on a percentage of revenues generated from video service per year. We also pay other franchise related costs, such as public education grants, under multi-year agreements. Franchise fees and other franchise-related costs included in the accompanying statement of operations were $534 million, $212 million and $208 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n \u2022 We also have $278 million in letters of credit, of which $220 million is secured under the Charter Operating credit facility, primarily to our various casualty carriers as collateral for reimbursement of workers' compensation, auto liability and general liability claims. \n \u2022 Minimum pension funding requirements have not been presented in the table above as such amounts have not been determined beyond 2016. We made no cash contributions to the qualified pension plans in 2016; however, we are permitted to make discretionary cash contributions to the qualified pension plans in 2017. For the nonqualified pension plan, we contributed $5 million during 2016 and will continue to make contributions in 2017 to the extent benefits are paid. \nSee \"Part I. Item 1. Business - Transaction-Related Commitments\" for a listing of commitments as a result of the Transactions.\nHistorical Operating, Investing, and Financing Activities\nCash and Cash Equivalents. We held $1.3 billion and $5 million in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $6.2 billion during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $7.2 billion offset by an increase in cash paid for interest, net of $1.4 billion.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $173 million from $2.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of $216 million offset by a $32 million increase in merger and acquisition costs.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $4.8 billion and net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.7 billion. The increase in cash used was primarily due to the repayment in 2015 of $3.5 billion of net proceeds held in escrow upon the termination of the proposed transactions with Comcast as well as an increase in capital expenditures of $3.5 billion.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1.7 billion and net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $5.7 billion. The increase in cash provided in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due a decrease in long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents upon repayment of the Term G Loans out of escrow related to the proposed transactions with Comcast and a decrease in capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $2.7 billion and $4.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net cash provided in financing activities was $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in cash used in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the repayment in 2015 of $3.5 billion of net proceeds\nheld in escrow upon the termination of the proposed transactions with Comcast.\nThe increase in cash used during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2014 was primarily the result of the repayment of $3.5 billion of net proceeds held in escrow related to the Term G Loans upon the termination of the Comcast Transactions.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe have significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements. Capital expenditures were $5.3 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase was driven by the Transactions. On a pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, the increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared\nto the corresponding prior period was driven by higher product development investments, transition capital expenditures incurred in connection with the Transactions and support capital investments. See the table below for more details.\nThe actual amount of our capital expenditures in 2017 will depend on a number of factors, including the pace of transition planning to service a larger customer base as a result of the Transactions, our all-digital transition in the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House markets and growth rates of both our residential and commercial businesses.\nOur capital expenditures are funded primarily from cash flows from operating activities and borrowings on our credit facility. In addition, our liabilities related to capital expenditures increased by $603 million, $28 million and $33 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe following tables present our major capital expenditures categories on an actual and pro forma basis, assuming the Transactions occurred as of January 1, 2015, in accordance with National Cable and Telecommunications Association ( NCTA\u201d) disclosure guidelines for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The disclosure is intended to provide more consistency in the reporting of capital expenditures among peer companies in the cable industry. These disclosure guidelines are not required disclosures under GAAP, nor do they impact our accounting for capital expenditures under GAAP (dollars in millions):\n\n (a) Customer premise equipment includes costs incurred at the customer residence to secure new customers and revenue generating units. It also includes customer installation costs and customer premise equipment (e.g., set-top boxes and cable modems). \n (b) Scalable infrastructure includes costs not related to customer premise equipment, to secure growth of new customers and revenue generating units, or provide service enhancements (e.g., headend equipment). \n (c) Line extensions include network costs associated with entering new service areas (e.g., fiber/coaxial cable, amplifiers, electronic equipment, make-ready and design engineering). \n (d) Upgrade/rebuild includes costs to modify or replace existing fiber/coaxial cable networks, including betterments. \n (e) Support capital includes costs associated with the replacement or enhancement of non-network assets due to technological and physical obsolescence (e.g., non-network equipment, land, buildings and vehicles). \n (f) Transition represents incremental costs incurred to integrate the Legacy TWC and Legacy Bright House operations and to bring the three companies' systems and processes into a uniform operating structure. \nDebt\nAs of December 31, 2016, the accreted value of our total debt was approximately $61.7 billion, as summarized below (dollars in millions):\n\n (a) The accreted values presented in the table above represent the principal amount of the debt less the original issue discount at the time of sale, deferred financing costs, and, (i) in regards to the Legacy TWC debt assumed, a fair value premium adjustment as a result of applying acquisition accounting plus/minus the accretion of those amounts to the balance sheet date and (ii) in regards to the fixed-rate British pound sterling denominated notes (the Sterling Notes\u201d), a remeasurement of the principal amount of the debt and any premium or discount into US dollars as of the balance sheet date. However, the amount that is currently payable if the debt becomes immediately due is equal to the principal amount of the debt. We have availability under our credit facilities of approximately $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2016. \n (b) In general, the obligors have the right to redeem all of the notes set forth in the above table in whole or in part at their option, beginning at various times prior to their stated maturity dates, subject to certain conditions, upon the payment of the outstanding principal amount (plus a specified redemption premium) and all accrued and unpaid interest. For additional information see Description of our Outstanding Debt\u201d below. \n (c) Principal amount includes \u00a3625 million valued at $770 million as of December 31, 2016 using the exchange rate as of December 31, 2016. \n (d) Principal amount includes \u00a3650 million valued at $800 million as of December 31, 2016 using the exchange rate aas of December 31, 2016. \nSee Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further details regarding our outstanding debt and other financing arrangements, including certain information about maturities, covenants and restrictions related to such debt and financing arrangements. The agreements and instruments governing our debt and financing arrangements are complicated and you should consult such agreements and instruments which are filed with the SEC for more detailed information.\nAt December 31, 2016, Charter Operating had a consolidated leverage ratio of approximately 2.8 to 1.0 and a consolidated first lien leverage ratio of 2.7 to 1.0. Both ratios are in compliance with the ratios required by the Charter Operating credit facilities of 5.0 to 1.0 consolidated leverage ratio and 4.0 to 1.0 consolidated first lien leverage ratio. A failure by Charter Operating to maintain the financial covenants would result in an event of default under the Charter Operating credit facilities and the debt of CCO Holdings. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors - The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity.\u201d\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 20 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II.

subsidiaries details the company's financial position and performance for the 2016 fiscal year, referring to audited consolidated financial statements and notes. \n\nAs the second-largest cable operator in the United States, the company provides broadband communication services to over 26 million residential and business customers, including video, internet, and voice services, as well as advertising and IT solutions. Significant investments have been made in network enhancements, improved quality of products, and customer service, resulting in reduced customer churn and increased customer lifetimes.\n\nThe report highlights significant financial and operational increases in 2016 compared to 2015, mainly due to strategic transactions (referred to as \"the Transactions\"), which drove revenues up by over $18.6 billion. The increased scale also brought higher expenses. Throughout 2016, efforts were made to transition Legacy Time Warner Cable (TWC) and Legacy Bright House markets to the Spectrum pricing and packaging and an all-digital platform. This included expanding offerings and centralizing corporate operations.\n\nRevenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and income from operations saw considerable increases in 2016. Revenue grew by 197.3% over 2015 and 7.1% over 2014. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 210.5% over 2015 and 6.8% over 2014. Income from operations increased by 223.9% over 2015 and 14.7% over 2014. However, these dramatic increases were primarily due to the Transactions, particularly the acquisitions completed during the year.\n\nA pro forma analysis, assuming the Transactions occurred at the beginning of 2015, shows that on a pro forma basis, revenue, Adjusted EBITDA, and income from operations still showed growth, albeit at lower percentages.\n\nKey financial metrics are laid out, primarily revenue streams which are, for the most part, related to subscription fees. Transition costs associated with the Transactions are also detailed, as these represent significant investments to integrate operations and unify the companies' systems and processes.\n\nThe discussion also addresses critical accounting policies and estimates, highlighting the areas where management must make complex judgments, particularly regarding property and equipment valuation, impairment, and lifespan, as well as intangible assets, income taxes, litigation, programming agreements, and pension plans.\n\nThe report includes a detailed presentation of revenue growth across various service offerings, categorized as video, internet, voice, commercial, advertising sales, and other revenue. Several tables included in the report provide a detailed breakdown of financial performance and comparisons on an actual and pro forma basis.\n\nThere is an elaborate explanation of cash flow, showing a substantial increase in free cash flow and a thorough breakdown of all the obligations, such as long-term debt principal and interest payments, lease obligations, and programming minimum commitments. Significant capital expenditure requirements for network infrastructure, customer premises equipment, and support are noted; these are essential for business growth and improvement of services.\n\nFinally, the liquidity and capital resources overview mention the high levels of debt the company maintains and its strategies to manage this debt, including refinancing options and managing free cash flow, with discussions about potential uses of cash, including investment in the business, mergers, acquisitions, and stock repurchases. The company's credit facilities, debt maturity profile, and compliance with financial covenants are also addressed."}
