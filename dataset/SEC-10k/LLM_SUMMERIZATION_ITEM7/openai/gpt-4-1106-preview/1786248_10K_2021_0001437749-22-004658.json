Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. The following should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected, forecasted, or expected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report. Our management believes the assumptions underlying the Company's financial statements and accompanying notes are reasonable. However, the Company's financial statements and accompanying notes may not be an indication of our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial mortgage REIT incorporated in Maryland on June 7, 2019. Our strategy is to originate, structure and invest in first-lien mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, convertible notes, multifamily properties and common stock investments, as well as multifamily CMBS securitizations. We primarily focus on investments in real estate sectors where our senior management team has operating expertise, including in the multifamily, SFR, self-storage, life science, hospitality and office sectors predominantly in the top 50 MSAs. In addition, we target lending or investing in properties that are stabilized or have a light-transitional business plan.\nOur investment objective is to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns for stockholders over the long term. We seek to employ a flexible and relative-value focused investment strategy and expect to re-allocate capital periodically among our target investment classes. We believe this flexibility will enable us to efficiently manage risk and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns under a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. For highlights of our acquisition, financing and other activity during 2021, see Item 1. Business-2021 Highlights.\u201d Our business continues to be subject to the uncertainties associated with COVID-19. For additional information, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risk Factors Related to our Business-The current COVID-19 pandemic and the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases could materially and adversely impact or disrupt our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance.\u201d\nWe are externally managed by our Manager, a subsidiary of our Sponsor, an SEC-registered investment advisor, which has extensive real estate experience, having completed as of December 31, 2021 approximately $15.0 billion of gross real estate transactions since the beginning of 2012. In addition, our Sponsor, together with its affiliates, including NexBank, is one of the most experienced global alternative credit managers managing approximately $14.7 billion of loans and debt or credit related investments as of December 31, 2021 and has managed credit investments for over 25 years. We believe our relationship with our Sponsor benefits us by providing access to resources including research capabilities, an extensive relationship network, other proprietary information, scalability, and a vast wealth of knowledge of information on real estate in our target assets and sectors.\nWe elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2020. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain one or more exclusions or exemptions from registration under the Investment Company Act.\nOn October 15, 2021, a lawsuit was filed by a trust set up in connection with the Highland bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. The lawsuit makes claims against a number of entities, including our Sponsor and James Dondero. The lawsuit does not include claims related to our business or our assets or operations. Our Sponsor and Mr. Dondero have informed us they believe the lawsuit has no merit and they intend to vigorously defend against the claims. We do not expect the lawsuit will have a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nComponents of Our Revenues and Expenses\nNet Interest Income\nInterest income. Our earnings are primarily attributable to the interest income from mortgage loans, mezzanine loan and preferred equity investments. Loan premium/discount amortization and prepayment penalties are also included as components of interest income.\nInterest expense. Interest expense represents interest accrued on our various financing obligations used to fund our investments and is shown as a deduction to arrive at net interest income.\nThe following table presents the components of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 192: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended

Includes unrealized gain (loss) based on changes in the fair value of the CMBS I/O Strips. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nChange in unrealized gain on common stock investment held at fair value. Includes unrealized gain (loss) based on changes in the fair value of our common stock investment in NSP. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nLoan loss benefit (provision). Loan loss benefit (provision) represents the change in our allowance for loan losses. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDividend income. Dividend income represents the accrued interest income and quarterly cash and stock dividends earned on our preferred stock investment in Jernigan Capital, Inc. ( JCAP\u201d).\nRealized losses. Realized losses include the excess, or deficiency, of net proceeds received, less the carrying value of such investments, as realized losses. The Company reverses cumulative unrealized gains or losses previously reported in its Consolidated Statements of Operations with respect to the investment sold at the time of the sale.\nOther income. Includes placement fees, exit fees and other miscellaneous income items.\nOperating Expenses\nG&A expenses. G&A expenses include, but are not limited to, audit fees, legal fees, listing fees, Board fees, equity-based and other compensation expenses, investor-relations costs and payments of reimbursements to our Manager. The Manager will be reimbursed for expenses it incurs on behalf of the Company. However, our Manager is responsible, and we will not reimburse our Manager or its affiliates, for the salaries or benefits to be paid to personnel of our Manager or its affiliates who serve as our officers, except that 50% of the salary of our VP of Finance is allocated to us and we may grant equity awards to our officers under the NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. 2020 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 2020 LTIP\u201d). Direct payment of operating expenses by us, which includes compensation expense relating to equity awards granted under the 2020 LTIP, together with reimbursement of operating expenses to our Manager, plus the Annual Fee, may not exceed 2.5% of equity book value determined in accordance with GAAP, for any calendar year or portion thereof, provided, however, that this limitation will not apply to Offering Expenses, legal, accounting, financial, due diligence and other service fees incurred in connection with extraordinary litigation and mergers and acquisitions and other events outside the ordinary course of our business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of certain real estate related investments. To the extent total corporate G&A expenses would otherwise exceed 2.5% of equity book value, our Manager will waive all or a portion of its Annual Fee to keep our total corporate G&A expenses at or below 2.5% of equity book value.\nLoan servicing fees. We pay various service providers fees for loan servicing of our SFR Loans, mezzanine loans and consolidated CMBS trusts. We classify the expenses related to the administration of the SFR Loans and mezzanine loans as servicing fees while the fees associated with the CMBS trusts are included as a component of the change in net assets related to consolidated CMBS variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d).\nManagement fees. Management fees include fees paid to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 196: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,846 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,248 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,598 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (income) attributable to preferred shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,508 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,748 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,760 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (income) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40,387 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,323 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,064 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>256.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nThe change in our net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily relates to increases in net interest income and other income including changes in net assets related to consolidated CMBS VIEs partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Our net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately $39.6 million. We earned approximately $26.1 million in net interest income, $71.3 million in other income, incurred operating expenses of $13.8 million, allocated $3.5 million of income to preferred stockholders and allocated $40.4 million of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nRevenues\nNet interest income. Net interest income was $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was an increase of approximately $8.4 million. The increase between the periods is primarily due to an increase in investments and the number of days in operation compared to the prior period. Additionally, prepayment penalties related to early paydowns offset by accelerated premium amortization contribute to the increase between the periods. As of December 31, 2021 we own 74 discrete investments compared to 60 as of December 31, 2020.\nOther income. Other income was $71.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was an increase of approximately $45.5 million. This was primarily due to an increase in net assets related to consolidated CMBS VIEs and an increase in fair value marks between the periods.\nExpenses\nG&A expenses. G&A expenses were $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was an increase of approximately $3.0 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in stock compensation expense and a $0.8 million increase in legal fees compared to the prior period.\nLoan servicing fees. Loan servicing fees were $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was an increase of approximately $0.9 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to an increase in loans in the portfolio and the number of days in operation compared to the prior period.\nManagement fees. Management fees were $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was an increase of approximately $0.7 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to an increase in equity as defined by the Management Agreement and the number of days in operation compared to the prior period.\nKey Financial Measures and Indicators\nAs a real estate finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are earnings per share, dividends declared, EAD, CAD and book value per share.\nEarnings Per Share and Dividends Declared\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share and dividends declared per share (in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 197: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,323 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,099 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,206 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,648 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income per share, basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income per share, diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.74 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends declared per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.9000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.4198 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nEarnings Available for Distribution and Cash Available for Distribution\nEAD is a non-GAAP financial measure. EAD has replaced our prior presentation of Core Earnings. In addition, Core Earnings results from prior reporting periods have been relabeled EAD. In line with evolving industry practices, we believe EAD more accurately reflects the principal purpose of the measure than the term Core Earnings and will serve as a useful indicator for investors in evaluating our performance and our long-term ability to pay distributions. EAD is defined as the net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, including realized gains and losses not otherwise included in net income (loss), excluding any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income (loss) for the applicable reporting period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income (loss), or in net income (loss) and adding back amortization of stock-based compensation.\nWe use EAD to evaluate our performance which excludes the effects of certain GAAP adjustments and transactions that we believe are not indicative of our current operations and to assess our long-term ability to pay distributions. We believe providing EAD as a supplement to GAAP net income (loss) to our investors is helpful to their assessment of our performance and our long term ability to pay distributions. EAD does not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operating activities, a measure of our liquidity or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. Our computation of EAD may not be comparable to EAD reported by other REITs.\nWe also use EAD as a component of the management fee paid to our Manager. As consideration for the Manager's services, we will pay our Manager an annual management fee of 1.5% of Equity, paid monthly, in cash or shares of our common stock at the election of our Manager. Equity\u201d means (a) the sum of (1) total stockholders' equity immediately prior to our IPO, plus (2) the net proceeds received from all issuances of our equity securities in and after the IPO, plus (3) our cumulative EAD from and after the IPO to the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter, (b) less (1) any distributions to our holders of common stock from and after the IPO to the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter and (2) all amounts that we have paid to repurchase for cash the shares of our equity securities from and after the IPO to the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter. In our calculation of Equity, we will adjust our calculation of EAD to (i) remove the compensation expense relating to awards granted under one or more of our long-term incentive plans that is added back in our calculation of EAD and (ii) adjust net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for (x) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and (y) certain material non-cash income or expense items, in each case of (x) and (y) after discussions between the Manager and independent directors of our Board and approved by a majority of the independent directors of our Board. Additionally, for the avoidance of doubt, Equity does not include the assets contributed to us in the Formation Transaction.\nCAD is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate CAD by adjusting EAD by adding back amortization of premiums and by removing accretion of discounts and non-cash items, such as stock dividends. We use CAD to evaluate our performance and our current ability to pay distributions. We also believe that providing CAD as a supplement to GAAP net income (loss) to our investors is helpful to their assessment of our performance and our current ability to pay distributions. CAD does not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operating activities, a measure of our liquidity or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. Our computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other REITs.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EAD and CAD to GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 198: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>256.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of stock-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>269.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan loss (benefit) provision (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> One-time non-cash item (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,053 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized (gains) or losses (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,811 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,263 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>952.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EAD attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EAD per Diluted Weighted-Average Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of premiums\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion of discounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,587 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,053 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>430.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock dividends received\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(538 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CAD attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,994 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CAD per Diluted Weighted-Average Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 199: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> We have modified our calculation of EAD and CAD to exclude any add back of loan loss (benefit) provision beginning with our fiscal year 2021.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(2) </td> <td>One-time non-cash item is the make-whole premium in the JCAP preferred stock investment conversion to common stock.

Our investments generate liquidity on an ongoing basis through principal and interest payments, prepayments and dividends. We believe that our available cash, expected operating cash flows, and potential debt or equity financings will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated scheduled debt service payments, potential obligations to purchase up to $18.6 million of the Preferred Units and dividend requirements for the twelve-month period following December 31, 2021.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of acquiring additional investments, scheduled debt payments and distributions. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, which may include future debt or equity issuances, net cash provided by operations and other secured and unsecured borrowings. Our leverage is matched in term and structure to provide stable contractual spreads which will protect us from fluctuations in market interest rates over the long-term. However, there are a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including the state of overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders, general market conditions for REITs and our operating performance and liquidity. We believe that our various sources of capital, which may include future debt or equity issuances, net cash provided by operations and other secured and unsecured borrowings, will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated debt service payments, potential obligations to purchase Preferred Units and dividend requirements for the long-term.\nTable 216: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td>

</tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources to date consist of cash generated from our operating results and the following:\nKeyBank Bridge Facility\nOn February 7, 2020, we, through our subsidiaries, entered into a $95.0 million bridge facility (the Bridge Facility\u201d) with KeyBank National Association ( KeyBank\u201d) and immediately drew $95.0 million to fund a portion of the Formation Transaction. We used proceeds from the IPO to pay down the entirety of the Bridge Facility.\nRaymond James Bridge Facility\nOn July 30, 2020, we, through our subsidiaries, entered into an $86.0 million bridge facility (the RJ Bridge Facility\u201d) with Raymond James Bank, N.A. and drew $21.0 million on July 30, 2020 and $65.0 million on August 7, 2020. We used proceeds from the RJ Bridge Facility to finance the acquisitions of the FREMF 2020-KF81 and FREMF 2020-K113 securitization. The RJ Bridge Facility was repaid in full in August 2020.\nOn December 8, 2021, we, through our Subsidiary OPs, entered into the $20.0 million 2021 RJ Bridge Facility with Raymond James Bank, N.A. and immediately drew $20.0 million. We used the proceeds from the 2021 RJ Bridge Facility to finance the acquisition of the FREMF 2021-KI08 securitization. The 2021 RJ Bridge Facility was repaid in full in December 2021 and is no longer outstanding.\nFreddie Mac Credit Facilities\nPrior to the Formation Transaction, two of our subsidiaries entered into a loan and security agreement, dated July 12, 2019, with Freddie Mac (the Credit Facility\u201d). Under the Credit Facility, these entities borrowed approximately $788.8 million in connection with their acquisition of senior pooled mortgage loans backed by SFR properties (the Underlying Loans\u201d). No additional borrowings can be made under the Credit Facility, and our obligations will be secured by the Underlying Loans. The Credit Facility was assumed by the Company as part of the Formation Transaction. As such, the remaining outstanding balance of $788.8 million was contributed to the Company on February 11, 2020. Our borrowings under the Credit Facility will mature on July 12, 2029. However, if an Underlying Loan matures prior to July 12, 2029, we will be required to repay the portion of the Credit Facility that is allocated to that loan (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information). As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance on the Credit Facility was $726.3 million.\nOn October 20, 2020, the Company acquired a portfolio of 18 mezzanine loans with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of approximately $97.9 million. Freddie Mac provided seller financing of approximately $59.9 million with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 0.30%. Proceeds from the OP Notes offering and cash on hand were used to fund the remainder of the purchase price.\nCash Generated from IPO\nOn February 11, 2020, we completed our IPO in which we sold 5,350,000 shares of common stock (including 350,000 shares pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares) at a price of $19.00 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $101.7 million. The IPO generated net proceeds of approximately $91.5 million to us after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $6.9 million and offering expenses of approximately $3.3 million.\nWe contributed the net proceeds from the IPO to our OP in exchange for OP Units and our OP contributed the net proceeds from the IPO to our Subsidiary OPs for SubOP Units. Our Subsidiary OPs used the net proceeds from the IPO to repay the amount outstanding under the $95 million Bridge Facility, consistent with our investment strategy and guidelines.\nPreferred Stock Offering\nAs discussed in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, on July 24, 2020, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock at a price to the public of $24.00 per share, for gross proceeds of $48.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses. The Series A Preferred Stock has a $25.00 per share liquidation preference.\nOP Notes Offering\nOn October 15, 2020, the OP issued the OP Notes with a coupon rate of 7.5% and aggregate principal amount of $36.5 million at approximately 99% of par value for proceeds of approximately $36.1 million before offering costs.\nRepurchase Agreements\nFrom time to time, we may enter into repurchase agreements to finance the acquisition of our target assets. Repurchase agreements will effectively allow us to borrow against loans and securities that we own in an amount equal to (1) the market value of such loans and/or securities multiplied by (2) the applicable advance rate. Under these agreements, we will sell our loans and securities to a counterparty and agree to repurchase the same loans and securities from the counterparty at a price equal to the original sales price plus an interest factor. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we will receive the principal and interest on the related loans and securities and pay interest to the lender under the repurchase agreement. At any point in time, the amounts and the cost of our repurchase borrowings will be based on the assets being financed. For example, higher risk assets will result in lower advance rates (i.e., levels of leverage) at higher borrowing costs. In addition, these facilities may include various financial covenants and limited recourse guarantees.\nAs discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, in connection with our recent CMBS acquisitions, we, through the OP and the Subsidiary OPs, have borrowed approximately $286.3 million under our repurchase agreements and posted approximately $2.1 billion par value of our CMBS B-Piece and CMBS I/O Strip investments as collateral. The CMBS B-Pieces and CMBS I/O Strips held as collateral are illiquid and irreplaceable in nature. These assets are restricted solely to satisfy the interest and principal balances owed to the lender.\nThe table below provides additional details regarding recent borrowings under the master repurchase agreements:\nTable 217: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2021\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Collateral\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Date issued\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Outstanding face amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Carrying value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Final stated maturity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Weighted average interest rate (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Weighted average life (years) (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Outstanding face amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amortized cost basis\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Carrying value (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Weighted average life (years) (2)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Master Repurchase Agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CMBS\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mizuho(4)\n</td> <td> 4/15/2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>286,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>286,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.97 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,101,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>499,975 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>531,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 218: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Weighted-average interest rate using unpaid principal balances.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 219: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Weighted-average life is determined using the maximum maturity date of the corresponding loans, assuming all extension options are exercised by the borrower.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 220: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>(3) </td> <td>CMBS are shown at fair value on an unconsolidated basis. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(4) </td> <td>On April 15, 2020, three of our subsidiaries entered into a master repurchase agreement with Mizuho.

The Equity Distribution Agreements provided for the issuance and sale of common stock or Series A Preferred Stock by the Company through a sales agent acting as a sales agent or directly to the sales agent acting as principal for its own account at a price agreed upon at the time of sale. Effective as of December 16, 2021, the Company terminated each Equity Distribution Agreement. As of the termination date, pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreements, the Company had sold 532,694 shares of its common stock and 0 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for total gross sales of $11.3 million. For additional information about the ATM Program, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nCompany Notes Offering\nOn April 20, 2021, the Company issued $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Notes at a price equal to 99.5% of par value for proceeds of approximately $73.1 million after original issue discount and underwriting fees.\nOn December 20, 2021, the Company issued an additional $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Notes at a price equal to 102.8% par value, including accrued interest, for proceeds of approximately $60.9 million after original issue discount and underwriting fees.\nOn January 25, 2022, the Company issued an additional $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Notes at a price equal to 100.9% par value, including accrued interest, for proceeds of approximately $35.1 million after original issue discount and underwriting fees.\nSecondary Public Offering\nOn August 18, 2021, the Company the OP and the Manager entered into the Underwriting Agreement with Raymond James as representative of the several Underwriters, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell 2,000,000 Firm Shares at a public offering price of $21.00 per share. The Company also granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 300,000 Option Shares. The Firm Shares were issued on August 20, 2021. On September 8, 2021, the Underwriters partially exercised the option to purchase 59,700 Option Shares. The 59,700 Option Shares were issued on September 10, 2021. For additional information about this public offering, see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.\nLIBOR Transition\nApproximately 5.9% of our portfolio by unpaid principal balance as of December 31, 2021 pays interest at a variable rate that is tied to LIBOR, and it is anticipated that future investments we make may have variable interest rates tied to LIBOR. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that all of the LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative (i) immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of the 1-week and 2-month US dollar settings; and (ii) immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining one-month, three-month, six-month and twelve-month US dollar settings. The tenors that were extended to June 30, 2023 are more widely used and are the tenors used in our LIBOR-based debt. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has identified as a best-practice replacement the SOFR, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities. Although there have been a few issuances utilizing SOFR, it is unknown whether SOFR or another alternative reference rate will attain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. In connection with the foregoing, we may need to renegotiate some of our agreements to determine a replacement index or rate of interest. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has not received any LIBOR transition notices under its loan agreements. Any changes to benchmark interest rates could increase our financing costs, which could impact our results of operations, cash flows and the market value of our investments and result in mismatches with the interest rate of investments that we are financing.\nOther Potential Sources of Financing\nWe may seek additional sources of liquidity from further repurchase facilities, other borrowings and future offerings of common and preferred equity and debt securities and contributions from existing holders of the OP or Subsidiary OPs. In addition, we may apply our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to any liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents were $26.5 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents selected data from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 221: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,902 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>517,878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(68,261 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(567,415 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,830 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(239 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,471 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,471 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nCash flows from operating activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $49.3 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the interest income generated by our investments and the change in unrealized loss on investments held at fair value.\nCash flows from investing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by investing activities was $517.9 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $68.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by proceeds received from payments on mortgage loans held in VIEs.\nCash flows from financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in financing activities was $567.4 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $68.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by distributions to bondholders of VIEs.\nEmerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\nWe are also a smaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, and may elect to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies. We may be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2020. We believe that our organization and proposed method of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85% of our ordinary income, (2) 95% of our capital gain net income and (3) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing taxable income. Any resulting corporate liability could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.\nWe evaluate the accounting and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d (greater than 50 percent probability) of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Our management is required to analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major jurisdictions, which include federal and certain states. We have no examinations in progress, and none are expected at this time.\nWe recognize our tax positions and evaluate them using a two-step process. First, we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Second, we will determine the amount of benefit to recognize and record the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We had no material unrecognized tax benefit or expense, accrued interest or penalties as of December 31, 2021.\nDividends\nWe intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock. We also intend to make the accrued dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock, which are payable quarterly in arrears as provided in the articles supplementary setting forth the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85% of our ordinary income, (2) 95% of our capital gain net income and (3) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments of all or substantially all of our taxable income, which is not used to pay a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock, to holders of our common stock out of assets legally available for this purpose, if and to the extent authorized by our Board. Before we make any dividend payments, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise additional capital to make cash dividends or we may make a portion of the required dividend in the form of a taxable distribution of stock or debt securities.\nWe will make dividend payments to holders of our common stock based on our estimate of taxable earnings per share of common stock, but not earnings calculated pursuant to GAAP. Our dividends and taxable income and GAAP earnings will typically differ due to items such as depreciation and amortization, fair-value adjustments, differences in premium amortization and discount accretion, and non-deductible G&A expenses. Our quarterly dividends per share of our common stock may be substantially different than our quarterly taxable earnings and GAAP earnings per share. Our Board declared our fourth quarterly dividend of 2021 to common stockholders of $0.4750 per share on November 3, 2021, which was paid on December 30, 2021 to common stockholders of record on December 15, 2021. On November 3, 2021, our Board declared the sixth preferred stock dividend of $0.53125 per share, which was paid on January 25, 2022 to preferred stockholders of record on January 14, 2022. In addition, a subsidiary of the OP (\"REIT Sub\") paid a distribution of $60.00 per preferred membership unit of the REIT Sub ( Preferred Membership Unit\u201d) on December 30, 2021 to holders of records of the Preferred Membership Units on December 15, 2021.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nExcept as otherwise disclosed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, the Company is not aware of any contractual obligations, legal proceedings, or any other contingent obligations incurred in the normal course of business that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate these judgments, assumptions and estimates for changes that would affect the reported amounts. These estimates are based on management's historical industry experience and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these judgments, assumptions and estimates. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that involve significant estimation uncertainty that have or are reasonable likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company performs a quarterly evaluation of loans classified as held for investment for impairment on a loan by loan basis in accordance with ASC 310-10-35, Receivables, Subsequent Measurement ( ASC 310-10-35\u201d). If we deem that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts owed according to the contractual terms of a loan, impairment of that loan is indicated. If we consider a loan to be impaired, we will establish an allowance for loan losses, through a valuation provision in earnings that reduces carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate or the fair value of the collateral, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. For non-impaired loans with no specific allowance the Company determines an allowance for loan losses in accordance with ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies ( ASC 450-20\u201d), which represents management's best estimate of incurred losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date, excluding impaired loans and loans carried at fair value. Management considers quantitative factors likely to cause estimated credit losses including default rate and loss severity rates. The Company also evaluates qualitative factors such as macroeconomic conditions, evaluations of underlying collateral, trends in delinquencies and non-performing assets. Increases to (or reversals of) the allowance for loan loss are included in Loan loss benefit (provision)\u201d on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining impairment and in estimating the resulting loss allowance, and actual losses, if any, could materially differ from those estimates.\nValuation of NSP, Inc.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company owns approximately 25.8% of the total outstanding shares of NSP and thus can exercise significant influence over NSP. The Company elected the fair-value option in accordance with ASC 825-10-10. On a quarterly basis, the Company hires an independent third-party valuation firm to provide an updated fair value for subsequent measurement absent a readily available market price. The valuation is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow methodology whereby observable market terminal capitalization rates and discount rates are applied to projected cash flows generated by self-storage assets owned by NSP. The necessary inputs for the valuation include projected cash flows of NSP, terminal capitalization rates and discount rates. These inputs are reflective of public company comparables, but are assumptions and estimates. As a result, the determination of fair value is uncertain because it involves subjective judgments and estimates that are unobservable. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the unrealized gain related to the change in fair value estimate is $13.8 million. See Notes 5 and 10 for additional disclosures regarding the valuation of NSP.\nREIT Tax Election\nWe elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income,\u201d as defined by the Code, to our stockholders. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. We believe that our organization and current and proposed method of operation will allow us to qualify for taxation as a REIT, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. The following should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected, forecasted, or expected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report. Our management believes the assumptions underlying the Company's financial statements and accompanying notes are reasonable. However, the Company's financial statements and accompanying notes may not be an indication of our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial mortgage REIT incorporated in Maryland on June 7, 2019. Our strategy is to originate, structure and invest in first-lien mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, convertible notes, multifamily properties and common stock investments, as well as multifamily CMBS securitizations. We primarily focus on investments in real estate sectors where our senior management team has operating expertise, including in the multifamily, SFR, self-storage, life science, hospitality and office sectors predominantly in the top 50 MSAs. In addition, we target lending or investing in properties that are stabilized or have a light-transitional business plan.\nOur investment objective is to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns for stockholders over the long term. We seek to employ a flexible and relative-value focused investment strategy and expect to re-allocate capital periodically among our target investment classes. We believe this flexibility will enable us to efficiently manage risk and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns under a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. For highlights of our acquisition, financing and other activity during 2021, see Item 1. Business-2021 Highlights.\u201d Our business continues to be subject to the uncertainties associated with COVID-19. For additional information, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risk Factors Related to our Business-The current COVID-19 pandemic and the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases could materially and adversely impact or disrupt our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance.\u201d\nWe are externally managed by our Manager, a subsidiary of our Sponsor, an SEC-registered investment advisor, which has extensive real estate experience, having completed as of December 31, 2021 approximately $15.0 billion of gross real estate transactions since the beginning of 2012. In addition, our Sponsor, together with its affiliates, including NexBank, is one of the most experienced global alternative credit managers managing approximately $14.7 billion of loans and debt or credit related investments as of December 31, 2021 and has managed credit investments for over 25 years. We believe our relationship with our Sponsor benefits us by providing access to resources including research capabilities, an extensive relationship network, other proprietary information, scalability, and a vast wealth of knowledge of information on real estate in our target assets and sectors.\nWe elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2020. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain one or more exclusions or exemptions from registration under the Investment Company Act.\nOn October 15, 2021, a lawsuit was filed by a trust set up in connection with the Highland bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. The lawsuit makes claims against a number of entities, including our Sponsor and James Dondero. The lawsuit does not include claims related to our business or our assets or operations. Our Sponsor and Mr. Dondero have informed us they believe the lawsuit has no merit and they intend to vigorously defend against the claims. We do not expect the lawsuit will have a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nComponents of Our Revenues and Expenses\nNet Interest Income\nInterest income. Our earnings are primarily attributable to the interest income from mortgage loans, mezzanine loan and preferred equity investments. Loan premium/discount amortization and prepayment penalties are also included as components of interest income.\nInterest expense. Interest expense represents interest accrued on our various financing obligations used to fund our investments and is shown as a deduction to arrive at net interest income.\nThe following table presents the components of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 192: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended

Includes unrealized gain (loss) based on changes in the fair value of our common stock investment in NSP. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nLoan loss benefit (provision). Loan loss benefit (provision) represents the change in our allowance for loan losses. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDividend income. Dividend income represents the accrued interest income and quarterly cash and stock dividends earned on our preferred stock investment in Jernigan Capital, Inc. ( JCAP\u201d).\nRealized losses. Realized losses include the excess, or deficiency, of net proceeds received, less the carrying value of such investments, as realized losses. The Company reverses cumulative unrealized gains or losses previously reported in its Consolidated Statements of Operations with respect to the investment sold at the time of the sale.\nOther income. Includes placement fees, exit fees and other miscellaneous income items.\nOperating Expenses\nG&A expenses. G&A expenses include, but are not limited to, audit fees, legal fees, listing fees, Board fees, equity-based and other compensation expenses, investor-relations costs and payments of reimbursements to our Manager. The Manager will be reimbursed for expenses it incurs on behalf of the Company. However, our Manager is responsible, and we will not reimburse our Manager or its affiliates, for the salaries or benefits to be paid to personnel of our Manager or its affiliates who serve as our officers, except that 50% of the salary of our VP of Finance is allocated to us and we may grant equity awards to our officers under the NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. 2020 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 2020 LTIP\u201d). Direct payment of operating expenses by us, which includes compensation expense relating to equity awards granted under the 2020 LTIP, together with reimbursement of operating expenses to our Manager, plus the Annual Fee, may not exceed 2.5% of equity book value determined in accordance with GAAP, for any calendar year or portion thereof, provided, however, that this limitation will not apply to Offering Expenses, legal, accounting, financial, due diligence and other service fees incurred in connection with extraordinary litigation and mergers and acquisitions and other events outside the ordinary course of our business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of certain real estate related investments. To the extent total corporate G&A expenses would otherwise exceed 2.5% of equity book value, our Manager will waive all or a portion of its Annual Fee to keep our total corporate G&A expenses at or below 2.5% of equity book value.\nLoan servicing fees. We pay various service providers fees for loan servicing of our SFR Loans, mezzanine loans and consolidated CMBS trusts. We classify the expenses related to the administration of the SFR Loans and mezzanine loans as servicing fees while the fees associated with the CMBS trusts are included as a component of the change in net assets related to consolidated CMBS variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d).\nManagement fees. Management fees include fees paid to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 196: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,666 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,846 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,248 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,598 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (income) attributable to preferred shareholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,508 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,748 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,760 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (income) attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40,387 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,323 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,064 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>256.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nThe change in our net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily relates to increases in net interest income and other income including changes in net assets related to consolidated CMBS VIEs partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Our net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately $39.6 million. We earned approximately $26.1 million in net interest income, $71.3 million in other income, incurred operating expenses of $13.8 million, allocated $3.5 million of income to preferred stockholders and allocated $40.4 million of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nRevenues\nNet interest income. Net interest income was $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was an increase of approximately $8.4 million. The increase between the periods is primarily due to an increase in investments and the number of days in operation compared to the prior period. Additionally, prepayment penalties related to early paydowns offset by accelerated premium amortization contribute to the increase between the periods. As of December 31, 2021 we own 74 discrete investments compared to 60 as of December 31, 2020.\nOther income. Other income was $71.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was an increase of approximately $45.5 million. This was primarily due to an increase in net assets related to consolidated CMBS VIEs and an increase in fair value marks between the periods.\nExpenses\nG&A expenses. G&A expenses were $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was an increase of approximately $3.0 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in stock compensation expense and a $0.8 million increase in legal fees compared to the prior period.\nLoan servicing fees. Loan servicing fees were $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was an increase of approximately $0.9 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to an increase in loans in the portfolio and the number of days in operation compared to the prior period.\nManagement fees. Management fees were $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was an increase of approximately $0.7 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to an increase in equity as defined by the Management Agreement and the number of days in operation compared to the prior period.\nKey Financial Measures and Indicators\nAs a real estate finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are earnings per share, dividends declared, EAD, CAD and book value per share.\nEarnings Per Share and Dividends Declared\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share and dividends declared per share (in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 197: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,323 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,099 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,206 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,648 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income per share, basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.00 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income per share, diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.74 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividends declared per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.9000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.4198 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nEarnings Available for Distribution and Cash Available for Distribution\nEAD is a non-GAAP financial measure. EAD has replaced our prior presentation of Core Earnings. In addition, Core Earnings results from prior reporting periods have been relabeled EAD. In line with evolving industry practices, we believe EAD more accurately reflects the principal purpose of the measure than the term Core Earnings and will serve as a useful indicator for investors in evaluating our performance and our long-term ability to pay distributions. EAD is defined as the net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, including realized gains and losses not otherwise included in net income (loss), excluding any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income (loss) for the applicable reporting period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income (loss), or in net income (loss) and adding back amortization of stock-based compensation.\nWe use EAD to evaluate our performance which excludes the effects of certain GAAP adjustments and transactions that we believe are not indicative of our current operations and to assess our long-term ability to pay distributions. We believe providing EAD as a supplement to GAAP net income (loss) to our investors is helpful to their assessment of our performance and our long term ability to pay distributions. EAD does not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operating activities, a measure of our liquidity or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. Our computation of EAD may not be comparable to EAD reported by other REITs.\nWe also use EAD as a component of the management fee paid to our Manager. As consideration for the Manager's services, we will pay our Manager an annual management fee of 1.5% of Equity, paid monthly, in cash or shares of our common stock at the election of our Manager. Equity\u201d means (a) the sum of (1) total stockholders' equity immediately prior to our IPO, plus (2) the net proceeds received from all issuances of our equity securities in and after the IPO, plus (3) our cumulative EAD from and after the IPO to the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter, (b) less (1) any distributions to our holders of common stock from and after the IPO to the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter and (2) all amounts that we have paid to repurchase for cash the shares of our equity securities from and after the IPO to the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter. In our calculation of Equity, we will adjust our calculation of EAD to (i) remove the compensation expense relating to awards granted under one or more of our long-term incentive plans that is added back in our calculation of EAD and (ii) adjust net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for (x) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and (y) certain material non-cash income or expense items, in each case of (x) and (y) after discussions between the Manager and independent directors of our Board and approved by a majority of the independent directors of our Board. Additionally, for the avoidance of doubt, Equity does not include the assets contributed to us in the Formation Transaction.\nCAD is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate CAD by adjusting EAD by adding back amortization of premiums and by removing accretion of discounts and non-cash items, such as stock dividends. We use CAD to evaluate our performance and our current ability to pay distributions. We also believe that providing CAD as a supplement to GAAP net income (loss) to our investors is helpful to their assessment of our performance and our current ability to pay distributions. CAD does not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operating activities, a measure of our liquidity or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. Our computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other REITs.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EAD and CAD to GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 198: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>256.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of stock-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>269.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan loss (benefit) provision (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> One-time non-cash item (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,053 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized (gains) or losses (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,811 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,263 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>952.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EAD attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EAD per Diluted Weighted-Average Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of premiums\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion of discounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,587 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,053 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>430.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock dividends received\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(538 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CAD attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,994 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CAD per Diluted Weighted-Average Share\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,378 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 199: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> We have modified our calculation of EAD and CAD to exclude any add back of loan loss (benefit) provision beginning with our fiscal year 2021.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(2) </td> <td>One-time non-cash item is the make-whole premium in the JCAP preferred stock investment conversion to common stock.

Our investments generate liquidity on an ongoing basis through principal and interest payments, prepayments and dividends. We believe that our available cash, expected operating cash flows, and potential debt or equity financings will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated scheduled debt service payments, potential obligations to purchase up to $18.6 million of the Preferred Units and dividend requirements for the twelve-month period following December 31, 2021.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of acquiring additional investments, scheduled debt payments and distributions. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, which may include future debt or equity issuances, net cash provided by operations and other secured and unsecured borrowings. Our leverage is matched in term and structure to provide stable contractual spreads which will protect us from fluctuations in market interest rates over the long-term. However, there are a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including the state of overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders, general market conditions for REITs and our operating performance and liquidity. We believe that our various sources of capital, which may include future debt or equity issuances, net cash provided by operations and other secured and unsecured borrowings, will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated debt service payments, potential obligations to purchase Preferred Units and dividend requirements for the long-term.\nTable 216: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td>

</tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources to date consist of cash generated from our operating results and the following:\nKeyBank Bridge Facility\nOn February 7, 2020, we, through our subsidiaries, entered into a $95.0 million bridge facility (the Bridge Facility\u201d) with KeyBank National Association ( KeyBank\u201d) and immediately drew $95.0 million to fund a portion of the Formation Transaction. We used proceeds from the IPO to pay down the entirety of the Bridge Facility.\nRaymond James Bridge Facility\nOn July 30, 2020, we, through our subsidiaries, entered into an $86.0 million bridge facility (the RJ Bridge Facility\u201d) with Raymond James Bank, N.A. and drew $21.0 million on July 30, 2020 and $65.0 million on August 7, 2020. We used proceeds from the RJ Bridge Facility to finance the acquisitions of the FREMF 2020-KF81 and FREMF 2020-K113 securitization. The RJ Bridge Facility was repaid in full in August 2020.\nOn December 8, 2021, we, through our Subsidiary OPs, entered into the $20.0 million 2021 RJ Bridge Facility with Raymond James Bank, N.A. and immediately drew $20.0 million. We used the proceeds from the 2021 RJ Bridge Facility to finance the acquisition of the FREMF 2021-KI08 securitization. The 2021 RJ Bridge Facility was repaid in full in December 2021 and is no longer outstanding.\nFreddie Mac Credit Facilities\nPrior to the Formation Transaction, two of our subsidiaries entered into a loan and security agreement, dated July 12, 2019, with Freddie Mac (the Credit Facility\u201d). Under the Credit Facility, these entities borrowed approximately $788.8 million in connection with their acquisition of senior pooled mortgage loans backed by SFR properties (the Underlying Loans\u201d). No additional borrowings can be made under the Credit Facility, and our obligations will be secured by the Underlying Loans. The Credit Facility was assumed by the Company as part of the Formation Transaction. As such, the remaining outstanding balance of $788.8 million was contributed to the Company on February 11, 2020. Our borrowings under the Credit Facility will mature on July 12, 2029. However, if an Underlying Loan matures prior to July 12, 2029, we will be required to repay the portion of the Credit Facility that is allocated to that loan (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information). As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance on the Credit Facility was $726.3 million.\nOn October 20, 2020, the Company acquired a portfolio of 18 mezzanine loans with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of approximately $97.9 million. Freddie Mac provided seller financing of approximately $59.9 million with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 0.30%. Proceeds from the OP Notes offering and cash on hand were used to fund the remainder of the purchase price.\nCash Generated from IPO\nOn February 11, 2020, we completed our IPO in which we sold 5,350,000 shares of common stock (including 350,000 shares pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares) at a price of $19.00 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $101.7 million. The IPO generated net proceeds of approximately $91.5 million to us after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $6.9 million and offering expenses of approximately $3.3 million.\nWe contributed the net proceeds from the IPO to our OP in exchange for OP Units and our OP contributed the net proceeds from the IPO to our Subsidiary OPs for SubOP Units. Our Subsidiary OPs used the net proceeds from the IPO to repay the amount outstanding under the $95 million Bridge Facility, consistent with our investment strategy and guidelines.\nPreferred Stock Offering\nAs discussed in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, on July 24, 2020, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock at a price to the public of $24.00 per share, for gross proceeds of $48.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses. The Series A Preferred Stock has a $25.00 per share liquidation preference.\nOP Notes Offering\nOn October 15, 2020, the OP issued the OP Notes with a coupon rate of 7.5% and aggregate principal amount of $36.5 million at approximately 99% of par value for proceeds of approximately $36.1 million before offering costs.\nRepurchase Agreements\nFrom time to time, we may enter into repurchase agreements to finance the acquisition of our target assets. Repurchase agreements will effectively allow us to borrow against loans and securities that we own in an amount equal to (1) the market value of such loans and/or securities multiplied by (2) the applicable advance rate. Under these agreements, we will sell our loans and securities to a counterparty and agree to repurchase the same loans and securities from the counterparty at a price equal to the original sales price plus an interest factor. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we will receive the principal and interest on the related loans and securities and pay interest to the lender under the repurchase agreement. At any point in time, the amounts and the cost of our repurchase borrowings will be based on the assets being financed. For example, higher risk assets will result in lower advance rates (i.e., levels of leverage) at higher borrowing costs. In addition, these facilities may include various financial covenants and limited recourse guarantees.\nAs discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, in connection with our recent CMBS acquisitions, we, through the OP and the Subsidiary OPs, have borrowed approximately $286.3 million under our repurchase agreements and posted approximately $2.1 billion par value of our CMBS B-Piece and CMBS I/O Strip investments as collateral. The CMBS B-Pieces and CMBS I/O Strips held as collateral are illiquid and irreplaceable in nature. These assets are restricted solely to satisfy the interest and principal balances owed to the lender.\nThe table below provides additional details regarding recent borrowings under the master repurchase agreements:\nTable 217: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2021\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Collateral\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Date issued\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Outstanding face amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Carrying value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Final stated maturity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Weighted average interest rate (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Weighted average life (years) (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Outstanding face amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amortized cost basis\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Carrying value (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Weighted average life (years) (2)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Master Repurchase Agreements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CMBS\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mizuho(4)\n</td> <td> 4/15/2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>286,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>286,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.97 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.03 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,101,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>499,975 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>531,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 218: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Weighted-average interest rate using unpaid principal balances.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 219: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Weighted-average life is determined using the maximum maturity date of the corresponding loans, assuming all extension options are exercised by the borrower.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 220: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>(3) </td> <td>CMBS are shown at fair value on an unconsolidated basis. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(4) </td> <td>On April 15, 2020, three of our subsidiaries entered into a master repurchase agreement with Mizuho.

The Equity Distribution Agreements provided for the issuance and sale of common stock or Series A Preferred Stock by the Company through a sales agent acting as a sales agent or directly to the sales agent acting as principal for its own account at a price agreed upon at the time of sale. Effective as of December 16, 2021, the Company terminated each Equity Distribution Agreement. As of the termination date, pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreements, the Company had sold 532,694 shares of its common stock and 0 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for total gross sales of $11.3 million. For additional information about the ATM Program, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nCompany Notes Offering\nOn April 20, 2021, the Company issued $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Notes at a price equal to 99.5% of par value for proceeds of approximately $73.1 million after original issue discount and underwriting fees.\nOn December 20, 2021, the Company issued an additional $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Notes at a price equal to 102.8% par value, including accrued interest, for proceeds of approximately $60.9 million after original issue discount and underwriting fees.\nOn January 25, 2022, the Company issued an additional $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Notes at a price equal to 100.9% par value, including accrued interest, for proceeds of approximately $35.1 million after original issue discount and underwriting fees.\nSecondary Public Offering\nOn August 18, 2021, the Company the OP and the Manager entered into the Underwriting Agreement with Raymond James as representative of the several Underwriters, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell 2,000,000 Firm Shares at a public offering price of $21.00 per share. The Company also granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 300,000 Option Shares. The Firm Shares were issued on August 20, 2021. On September 8, 2021, the Underwriters partially exercised the option to purchase 59,700 Option Shares. The 59,700 Option Shares were issued on September 10, 2021. For additional information about this public offering, see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.\nLIBOR Transition\nApproximately 5.9% of our portfolio by unpaid principal balance as of December 31, 2021 pays interest at a variable rate that is tied to LIBOR, and it is anticipated that future investments we make may have variable interest rates tied to LIBOR. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that all of the LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative (i) immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of the 1-week and 2-month US dollar settings; and (ii) immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining one-month, three-month, six-month and twelve-month US dollar settings. The tenors that were extended to June 30, 2023 are more widely used and are the tenors used in our LIBOR-based debt. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has identified as a best-practice replacement the SOFR, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities. Although there have been a few issuances utilizing SOFR, it is unknown whether SOFR or another alternative reference rate will attain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. In connection with the foregoing, we may need to renegotiate some of our agreements to determine a replacement index or rate of interest. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has not received any LIBOR transition notices under its loan agreements. Any changes to benchmark interest rates could increase our financing costs, which could impact our results of operations, cash flows and the market value of our investments and result in mismatches with the interest rate of investments that we are financing.\nOther Potential Sources of Financing\nWe may seek additional sources of liquidity from further repurchase facilities, other borrowings and future offerings of common and preferred equity and debt securities and contributions from existing holders of the OP or Subsidiary OPs. In addition, we may apply our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to any liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents were $26.5 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents selected data from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 221: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2021\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2020\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,902 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>517,878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(68,261 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(567,415 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,830 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(239 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,471 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,471 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nCash flows from operating activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $49.3 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the interest income generated by our investments and the change in unrealized loss on investments held at fair value.\nCash flows from investing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by investing activities was $517.9 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $68.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by proceeds received from payments on mortgage loans held in VIEs.\nCash flows from financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in financing activities was $567.4 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $68.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by distributions to bondholders of VIEs.\nEmerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\nWe are also a smaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, and may elect to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies. We may be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2020. We believe that our organization and proposed method of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85% of our ordinary income, (2) 95% of our capital gain net income and (3) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing taxable income. Any resulting corporate liability could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.\nWe evaluate the accounting and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d (greater than 50 percent probability) of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Our management is required to analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major jurisdictions, which include federal and certain states. We have no examinations in progress, and none are expected at this time.\nWe recognize our tax positions and evaluate them using a two-step process. First, we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Second, we will determine the amount of benefit to recognize and record the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We had no material unrecognized tax benefit or expense, accrued interest or penalties as of December 31, 2021.\nDividends\nWe intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock. We also intend to make the accrued dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock, which are payable quarterly in arrears as provided in the articles supplementary setting forth the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85% of our ordinary income, (2) 95% of our capital gain net income and (3) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments of all or substantially all of our taxable income, which is not used to pay a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock, to holders of our common stock out of assets legally available for this purpose, if and to the extent authorized by our Board. Before we make any dividend payments, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise additional capital to make cash dividends or we may make a portion of the required dividend in the form of a taxable distribution of stock or debt securities.\nWe will make dividend payments to holders of our common stock based on our estimate of taxable earnings per share of common stock, but not earnings calculated pursuant to GAAP. Our dividends and taxable income and GAAP earnings will typically differ due to items such as depreciation and amortization, fair-value adjustments, differences in premium amortization and discount accretion, and non-deductible G&A expenses. Our quarterly dividends per share of our common stock may be substantially different than our quarterly taxable earnings and GAAP earnings per share. Our Board declared our fourth quarterly dividend of 2021 to common stockholders of $0.4750 per share on November 3, 2021, which was paid on December 30, 2021 to common stockholders of record on December 15, 2021. On November 3, 2021, our Board declared the sixth preferred stock dividend of $0.53125 per share, which was paid on January 25, 2022 to preferred stockholders of record on January 14, 2022. In addition, a subsidiary of the OP (\"REIT Sub\") paid a distribution of $60.00 per preferred membership unit of the REIT Sub ( Preferred Membership Unit\u201d) on December 30, 2021 to holders of records of the Preferred Membership Units on December 15, 2021.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nExcept as otherwise disclosed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, the Company is not aware of any contractual obligations, legal proceedings, or any other contingent obligations incurred in the normal course of business that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate these judgments, assumptions and estimates for changes that would affect the reported amounts. These estimates are based on management's historical industry experience and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these judgments, assumptions and estimates. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that involve significant estimation uncertainty that have or are reasonable likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company performs a quarterly evaluation of loans classified as held for investment for impairment on a loan by loan basis in accordance with ASC 310-10-35, Receivables, Subsequent Measurement ( ASC 310-10-35\u201d). If we deem that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts owed according to the contractual terms of a loan, impairment of that loan is indicated. If we consider a loan to be impaired, we will establish an allowance for loan losses, through a valuation provision in earnings that reduces carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate or the fair value of the collateral, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. For non-impaired loans with no specific allowance the Company determines an allowance for loan losses in accordance with ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies ( ASC 450-20\u201d), which represents management's best estimate of incurred losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date, excluding impaired loans and loans carried at fair value. Management considers quantitative factors likely to cause estimated credit losses including default rate and loss severity rates. The Company also evaluates qualitative factors such as macroeconomic conditions, evaluations of underlying collateral, trends in delinquencies and non-performing assets. Increases to (or reversals of) the allowance for loan loss are included in Loan loss benefit (provision)\u201d on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining impairment and in estimating the resulting loss allowance, and actual losses, if any, could materially differ from those estimates.\nValuation of NSP, Inc.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company owns approximately 25.8% of the total outstanding shares of NSP and thus can exercise significant influence over NSP. The Company elected the fair-value option in accordance with ASC 825-10-10. On a quarterly basis, the Company hires an independent third-party valuation firm to provide an updated fair value for subsequent measurement absent a readily available market price. The valuation is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow methodology whereby observable market terminal capitalization rates and discount rates are applied to projected cash flows generated by self-storage assets owned by NSP. The necessary inputs for the valuation include projected cash flows of NSP, terminal capitalization rates and discount rates. These inputs are reflective of public company comparables, but are assumptions and estimates. As a result, the determination of fair value is uncertain because it involves subjective judgments and estimates that are unobservable. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the unrealized gain related to the change in fair value estimate is $13.8 million. See Notes 5 and 10 for additional disclosures regarding the valuation of NSP.\nREIT Tax Election\nWe elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income,\u201d as defined by the Code, to our stockholders. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. We believe that our organization and current and proposed method of operation will allow us to qualify for taxation as a REIT, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. The following should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected, forecasted, or expected in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in this annual report. Our management believes the assumptions underlying the Company's financial statements and accompanying notes are reasonable. However, the Company's financial statements and accompanying notes may not be an indication of our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial mortgage REIT incorporated in Maryland on June 7, 2019. Our strategy is to originate, structure and invest in first-lien mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, convertible notes, multifamily properties and common stock investments, as well as multifamily CMBS securitizations. We primarily focus on investments in real estate sectors where our senior management team has operating expertise, including in the multifamily, SFR, self-storage, life science, hospitality and office sectors predominantly in the top 50 MSAs. In addition, we target lending or investing in properties that are stabilized or have a light-transitional business plan.\nOur investment objective is to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns for stockholders over the long term. We seek to employ a flexible and relative-value focused investment strategy and expect to re-allocate capital periodically among our target investment classes. We believe this flexibility will enable us to efficiently manage risk and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns under a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. For highlights of our acquisition, financing and other activity during 2021, see Item 1. Business-2021 Highlights.\u201d Our business continues to be subject to the uncertainties associated with COVID-19. For additional information, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risk Factors Related to our Business-The current COVID-19 pandemic and the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases could materially and adversely impact or disrupt our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance.\u201d\nWe are externally managed by our Manager, a subsidiary of our Sponsor, an SEC-registered investment advisor, which has extensive real estate experience, having completed as of December 31, 2021 approximately $15.0 billion of gross real estate transactions since the beginning of 2012. In addition, our Sponsor, together with its affiliates, including NexBank, is one of the most experienced global alternative credit managers managing approximately $14.7 billion of loans and debt or credit related investments as of December 31, 2021 and has managed credit investments for over 25 years. We believe our relationship with our Sponsor benefits us by providing access to resources including research capabilities, an extensive relationship network, other proprietary information, scalability, and a vast wealth of knowledge of information on real estate in our target assets and sectors.\nWe elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2020. We also intend to operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain one or more exclusions or exemptions from registration under the Investment Company Act.\nOn October 15, 2021, a lawsuit was filed by a trust set up in connection with the Highland bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. The lawsuit makes claims against a number of entities, including our Sponsor and James Dondero. The lawsuit does not include claims related to our business or our assets or operations. Our Sponsor and Mr. Dondero have informed us they believe the lawsuit has no merit and they intend to vigorously defend against the claims. We do not expect the lawsuit will have a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nComponents of Our Revenues and Expenses\nNet Interest Income\nInterest income. Our earnings are primarily attributable to the interest income from mortgage loans, mezzanine loan and preferred equity investments. Loan premium/discount amortization and prepayment penalties are also included as components of interest income.\nInterest expense. Interest expense represents interest accrued on our various financing obligations used to fund our investments and is shown as a deduction to arrive at net interest income.\nThe following table presents the components of net interest income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n\n\nOther Income (Loss)\nChange in net assets related to consolidated CMBS variable interest entities. Includes unrealized gain (loss) based on changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the CMBS trusts and net interest earned on the consolidated CMBS trusts. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nChange in unrealized gain on CMBS structured pass through certificates. Includes unrealized gain (loss) based on changes in the fair value of the CMBS I/O Strips. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nChange in unrealized gain on common stock investment held at fair value. Includes unrealized gain (loss) based on changes in the fair value of our common stock investment in NSP. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nLoan loss benefit (provision). Loan loss benefit (provision) represents the change in our allowance for loan losses. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDividend income. Dividend income represents the accrued interest income and quarterly cash and stock dividends earned on our preferred stock investment in Jernigan Capital, Inc. ( JCAP\u201d).\nRealized losses. Realized losses include the excess, or deficiency, of net proceeds received, less the carrying value of such investments, as realized losses. The Company reverses cumulative unrealized gains or losses previously reported in its Consolidated Statements of Operations with respect to the investment sold at the time of the sale.\nOther income. Includes placement fees, exit fees and other miscellaneous income items.\nOperating Expenses\nG&A expenses. G&A expenses include, but are not limited to, audit fees, legal fees, listing fees, Board fees, equity-based and other compensation expenses, investor-relations costs and payments of reimbursements to our Manager. The Manager will be reimbursed for expenses it incurs on behalf of the Company. However, our Manager is responsible, and we will not reimburse our Manager or its affiliates, for the salaries or benefits to be paid to personnel of our Manager or its affiliates who serve as our officers, except that 50% of the salary of our VP of Finance is allocated to us and we may grant equity awards to our officers under the NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. 2020 Long Term Incentive Plan (the 2020 LTIP\u201d). Direct payment of operating expenses by us, which includes compensation expense relating to equity awards granted under the 2020 LTIP, together with reimbursement of operating expenses to our Manager, plus the Annual Fee, may not exceed 2.5% of equity book value determined in accordance with GAAP, for any calendar year or portion thereof, provided, however, that this limitation will not apply to Offering Expenses, legal, accounting, financial, due diligence and other service fees incurred in connection with extraordinary litigation and mergers and acquisitions and other events outside the ordinary course of our business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of certain real estate related investments. To the extent total corporate G&A expenses would otherwise exceed 2.5% of equity book value, our Manager will waive all or a portion of its Annual Fee to keep our total corporate G&A expenses at or below 2.5% of equity book value.\nLoan servicing fees. We pay various service providers fees for loan servicing of our SFR Loans, mezzanine loans and consolidated CMBS trusts. We classify the expenses related to the administration of the SFR Loans and mezzanine loans as servicing fees while the fees associated with the CMBS trusts are included as a component of the change in net assets related to consolidated CMBS variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d).\nManagement fees. Management fees include fees paid to our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\n\nThe change in our net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the net income for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily relates to increases in net interest income and other income including changes in net assets related to consolidated CMBS VIEs partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Our net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately $39.6 million. We earned approximately $26.1 million in net interest income, $71.3 million in other income, incurred operating expenses of $13.8 million, allocated $3.5 million of income to preferred stockholders and allocated $40.4 million of income to redeemable noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nRevenues\nNet interest income. Net interest income was $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was an increase of approximately $8.4 million. The increase between the periods is primarily due to an increase in investments and the number of days in operation compared to the prior period. Additionally, prepayment penalties related to early paydowns offset by accelerated premium amortization contribute to the increase between the periods. As of December 31, 2021 we own 74 discrete investments compared to 60 as of December 31, 2020.\nOther income. Other income was $71.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was an increase of approximately $45.5 million. This was primarily due to an increase in net assets related to consolidated CMBS VIEs and an increase in fair value marks between the periods.\nExpenses\nG&A expenses. G&A expenses were $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was an increase of approximately $3.0 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in stock compensation expense and a $0.8 million increase in legal fees compared to the prior period.\nLoan servicing fees. Loan servicing fees were $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was an increase of approximately $0.9 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to an increase in loans in the portfolio and the number of days in operation compared to the prior period.\nManagement fees. Management fees were $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 which was an increase of approximately $0.7 million. The increase between the periods was primarily due to an increase in equity as defined by the Management Agreement and the number of days in operation compared to the prior period.\nKey Financial Measures and Indicators\nAs a real estate finance company, we believe the key financial measures and indicators for our business are earnings per share, dividends declared, EAD, CAD and book value per share.\nEarnings Per Share and Dividends Declared\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share and dividends declared per share (in thousands, except per share data):\n\nEarnings Available for Distribution and Cash Available for Distribution\nEAD is a non-GAAP financial measure. EAD has replaced our prior presentation of Core Earnings. In addition, Core Earnings results from prior reporting periods have been relabeled EAD. In line with evolving industry practices, we believe EAD more accurately reflects the principal purpose of the measure than the term Core Earnings and will serve as a useful indicator for investors in evaluating our performance and our long-term ability to pay distributions. EAD is defined as the net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, including realized gains and losses not otherwise included in net income (loss), excluding any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income (loss) for the applicable reporting period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income (loss), or in net income (loss) and adding back amortization of stock-based compensation.\nWe use EAD to evaluate our performance which excludes the effects of certain GAAP adjustments and transactions that we believe are not indicative of our current operations and to assess our long-term ability to pay distributions. We believe providing EAD as a supplement to GAAP net income (loss) to our investors is helpful to their assessment of our performance and our long term ability to pay distributions. EAD does not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operating activities, a measure of our liquidity or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. Our computation of EAD may not be comparable to EAD reported by other REITs.\nWe also use EAD as a component of the management fee paid to our Manager. As consideration for the Manager's services, we will pay our Manager an annual management fee of 1.5% of Equity, paid monthly, in cash or shares of our common stock at the election of our Manager. Equity\u201d means (a) the sum of (1) total stockholders' equity immediately prior to our IPO, plus (2) the net proceeds received from all issuances of our equity securities in and after the IPO, plus (3) our cumulative EAD from and after the IPO to the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter, (b) less (1) any distributions to our holders of common stock from and after the IPO to the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter and (2) all amounts that we have paid to repurchase for cash the shares of our equity securities from and after the IPO to the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter. In our calculation of Equity, we will adjust our calculation of EAD to (i) remove the compensation expense relating to awards granted under one or more of our long-term incentive plans that is added back in our calculation of EAD and (ii) adjust net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for (x) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and (y) certain material non-cash income or expense items, in each case of (x) and (y) after discussions between the Manager and independent directors of our Board and approved by a majority of the independent directors of our Board. Additionally, for the avoidance of doubt, Equity does not include the assets contributed to us in the Formation Transaction.\nCAD is a non-GAAP financial measure. We calculate CAD by adjusting EAD by adding back amortization of premiums and by removing accretion of discounts and non-cash items, such as stock dividends. We use CAD to evaluate our performance and our current ability to pay distributions. We also believe that providing CAD as a supplement to GAAP net income (loss) to our investors is helpful to their assessment of our performance and our current ability to pay distributions. CAD does not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income, an indication of our GAAP cash flows from operating activities, a measure of our liquidity or an indication of funds available for our cash needs. Our computation of CAD may not be comparable to CAD reported by other REITs.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EAD and CAD to GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\n\n\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EAD and CAD to GAAP net income including the dilutive effect of non-controlling interests for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\n\n\nBook Value per Share / Unit\nThe following table calculates our book value per share (in thousands, except per share data):\n\nDue to the large noncontrolling interest in the OP and Subsidiary OPs (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, for more information), we believe it is useful to also look at book value on a combined basis as shown in the table below (in thousands, except per share data):\n\nOur Portfolio\nOur portfolio consists of SFR Loans, CMBS B-Pieces, CMBS I/O Strips, mezzanine loans, preferred equity investments, a common stock investment, a convertible note and a multifamily property with a combined unpaid principal balance of $3.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and assumes the CMBS Entities' assets and liabilities are not consolidated. The following table sets forth additional information relating to our portfolio as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following table details overall statistics for our portfolio as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for our ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, maintain our investments, make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs. Our investments generate liquidity on an ongoing basis through principal and interest payments, prepayments and dividends. We believe that our available cash, expected operating cash flows, and potential debt or equity financings will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated scheduled debt service payments, potential obligations to purchase up to $18.6 million of the Preferred Units and dividend requirements for the twelve-month period following December 31, 2021.\nOur long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of acquiring additional investments, scheduled debt payments and distributions. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, which may include future debt or equity issuances, net cash provided by operations and other secured and unsecured borrowings. Our leverage is matched in term and structure to provide stable contractual spreads which will protect us from fluctuations in market interest rates over the long-term. However, there are a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources, including the state of overall equity and credit markets, our degree of leverage, borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders, general market conditions for REITs and our operating performance and liquidity. We believe that our various sources of capital, which may include future debt or equity issuances, net cash provided by operations and other secured and unsecured borrowings, will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated debt service payments, potential obligations to purchase Preferred Units and dividend requirements for the long-term.\n\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources to date consist of cash generated from our operating results and the following:\nKeyBank Bridge Facility\nOn February 7, 2020, we, through our subsidiaries, entered into a $95.0 million bridge facility (the Bridge Facility\u201d) with KeyBank National Association ( KeyBank\u201d) and immediately drew $95.0 million to fund a portion of the Formation Transaction. We used proceeds from the IPO to pay down the entirety of the Bridge Facility.\nRaymond James Bridge Facility\nOn July 30, 2020, we, through our subsidiaries, entered into an $86.0 million bridge facility (the RJ Bridge Facility\u201d) with Raymond James Bank, N.A. and drew $21.0 million on July 30, 2020 and $65.0 million on August 7, 2020. We used proceeds from the RJ Bridge Facility to finance the acquisitions of the FREMF 2020-KF81 and FREMF 2020-K113 securitization. The RJ Bridge Facility was repaid in full in August 2020.\nOn December 8, 2021, we, through our Subsidiary OPs, entered into the $20.0 million 2021 RJ Bridge Facility with Raymond James Bank, N.A. and immediately drew $20.0 million. We used the proceeds from the 2021 RJ Bridge Facility to finance the acquisition of the FREMF 2021-KI08 securitization. The 2021 RJ Bridge Facility was repaid in full in December 2021 and is no longer outstanding.\nFreddie Mac Credit Facilities\nPrior to the Formation Transaction, two of our subsidiaries entered into a loan and security agreement, dated July 12, 2019, with Freddie Mac (the Credit Facility\u201d). Under the Credit Facility, these entities borrowed approximately $788.8 million in connection with their acquisition of senior pooled mortgage loans backed by SFR properties (the Underlying Loans\u201d). No additional borrowings can be made under the Credit Facility, and our obligations will be secured by the Underlying Loans. The Credit Facility was assumed by the Company as part of the Formation Transaction. As such, the remaining outstanding balance of $788.8 million was contributed to the Company on February 11, 2020. Our borrowings under the Credit Facility will mature on July 12, 2029. However, if an Underlying Loan matures prior to July 12, 2029, we will be required to repay the portion of the Credit Facility that is allocated to that loan (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information). As of December 31, 2021, the outstanding balance on the Credit Facility was $726.3 million.\nOn October 20, 2020, the Company acquired a portfolio of 18 mezzanine loans with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of approximately $97.9 million. Freddie Mac provided seller financing of approximately $59.9 million with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 0.30%. Proceeds from the OP Notes offering and cash on hand were used to fund the remainder of the purchase price.\nCash Generated from IPO\nOn February 11, 2020, we completed our IPO in which we sold 5,350,000 shares of common stock (including 350,000 shares pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares) at a price of $19.00 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $101.7 million. The IPO generated net proceeds of approximately $91.5 million to us after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $6.9 million and offering expenses of approximately $3.3 million.\nWe contributed the net proceeds from the IPO to our OP in exchange for OP Units and our OP contributed the net proceeds from the IPO to our Subsidiary OPs for SubOP Units. Our Subsidiary OPs used the net proceeds from the IPO to repay the amount outstanding under the $95 million Bridge Facility, consistent with our investment strategy and guidelines.\nPreferred Stock Offering\nAs discussed in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, on July 24, 2020, the Company issued 2,000,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock at a price to the public of $24.00 per share, for gross proceeds of $48.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses. The Series A Preferred Stock has a $25.00 per share liquidation preference.\nOP Notes Offering\nOn October 15, 2020, the OP issued the OP Notes with a coupon rate of 7.5% and aggregate principal amount of $36.5 million at approximately 99% of par value for proceeds of approximately $36.1 million before offering costs.\nRepurchase Agreements\nFrom time to time, we may enter into repurchase agreements to finance the acquisition of our target assets. Repurchase agreements will effectively allow us to borrow against loans and securities that we own in an amount equal to (1) the market value of such loans and/or securities multiplied by (2) the applicable advance rate. Under these agreements, we will sell our loans and securities to a counterparty and agree to repurchase the same loans and securities from the counterparty at a price equal to the original sales price plus an interest factor. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we will receive the principal and interest on the related loans and securities and pay interest to the lender under the repurchase agreement. At any point in time, the amounts and the cost of our repurchase borrowings will be based on the assets being financed. For example, higher risk assets will result in lower advance rates (i.e., levels of leverage) at higher borrowing costs. In addition, these facilities may include various financial covenants and limited recourse guarantees.\nAs discussed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements, in connection with our recent CMBS acquisitions, we, through the OP and the Subsidiary OPs, have borrowed approximately $286.3 million under our repurchase agreements and posted approximately $2.1 billion par value of our CMBS B-Piece and CMBS I/O Strip investments as collateral. The CMBS B-Pieces and CMBS I/O Strips held as collateral are illiquid and irreplaceable in nature. These assets are restricted solely to satisfy the interest and principal balances owed to the lender.\nThe table below provides additional details regarding recent borrowings under the master repurchase agreements:\n\n\n\n\nAt-The-Market Offering\nOn March 31, 2021, the Company, the OP and the Manager separately entered into the Equity Distribution Agreements with the Sales Agents, pursuant to which the Company could issue and sell from time to time shares of the Company's common stock and Series A Preferred Stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $100.0 million in the ATM Program. The Equity Distribution Agreements provided for the issuance and sale of common stock or Series A Preferred Stock by the Company through a sales agent acting as a sales agent or directly to the sales agent acting as principal for its own account at a price agreed upon at the time of sale. Effective as of December 16, 2021, the Company terminated each Equity Distribution Agreement. As of the termination date, pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreements, the Company had sold 532,694 shares of its common stock and 0 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for total gross sales of $11.3 million. For additional information about the ATM Program, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.\nCompany Notes Offering\nOn April 20, 2021, the Company issued $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Notes at a price equal to 99.5% of par value for proceeds of approximately $73.1 million after original issue discount and underwriting fees.\nOn December 20, 2021, the Company issued an additional $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Notes at a price equal to 102.8% par value, including accrued interest, for proceeds of approximately $60.9 million after original issue discount and underwriting fees.\nOn January 25, 2022, the Company issued an additional $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Notes at a price equal to 100.9% par value, including accrued interest, for proceeds of approximately $35.1 million after original issue discount and underwriting fees.\nSecondary Public Offering\nOn August 18, 2021, the Company the OP and the Manager entered into the Underwriting Agreement with Raymond James as representative of the several Underwriters, pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell 2,000,000 Firm Shares at a public offering price of $21.00 per share. The Company also granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 300,000 Option Shares. The Firm Shares were issued on August 20, 2021. On September 8, 2021, the Underwriters partially exercised the option to purchase 59,700 Option Shares. The 59,700 Option Shares were issued on September 10, 2021. For additional information about this public offering, see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.\nLIBOR Transition\nApproximately 5.9% of our portfolio by unpaid principal balance as of December 31, 2021 pays interest at a variable rate that is tied to LIBOR, and it is anticipated that future investments we make may have variable interest rates tied to LIBOR. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that all of the LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative (i) immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of the 1-week and 2-month US dollar settings; and (ii) immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining one-month, three-month, six-month and twelve-month US dollar settings. The tenors that were extended to June 30, 2023 are more widely used and are the tenors used in our LIBOR-based debt. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has identified as a best-practice replacement the SOFR, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities. Although there have been a few issuances utilizing SOFR, it is unknown whether SOFR or another alternative reference rate will attain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. In connection with the foregoing, we may need to renegotiate some of our agreements to determine a replacement index or rate of interest. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has not received any LIBOR transition notices under its loan agreements. Any changes to benchmark interest rates could increase our financing costs, which could impact our results of operations, cash flows and the market value of our investments and result in mismatches with the interest rate of investments that we are financing.\nOther Potential Sources of Financing\nWe may seek additional sources of liquidity from further repurchase facilities, other borrowings and future offerings of common and preferred equity and debt securities and contributions from existing holders of the OP or Subsidiary OPs. In addition, we may apply our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to any liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents were $26.5 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents selected data from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\n\nCash flows from operating activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $49.3 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the interest income generated by our investments and the change in unrealized loss on investments held at fair value.\nCash flows from investing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by investing activities was $517.9 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $68.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by proceeds received from payments on mortgage loans held in VIEs.\nCash flows from financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in financing activities was $567.4 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $68.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by distributions to bondholders of VIEs.\nEmerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.\nWe are also a smaller reporting company\u201d as defined in Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, and may elect to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies. We may be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2020. We believe that our organization and proposed method of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85% of our ordinary income, (2) 95% of our capital gain net income and (3) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing taxable income. Any resulting corporate liability could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from re-electing to be taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.\nWe evaluate the accounting and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not\u201d (greater than 50 percent probability) of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Our management is required to analyze all open tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major jurisdictions, which include federal and certain states. We have no examinations in progress, and none are expected at this time.\nWe recognize our tax positions and evaluate them using a two-step process. First, we determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Second, we will determine the amount of benefit to recognize and record the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We had no material unrecognized tax benefit or expense, accrued interest or penalties as of December 31, 2021.\nDividends\nWe intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments to holders of our common stock. We also intend to make the accrued dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock, which are payable quarterly in arrears as provided in the articles supplementary setting forth the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock. U.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. As a REIT, we will be subject to federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we pay with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (1) 85% of our ordinary income, (2) 95% of our capital gain net income and (3) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. We intend to make regular quarterly dividend payments of all or substantially all of our taxable income, which is not used to pay a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock, to holders of our common stock out of assets legally available for this purpose, if and to the extent authorized by our Board. Before we make any dividend payments, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service on our debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets, borrow funds or raise additional capital to make cash dividends or we may make a portion of the required dividend in the form of a taxable distribution of stock or debt securities.\nWe will make dividend payments to holders of our common stock based on our estimate of taxable earnings per share of common stock, but not earnings calculated pursuant to GAAP. Our dividends and taxable income and GAAP earnings will typically differ due to items such as depreciation and amortization, fair-value adjustments, differences in premium amortization and discount accretion, and non-deductible G&A expenses. Our quarterly dividends per share of our common stock may be substantially different than our quarterly taxable earnings and GAAP earnings per share. Our Board declared our fourth quarterly dividend of 2021 to common stockholders of $0.4750 per share on November 3, 2021, which was paid on December 30, 2021 to common stockholders of record on December 15, 2021. On November 3, 2021, our Board declared the sixth preferred stock dividend of $0.53125 per share, which was paid on January 25, 2022 to preferred stockholders of record on January 14, 2022. In addition, a subsidiary of the OP (\"REIT Sub\") paid a distribution of $60.00 per preferred membership unit of the REIT Sub ( Preferred Membership Unit\u201d) on December 30, 2021 to holders of records of the Preferred Membership Units on December 15, 2021.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nExcept as otherwise disclosed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, the Company is not aware of any contractual obligations, legal proceedings, or any other contingent obligations incurred in the normal course of business that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate these judgments, assumptions and estimates for changes that would affect the reported amounts. These estimates are based on management's historical industry experience and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these judgments, assumptions and estimates. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that involve significant estimation uncertainty that have or are reasonable likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company performs a quarterly evaluation of loans classified as held for investment for impairment on a loan by loan basis in accordance with ASC 310-10-35, Receivables, Subsequent Measurement ( ASC 310-10-35\u201d). If we deem that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts owed according to the contractual terms of a loan, impairment of that loan is indicated. If we consider a loan to be impaired, we will establish an allowance for loan losses, through a valuation provision in earnings that reduces carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate or the fair value of the collateral, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. For non-impaired loans with no specific allowance the Company determines an allowance for loan losses in accordance with ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies ( ASC 450-20\u201d), which represents management's best estimate of incurred losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date, excluding impaired loans and loans carried at fair value. Management considers quantitative factors likely to cause estimated credit losses including default rate and loss severity rates. The Company also evaluates qualitative factors such as macroeconomic conditions, evaluations of underlying collateral, trends in delinquencies and non-performing assets. Increases to (or reversals of) the allowance for loan loss are included in Loan loss benefit (provision)\u201d on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining impairment and in estimating the resulting loss allowance, and actual losses, if any, could materially differ from those estimates.\nValuation of NSP, Inc.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company owns approximately 25.8% of the total outstanding shares of NSP and thus can exercise significant influence over NSP. The Company elected the fair-value option in accordance with ASC 825-10-10. On a quarterly basis, the Company hires an independent third-party valuation firm to provide an updated fair value for subsequent measurement absent a readily available market price. The valuation is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow methodology whereby observable market terminal capitalization rates and discount rates are applied to projected cash flows generated by self-storage assets owned by NSP. The necessary inputs for the valuation include projected cash flows of NSP, terminal capitalization rates and discount rates. These inputs are reflective of public company comparables, but are assumptions and estimates. As a result, the determination of fair value is uncertain because it involves subjective judgments and estimates that are unobservable. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the unrealized gain related to the change in fair value estimate is $13.8 million. See Notes 5 and 10 for additional disclosures regarding the valuation of NSP.\nREIT Tax Election\nWe elected to be treated as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income,\u201d as defined by the Code, to our stockholders. Taxable income from certain non-REIT activities is managed through a TRS and is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes. We had no significant taxes associated with our TRS for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. We believe that our organization and current and proposed method of operation will allow us to qualify for taxation as a REIT, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT.", "item_7_tables": "Table 192: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and notes. It contains forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected ones.\n\nThe REIT, incorporated in Maryland on June 7, 2019, focuses on originating and investing in mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, convertible notes, multifamily properties and common stock investments, as well as multifamily CMBS securitizations, primarily in the top 50 MSAs. It aims to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns over the long term.\n\nThe REIT, externally managed by a subsidiary of a Sponsor (an SEC-registered investment advisor), has experience in real estate transactions and credit investments. It maintains flexibility in its investment strategy to efficiently manage risk and optimize returns under different market conditions and economic cycles. The REIT targets stabilized properties or those with light-transitional business plans.\n\nThe business has been affected by COVID-19 uncertainties. Additionally, a lawsuit was filed against its Sponsor, which it believes is without merit and will not materially affect its operations.\n\nInterest income, the primary revenue source, comes from mortgage loans, mezzanine loan, and preferred equity investments. Interest expense, deducted from revenue to arrive at net interest income, is accrued on various financing obligations.\n\nSignificant net interest income and other income increases, along with operating expense increases, were reported in 2021 compared to 2020. Net income attributable to common stockholders was approximately $39.6 million in 2021.\n\nEarnings Per Share and dividends declared are disclosed, along with Earnings Available for Distribution (EAD) and Cash Available for Distribution (CAD), which are non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nKey financial measures for the REIT involve earnings per share, dividends declared, Effective Annual Debt (EAD), Cash Available for Distribution (CAD), and book value per share.\n\nThe REIT's liquidity is sourced from cash flows, debt, and equity financings, and it has various credit facilities to support operations. It aims to pay dividends regularly and comply with REIT distribution requirements, although distributed amounts may differ from its taxable earnings.\n\nThe REIT has made a significant election regarding the adoption of new accounting standards and benefits from a \"smaller reporting company\" status. Tax-wise, it operates as a REIT, which affects its income taxes and distribution strategy; it has no significant unrecognized tax benefits or expenses.\n\nConcerning off-balance sheet arrangements and commitments, the REIT has no material exposure. The report discusses critical accounting policies involving loan loss allowances, valuation of investments, and REIT tax election.\n\nLastly, financing activities and cash flows analysis are presented, highlighting operating activities, investing activities, financing activities, and the overall increase (or decrease) in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n(Note: Specific financial figures and quantitative data have been omitted from this summary due to their extensive nature)."}
