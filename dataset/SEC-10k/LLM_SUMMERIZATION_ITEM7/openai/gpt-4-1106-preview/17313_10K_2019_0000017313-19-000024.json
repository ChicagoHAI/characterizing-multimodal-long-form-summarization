Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Statements we make in the following discussion which express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors, including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the headings Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an internally managed closed-end, non-diversified investment company that has been elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We specialize in providing customized debt and equity financing to LMM companies and debt capital to UMM companies in a broad range of investment segments located primarily in the United States. Our investment objective is to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity and equity related investments. Our investment strategy is to partner with business owners, management teams and financial sponsors to provide flexible financing solutions to fund growth, changes of control, or other corporate events. We invest primarily in senior debt securities, secured by security interests in portfolio company assets, and in secured and unsecured subordinated debt securities. We also invest in equity interests in our portfolio companies alongside our debt securities.\nWe focus on investing in companies with histories of generating revenues and positive cash flow, established market positions and proven management teams with strong operating discipline. We target senior debt, subordinated debt, and equity investments in LMM companies, as well as first and second lien syndicated loans in UMM companies. Our target LMM companies\ntypically have annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) between $3.0 million and $15.0 million, and our LMM investments generally range in size from $5.0 million to $25.0 million. Our UMM investments generally include syndicated first and second lien loans in companies with EBITDA generally greater than $50.0 million, and our UMM investments typically range in size from $5.0 million to $15.0 million.\nWe seek to fill the financing gap for LMM companies, which, historically, have had more limited access to financing from commercial banks and other traditional sources. The underserved nature of the LMM creates the opportunity for us to meet the financing needs of LMM companies while also negotiating favorable transaction terms and equity participations. Our ability to invest across a LMM company's capital structure, from secured loans to equity securities, allows us to offer portfolio companies a comprehensive suite of financing options. Providing customized financing solutions is important to LMM companies. We generally seek to partner directly with financial sponsors, entrepreneurs, management teams and business owners in making our investments. Our LMM debt investments typically include senior loans with a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company, as well as subordinated debt which may either be secured or unsecured subordinated loans. Our LMM debt investments typically have a term of between five and seven years from the original investment date. We also often seek to invest in the equity securities of our LMM portfolio companies.\nOur investments in UMM companies primarily consist of direct investments in or secondary purchases of interest bearing debt securities in privately held companies that are generally larger in size than the LMM companies included in our portfolio. Our UMM debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have an expected duration of between three and seven years from the original investment date.\nSince the Share Distribution on September 30, 2015 through March 31, 2019, our exited investments resulted in a weighted average internal rate of return to the Company of approximately 18.2% (based on original cash invested of approximately $165.0 million). Internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows related to a particular investment equal to zero. Internal rate of return is gross of expenses related to investments as these expenses are not allocable to specific investments. Investments are considered to be exited when the original investment objective has been achieved through the receipt of cash and/or non-cash consideration upon the repayment of a debt investment or sale of an investment or through the determination that no further consideration was collectible and, thus, a loss may have been realized. Approximately 90.3% of these exited investments resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized internal rate of return to the Company of 10% or greater.\nBecause we are internally managed, we do not pay any external investment advisory fees, but instead directly incur the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals. We believe that our internally managed structure provides us with a beneficial operating expense structure when compared to other publicly traded and privately held investment firms which are externally managed, and our internally managed structure allows us the opportunity to leverage our non-interest operating expenses as we grow our investment portfolio. For the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the ratio of our annualized fourth quarter operating expenses, excluding interest expense, as a percentage of our quarterly average total assets was 2.81%, 3.36% and 4.54%, respectively.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements. We have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows.\nValuation of Investments\nThe most significant determination inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of our investment portfolio and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, our investment portfolio at fair value represented approximately 95.0% and 94.2% of our total assets, respectively. We are required to report our investments at fair value. We follow the provisions of ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is to be sold in the principal market to independent market participants, which may be a hypothetical market. See Note 4 - Fair Value\nMeasurements\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our investment portfolio valuation process and procedures.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process, our determination of fair value for our investment portfolio may differ materially from the values that would have been determined had a ready market for the securities actually existed. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance, and other events may occur over the lives of the investments that may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation.\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value for our investment portfolio and our valuation procedures, consistent with 1940 Act requirements. Our Board of Directors believes that our investment portfolio as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 reflects fair value as of those dates based on the markets in which we operate and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates.\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recognized on the date dividends are declared by the portfolio company or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution. Discounts/premiums received to par on loans purchased are capitalized and accreted or amortized into income over the life of the loan. In accordance with our valuation policy, accrued interest and dividend income is evaluated periodically for collectability. When we do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations, we will generally establish a reserve against interest income receivable, thereby placing the loan or debt security on non-accrual status, and cease to recognize interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due. If a loan or debt security's status significantly improves regarding ability to service debt or other obligations, it will be restored to accrual basis. As of March 31, 2019 we had one investment on non-accrual status, which comprised of approximately 1.6% of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately 1.9% of its cost. As of March 31, 2018, we did not have any investments on non-accrual status.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months. The guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard requires the use of a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. Based on our assessment of the new standard, the single change relates to the recognition of a new right-of-use asset and lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet for our office space operating lease. We currently have one operating lease for office space and do not expect a significant change in our leasing activity between now and adoption. As such, the adoption will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. See further discussion of our operating lease obligation in \"Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements under SAC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the ASC. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new guidance, an entity is required to perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The new guidance will significantly enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures as to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)-Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. This ASU clarified guidance on assessing collectability, presenting sales tax, measuring noncash consideration, and certain transition matters. The new guidance is effective for the annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim\nperiods within that reporting period. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 effective April 1, 2018 and determined that its material financial contracts are excluded from the scope of ASU 2014-09. As a result of the scope exception for financial contracts, the Company's management has determined that there were no material changes to the recognition timing and classification of revenues and expenses; additionally, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a significant impact on pretax income or on the consolidated financial statement disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), which is intended to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein. The Company adopted ASU 2016-15 effective April 1, 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which changes the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC 820. The key provisions include new, eliminated and modified disclosure requirements. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. CSWC is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements, but the impact of the adoption is not expected to be material.\nIn August 2018, the SEC issued the Final Rule Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification, amending certain disclosure requirements that were redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated or superseded. The amendments are intended to facilitate the disclosure of information to investors and simplify compliance. The final rule was effective on November 5, 2018. The Company adopted these disclosure updates in the quarter ended December 31, 2018. The disclosure updates impacted the presentation of the consolidated financial statements by requiring the presentation of the total, rather than the components of the distributable earnings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, the Company updated the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Net Assets for the new interim reporting requirement to disclose the current and comparative year-to-date periods, including subtotals for each interim periods. Management does not consider the impact of these disclosure updates to be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2019, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No. 33-10618, FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, which amends certain SEC disclosure requirements. The amendments are intended to simplify certain disclosure requirements, improve readability and navigability of disclosure documents, and discourage repetition and disclosure of immaterial information. The amendments are effective for all filings submitted on or after May 2, 2019. The Company adopted the requisite amendments effective May 2, 2019. As it pertains to the Company for this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there were no significant changes to the Company's consolidated financial position or disclosures. The Company is still evaluating the impact this amendment will have on its other future periodic filings and registration statements.\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION\nOur LMM investments consist of secured debt, subordinated debt, equity warrants and direct equity investments in privately held, LMM companies based in the United States. Our LMM portfolio companies generally have annual EBITDA between $3.0 million and $15.0 million, and our LMM investments typically range in size from $5.0 million to $25.0 million. The LMM debt investments are typically secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company, generally bear interest at floating rates, and generally have a term of between five and seven years from the original investment date.\nOur UMM investments consist of direct investments in or secondary purchases of interest-bearing debt securities in privately held companies based in the United States that are generally larger in size than the LMM companies included in our portfolio with EBITDA generally greater than $50.0 million. Our UMM investments typically range in size from $5.0 million to $15.0 million. Our UMM debt investments are generally secured by ether a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have a term of between three and seven years from the original investment date.\nThe total value of our investment portfolio was $524.1 million as of March 31, 2019, as compared to $393.1 million as of March 31, 2018. As of March 31, 2019, we had investments in 37 portfolio companies with an aggregate cost of $478.1 million. As of March 31, 2018, we had investments in 30 portfolio companies with an aggregate cost of $335.4 million.\nAs of March 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately $348.2 million, or 94.7%, and $220.3 million, or 92.1%, respectively, of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) bore interest at floating rates, of which 87.8% and 94.2%, respectively, were subject to contractual minimum interest rates. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately $19.5 million, or 5.3%, and $18.8 million, or 7.9%, respectively, of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) bore interest at fixed rates.\nThe following tables provide a summary of our investments in LMM and UMM companies as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 (excluding our investment in I-45 SLF LLC):\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of March 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>LMM (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>UMM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of portfolio companies\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>377,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>325,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of portfolio at cost - debt\n</td> <td>87.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of portfolio at cost - equity\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of debt investments at cost secured by first lien\n</td> <td>76.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average annual effective yield (b)(c)\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average EBITDA (c)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average leverage through CSWC security (c)(d)\n</td> <td>3.3x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8x\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>At March 31, 2019, we had equity ownership in approximately 73.1% of our LMM investments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>The weighted-average annual effective yields were computed using the effective interest rates for all debt investments at cost as of March 31, 2019, including accretion of original issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt instruments and any debt investments on non-accrual status.

When we do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations, we will generally establish a reserve against interest income receivable, thereby placing the loan or debt security on non-accrual status, and cease to recognize interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due.\nAs of March 31, 2019, we had one debt investment on non-accrual status, which comprised of approximately 1.6% of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately 1.9% of its cost.

of Operations is captioned Net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations\u201d and consists of three elements. The first is Net investment income (loss),\u201d which is the difference between income from interest, dividends and fees and our combined operating and interest expenses, net of applicable income taxes. The second element is Net realized gain (loss) on investments before income tax,\u201d which is the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio securities and their stated cost. The third element is the Net change in unrealized appreciation on investments, net of tax\u201d which is the net change in the market or fair value of our investment portfolio, compared with stated cost. It should be noted that the Net realized gain (loss) on investments before income tax\u201d and Net change in unrealized appreciation on investments, net of tax\u201d are directly related in that when an appreciated portfolio security is sold to realize a gain, a corresponding decrease in net unrealized appreciation occurs by transferring the gain associated with the transaction from being unrealized\u201d to being realized.\u201d Conversely, when a loss is realized on a depreciated portfolio security, an increase in net unrealized appreciation occurs.\nComparison of years ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(12,178\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,303\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>(14,945\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,823\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,122\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before taxes\n</td> <td>24,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>1,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>437.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>23,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain on investments before income tax\n</td> <td>20,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,218.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on investments, net of tax\n</td> <td>(11,506\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(153.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in net assets from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,249\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Income\nTotal investment income consisted of interest income, management fees, dividend income and other income for each applicable period. For the year ended March 31, 2019, total investment income was $51.9 million, a $16.8 million, or 47.7%, increase over total investment income of $35.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $15.4 million, or 70.5%, increase in interest income generated from our debt investments due to a 56.2% increase in the cost basis of debt investments held from $236.8 million to $369.8 million year over year. In addition, the weighted average yield on debt investments increased from 11.46% to 11.58%.\nWe received fees and other income of $1.7 million and $0.9 million for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase year over year related primarily to prepayment and amendment fees.\nOperating Expenses\nDue to the nature of our business, the majority of our operating expenses are related to interest and fees on our borrowings, employee compensation (including both cash and share-based compensation), and general and administrative expenses.\nInterest and Fees on our Borrowings\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, total interest expense was $12.2 million, an increase of $7.3 million, as compared to the total interest expense of $4.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $57.6 million in average borrowings on our Credit Facility and an increase of $53.2 million in average borrowings related to the December 2022 Notes outstanding during the year ended March 31, 2019.\nSalaries, General and Administrative Expenses\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, total employee compensation expense (including both cash and share-based compensation) was $10.0 million, a $0.8 million, or 8.1%, increase over total employee compensation expense of $9.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount, as well as additional restricted stock award grants, offset by the Spin-off Compensation Plan, which was fully paid out in 2018. For the year ended March 31, 2019, our total general and administrative expense was $5.0 million, an increase of $0.4 million as compared to the total general and administrative expense of $4.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in board-related expenses due to the addition of a new board member, an increase in insurance costs, and an increase in legal, audit and printing fees relating to maintaining the Company's shelf registration with the SEC.\nNet Investment Income\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, net investment income increased from the prior year by $7.5 million, or 46.1%, to $23.7 million as a result of a $16.8 million increase in total investment income, offset by a $0.9 million increase in income tax expense and a $7.3 million increase in interest expense.\nIncrease in Net Assets from Operations\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we recognized realized gains on investments before income tax totaling $20.9 million, which consisted of gains on the partial repayments of six non-control/non-affiliate debt investments, full repayments of seven non-control/non-affiliate debt investments and the sale of one control, one affiliate and one non-control/non-affiliate equity investment. Realized gains on investments include a realized gain on the sale of TitanLiner, Inc. of $18.6 million and a realized gain on the sale of Deepwater Corrosion Services of $1.7 million.\nIn addition, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we recorded net unrealized depreciation on investments, net of tax, totaling $11.5 million, consisting of net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio of $2.6 million, the reversal of $14.3 million of net unrealized appreciation recognized in prior periods due to the realized gains noted above, and net unrealized appreciation related to deferred tax associated with the Taxable Subsidiary of $0.2 million. Net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio included unrealized gains on Media Recovery, Inc. of $9.6 million, partially offset by unrealized losses on I-45 SLF LLC of $4.6 million and American Teleconferencing Services, Ltd. of $2.9 million. These unrealized gains and losses were due to changes in fair value based on the overall EBITDA performance and cash flows of each investment as determined by our Board of Directors.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, we recognized realized gains on investments before income tax totaling $1.6 million, which consisted of net gains on the partial repayments of five non-control/non-affiliate investments and full repayments of 13 non-control/non-affiliate investments.\nIn addition, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, we recorded net unrealized appreciation, net of tax, on investments totaling $21.5 million, consisting of net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio of $22.0 million, the reversal of $0.6 million of net unrealized appreciation recognized in prior periods due to the realized gains noted above, and net unrealized depreciation related to deferred tax associated with the Taxable Subsidiary of $0.1 million. Net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio included unrealized gains on TitanLiner, Inc. of $20.3 million and Media Recovery, Inc. of $5.3 million, partially offset by unrealized losses on Deepwater Corrosion Services of $5.3 million. These unrealized gains and losses were due to changes in fair value based on the overall EBITDA performance and cash flows of each investment.\nComparison of years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(4,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(989\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,886\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>392.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>(13,823\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,818\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,005\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before taxes\n</td> <td>16,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,584\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(89.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (loss)\n</td> <td>16,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain (loss) on investments before income tax\n</td> <td>1,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,314\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(80.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized appreciation on investments, net of tax\n</td> <td>21,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Income\nTotal investment income consisted of interest income, management fees, dividend income and other income for each applicable period. For the year ended March 31, 2018, total investment income was $35.1 million, an $11.7 million, or 49.6%, increase over total investment income of $23.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $9.4 million, or 76.0%, increase in interest income generated from our debt investments due to a 42.6% increase in the cost basis of debt investments held from $166.1 million to $236.8 million year over year in addition to an increase in the weighted average yield on debt investments from 10.28% to 11.46%.\nWe receive management fees primarily from our controlled affiliate investments which aggregated $0.4 million for both the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. We also received other miscellaneous fees and income of approximately $0.5 million and $0.6 million during the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related primarily to other portfolio company activity.\nOperating Expenses\nDue to the nature of our business, the majority of our operating expenses are related to interest and fees on our borrowings, employee compensation (including both cash and share-based compensation), and general and administrative expenses.\nInterest and Fees on our Borrowings\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, total interest expense was $4.9 million, an increase of $3.9 million as compared to the total interest expense of $1.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $24.4 million in average borrowings on our Credit Facility during the year ended March 31, 2018, as well as an increase of$57.5 million in December 2022 Notes outstanding.\nSalaries, General and Administrative Expenses\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, total employee compensation expense (including both cash and share-based compensation) was $9.2 million, a $1.0 million, or 12.4%, increase over total employee compensation expense of $8.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount, as well as additional restricted stock award grants. For both the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, total general and administrative expense was $4.6 million.\nNet Investment Income/Loss\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, net investment income was $16.2 million, a $8.3 million, or 105.8%, increase over net investment income of $7.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The increase was driven by an $11.7 million increase in total investment income and a $1.6 million decrease in income tax expense primarily due to the tax reform, offset by a $3.9 million increase in interest expense and a $1.0 million increase in employee compensation expense.\nIncrease/Decrease in Net Assets from Operations\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we recognized realized gains on investments before income tax totaling $7.9 million, which consisted of net gains on the partial repayments of 22 non-control/non-affiliate investments, full repayments on five non-control/non-affiliate investments and the sale of certain equity securities.\nIn addition, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we recorded net unrealized appreciation, net of tax, on investments totaling $7.7 million, consisting of net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio of $12.5 million, the reversal of $4.5 million of net unrealized appreciation recognized in prior periods due to the realized gains noted above, and net unrealized depreciation related to deferred tax associated with the Taxable Subsidiary of $0.3 million. Net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio included unrealized gains on Media Recovery, Inc. of $5.6 million, Deepwater Corrosion Services, Inc. of $4.9 million and I-45 SLF LLC of $3.1 million, partially offset by unrealized losses on TitanLiner, Inc. of $3.3 million. These unrealized gains and losses were due to changes in fair value based on the overall EBITDA performance and cash flows of each investment.\nFINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from cash flows from operations, the net proceeds of public offerings of debt securities and advances from the Credit Facility. Management believes that the Company's cash and cash equivalents, cash available from investments, and commitments under the Credit Facility are adequate to meet its needs for the next twelve months.\nCash Flows\nAt March 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $9.9 million. For the year ended March 31, 2019, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $2.0 million. During that period, our operating activities used $94.7 million in cash, consisting primarily of new portfolio investments of $229.6 million, partially offset by $74.7 million of repayments received from debt investments in portfolio companies and $33.9 million of proceeds from sales of equity investments. In addition, our financing activities increased cash by $96.7 million, consisting primarily of net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $101.0 million, proceeds from the issuance of the December 2022 Notes of $19.5 million and proceeds from the offering of common stock of $18.9 million, partially offset by cash dividends paid in the amount of $42.5 million.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $7.9 million. For the year ended March 31, 2018, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $14.5 million. During that period, our operating activities used $63.9 million in cash, consisting primarily of new portfolio investments of $166.2 million, partially offset by $82.5 million of repayments received from debt investments in portfolio companies. In addition, our financing activities increased cash by $49.4 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of the December 2022 Notes of $55.8 million and net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $15.0 million, partially offset by cash dividends paid in the amount of $18.6 million.\nFinancing Transactions\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limitations, the Company is only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage (i.e., the ratio of assets less liabilities not represented by senior securities to senior securities such as borrowings), calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, is at least 200% (or, pursuant to the 1940 Act, 150% if certain requirements are met as described in the Business Section under Regulation as a Business Development Company-Senior Securities\u201d) after such borrowing. On April 25, 2018, the Board of Directors unanimously approved the application of the recently modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to the Company was decreased from 200% to 150%, which became effective April 25, 2019. Additionally, the Board of Directors also approved a resolution which limits the Company's issuance of senior securities such that the asset coverage ratio, taking into account any such issuance, would not be less than 166%, at any time after the effective date. As of March 31, 2019, the Company's asset coverage was 249%.\nCredit Facility\nIn August 2016, CSWC entered into a senior secured credit facility (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Facility\u201d) to provide additional liquidity to support its investment and operational activities, which included total commitments of $100 million. The Credit Facility contained an accordion feature that allowed CSWC to increase the total commitments under the Credit Facility up to $150 million from new and existing lenders on the same terms and\nconditions as the existing commitments. In August 2017, we increased our total commitments by $15 million through adding an additional lender using the accordion feature.\nOn November 16, 2017, CSWC entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Amendment\u201d) to its Credit Facility. Prior to the Amendment, borrowings under the Credit Facility accrued interest on a per annum basis at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate plus 3.25% with no LIBOR floor. CSWC paid unused commitment fees of 0.50% to 1.50% per annum, based on utilization, on the unused lender commitments under the Credit Facility. The Amendment (1) increased the total borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility to $180 million, with commitments from a diversified group of eight lenders, (2) increased the Credit Facility's accordion feature that allows for an increase in total commitments of up to $250 million under the Credit Facility from new and existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments, (3) reduced the interest rate on borrowings from LIBOR plus 3.25% down to LIBOR plus 3.00%, with a further step-down to LIBOR plus 2.75% at the time the Company's net worth exceeds $325 million, (4) reduced unused commitment fees from a utilization-based grid of 0.50% to 1.5% down to a range of 0.50% to 1.0% per annum, and (5) extended the Credit Facility's revolving period that ended on August 30, 2019 through November 16, 2020. Additionally, the final maturity of the Credit Facility was extended from August 30, 2020 to November 16, 2021. On April 16, 2018 and May 11, 2018, CSWC entered into Incremental Assumption Agreements, which increased the total commitments under the Credit Facility by $20 million and $10 million, respectively. The increases were executed in accordance with the accordion feature of the Credit Facility, increasing total commitments from $180 million to $210 million.\nOn December 21, 2018, CSWC entered into the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\"), and a related Amended and Restated Guarantee, Pledge and Security Agreement, to amend and restate its Credit Facility. The Credit Agreement (1) increased the total commitments by $60 million from $210 million to an aggregate total of $270 million, provided by a diversified group of nine lenders, (2) increased the Credit Facility's accordion feature to $350 million under the Credit Facility from new and existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments, (3) reduced the interest rate on borrowings from LIBOR plus 3.00% to LIBOR plus 2.50%, subject to certain conditions as outlined in the Credit Agreement, (4) reduced the minimum asset coverage with respect to senior securities representing indebtedness from 200% to 150% after the date on which such minimum asset coverage is permitted to be reduced by the Company under applicable law, subject to certain conditions as outlined in the Credit Agreement, and (5) extended the Credit Facility's revolving period from November 16, 2020 to December 21, 2022 and the final maturity from November 16, 2021 to December 21, 2023.\nThe Credit Agreement modified certain covenants in the Credit Facility, including: (1) to provide for a minimum senior coverage ratio of 2-to-1 (in addition to the asset coverage ratio noted below), (2) to increase the minimum obligors' net worth test from $160 million to $180 million, (3) to reduce the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio from 2.50-to-1 to 2.25-to-1 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and (4) to provide for the fact that the Company will not declare or pay a dividend or distribution in cash or other property unless immediately prior to and after giving effect thereto the Company's asset coverage ratio exceeds 150% (and certain other conditions are satisfied). The Credit Facility also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to: (1) certain reporting requirements, (2) maintaining RIC and BDC status, (3) maintaining a minimum shareholders' equity, (4) maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth, and (5) at any time the outstanding advances exceed 90% of the borrowing base, maintaining a minimum liquidity of not less than 10% of the covered debt amount.\nThe Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, nonpayment, misrepresentation of representations and warranties in a material respect, breach of covenant, bankruptcy, and change of control, with customary cure and notice provisions. If the Company defaults on its obligations under the Credit Facility, the lenders may have the right to foreclose upon and sell, or otherwise transfer, the collateral subject to their security interests. There are no changes to the covenants or the events of default in the Credit Facility as a result of the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Facility is secured by (1) substantially all of the present and future property and assets of the Company and the guarantors and (2) 100% of the equity interests in the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2019, substantially all of the Company's assets were pledged as collateral for the Credit Facility.\nAt March 31, 2019, CSWC had $141.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. CSWC recognized interest expense related to the Credit Facility, including unused commitment fees and amortization of deferred loan costs of $7.3 million and $3.7 million, respectively, for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. The weighted average interest rate on the Credit Facility was 5.41% and 4.66%, respectively, for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. Average borrowings for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were $99.8 million and $42.2 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, CSWC was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Facility.\nDecember 2022 Notes\nIn December 2017, the Company issued $57.5 million in aggregate principal amount, including the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional principal amounts to cover over-allotments, of 5.95% Notes due 2022 (the December 2022 Notes\u201d). The December 2022 Notes mature on December 15, 2022 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time, or from time to time, at the Company's option on or after December 15, 2019. The December 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.95% per year, payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2018. The December 2022 Notes are an unsecured obligation, rank pari passu with our other outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, including borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nOn June 11, 2018, the Company entered into an \"At-The-Market\" (\"ATM\") debt distribution agreement, pursuant to which it may offer for sale, from time to time, up to $50 million in aggregate principal amount of December 2022 Notes through B. Riley FBR, Inc., acting as its sales agent (the 2022 Notes Agent\u201d). Sales of the December 2022 Notes may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be \"at the market offerings\" as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, or similar securities exchanges or sales made through a market maker other than on an exchange at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.\nThe 2022 Notes Agent receives a commission from the Company equal to up to 2% of the gross sales of any December 2022 Notes sold through the 2022 Notes Agent under the debt distribution agreement. The 2022 Notes Agent is not required to sell any specific principal amount of December 2022 Notes, but will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its sales and trading practices to sell the December 2022 Notes. The December 2022 Notes trade flat,\u201d which means that purchasers in the secondary market will not pay, and sellers will not receive, any accrued and unpaid interest on the December 2022 Notes that is not reflected in the trading price.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company sold 785,447 December 2022 Notes for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $19.6 million at a weighted average effective yield of 5.86%. At this time, the Company does not intend to issue additional December 2022 Notes under this ATM debt distribution agreement.\nAll issuances of December 2022 Notes rank equally in right of payment and form a single series of notes.\nAs of March 31, 2019, the carrying amount of the December 2022 Notes was $75.1 million. As of March 31, 2019, the fair value of the December 2022 Notes was $78.7 million. The fair value is based on the closing price of the security of The Nasdaq Global Select Market, which is a Level 1 input under ASC 820. The Company recognized interest expense related to the December 2022 Notes, including amortization of deferred issuance costs, of $4.8 million and $1.2 million for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Average borrowings for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were $70.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively.\nThe indenture governing the December 2022 Notes contains certain covenants including but not limited to (i) a requirement that the Company comply with the asset coverage requirement of Section 18(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions thereto, after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to the Company by the SEC, (ii) a requirement, subject to a limited exception, that the Company will not declare any cash dividend, or declare any other cash distribution, upon a class of its capital stock, or purchase any such capital stock, unless, in every such case, at the time of the declaration of any such dividend or distribution, or at the time of any such purchase, the Company has the minimum asset coverage required pursuant to Section 18(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act or any successor provision thereto after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase price, as the case may be, giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to the Company by the SEC and (iii) a requirement to provide financial information to the holders of the December 2022 Notes and the trustee under the indenture if the Company should no longer be subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. The indenture and supplement relating to the December 2022 Notes also provides for customary events of default. As of March 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the December 2022 Notes.\nEquity Capital Activities\nIn January 2016, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $10 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with guidelines specified in Rules 10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(B) and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. During the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company repurchased a total of 10,452 shares at an average price of $17.72 per share, including commissions paid. As of March 31, 2019, we had repurchased a total of 46,363 shares of our common stock in the open market\nunder the stock repurchase program, at an average price of $16.67, including commissions paid, leaving approximately $9.2 million available for additional repurchases under the program.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company completed an offering of 700,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a net price of $18.90 per share, which was above NAV per share at the time of the offering. The Company issued 100,000 shares of its common stock to certain institutional investors in a direct registered offering and 600,000 shares of its common stock in a \"best efforts\" underwritten offering. The total net proceeds of the offerings, before expenses, was approximately $13.2 million.\nOn March 4, 2019, the Company entered into separate equity distribution agreements with certain sales agents pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50,000,000 (the \"Equity ATM Program\"). During the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company sold 263,656 shares of its common stock under the Equity ATM Program at a weighted-average price of $21.47 per share, raising $5.7 million of gross proceeds. Net proceeds were $5.5 million after commissions to the sales agents on shares sold.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities through existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated through our ongoing operating activities, utilization of available borrowings under our Credit Facility and future issuances of debt and equity on terms we believe are favorable to the Company and our shareholders. Our primary uses of funds will be investments in portfolio companies and operating expenses.\nIn order to satisfy the Code requirements applicable to a RIC, we intend to distribute to our shareholders, after consideration and application of our ability under the Code to carry forward certain excess undistributed taxable income from one tax year into the next tax year, substantially all of our taxable income.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and fund equity capital and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet.\nAt March 31, 2019 and 2018, we had a total of approximately $17.7 million and $11.6 million, respectively, in currently unfunded commitments (as discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As of March 31, 2019, the total unfunded commitments included commitments to issue letters of credit through a financial intermediary on behalf of certain portfolio companies. As of March 31, 2019, we had $3.4 million in letters of credit issued and outstanding under these commitments on behalf of the portfolio companies. For the letters of credit issued and outstanding, we would be required to make payments to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment obligations. Of these letters of credit, $3.4 million expire in May 2020. As of March 31, 2019, none of the letters of credit issued and outstanding were recorded as a liability on the Company's balance sheet as such letters of credit are considered in the valuation of the investments in the portfolio company.\nThe Company believes its assets will provide adequate coverage to satisfy these commitments. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $9.9 million and $125.6 million in available borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nContractual Obligations\nAs shown below, we had the following contractual obligations as of March 31, 2019.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Statements we make in the following discussion which express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors, including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the headings Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an internally managed closed-end, non-diversified investment company that has been elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We specialize in providing customized debt and equity financing to LMM companies and debt capital to UMM companies in a broad range of investment segments located primarily in the United States. Our investment objective is to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity and equity related investments. Our investment strategy is to partner with business owners, management teams and financial sponsors to provide flexible financing solutions to fund growth, changes of control, or other corporate events. We invest primarily in senior debt securities, secured by security interests in portfolio company assets, and in secured and unsecured subordinated debt securities. We also invest in equity interests in our portfolio companies alongside our debt securities.\nWe focus on investing in companies with histories of generating revenues and positive cash flow, established market positions and proven management teams with strong operating discipline. We target senior debt, subordinated debt, and equity investments in LMM companies, as well as first and second lien syndicated loans in UMM companies. Our target LMM companies\ntypically have annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) between $3.0 million and $15.0 million, and our LMM investments generally range in size from $5.0 million to $25.0 million. Our UMM investments generally include syndicated first and second lien loans in companies with EBITDA generally greater than $50.0 million, and our UMM investments typically range in size from $5.0 million to $15.0 million.\nWe seek to fill the financing gap for LMM companies, which, historically, have had more limited access to financing from commercial banks and other traditional sources. The underserved nature of the LMM creates the opportunity for us to meet the financing needs of LMM companies while also negotiating favorable transaction terms and equity participations. Our ability to invest across a LMM company's capital structure, from secured loans to equity securities, allows us to offer portfolio companies a comprehensive suite of financing options. Providing customized financing solutions is important to LMM companies. We generally seek to partner directly with financial sponsors, entrepreneurs, management teams and business owners in making our investments. Our LMM debt investments typically include senior loans with a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company, as well as subordinated debt which may either be secured or unsecured subordinated loans. Our LMM debt investments typically have a term of between five and seven years from the original investment date. We also often seek to invest in the equity securities of our LMM portfolio companies.\nOur investments in UMM companies primarily consist of direct investments in or secondary purchases of interest bearing debt securities in privately held companies that are generally larger in size than the LMM companies included in our portfolio. Our UMM debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have an expected duration of between three and seven years from the original investment date.\nSince the Share Distribution on September 30, 2015 through March 31, 2019, our exited investments resulted in a weighted average internal rate of return to the Company of approximately 18.2% (based on original cash invested of approximately $165.0 million). Internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows related to a particular investment equal to zero. Internal rate of return is gross of expenses related to investments as these expenses are not allocable to specific investments. Investments are considered to be exited when the original investment objective has been achieved through the receipt of cash and/or non-cash consideration upon the repayment of a debt investment or sale of an investment or through the determination that no further consideration was collectible and, thus, a loss may have been realized. Approximately 90.3% of these exited investments resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized internal rate of return to the Company of 10% or greater.\nBecause we are internally managed, we do not pay any external investment advisory fees, but instead directly incur the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals. We believe that our internally managed structure provides us with a beneficial operating expense structure when compared to other publicly traded and privately held investment firms which are externally managed, and our internally managed structure allows us the opportunity to leverage our non-interest operating expenses as we grow our investment portfolio. For the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the ratio of our annualized fourth quarter operating expenses, excluding interest expense, as a percentage of our quarterly average total assets was 2.81%, 3.36% and 4.54%, respectively.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements. We have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows.\nValuation of Investments\nThe most significant determination inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of our investment portfolio and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, our investment portfolio at fair value represented approximately 95.0% and 94.2% of our total assets, respectively. We are required to report our investments at fair value. We follow the provisions of ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is to be sold in the principal market to independent market participants, which may be a hypothetical market. See Note 4 - Fair Value\nMeasurements\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our investment portfolio valuation process and procedures.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process, our determination of fair value for our investment portfolio may differ materially from the values that would have been determined had a ready market for the securities actually existed. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance, and other events may occur over the lives of the investments that may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation.\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value for our investment portfolio and our valuation procedures, consistent with 1940 Act requirements. Our Board of Directors believes that our investment portfolio as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 reflects fair value as of those dates based on the markets in which we operate and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates.\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recognized on the date dividends are declared by the portfolio company or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution. Discounts/premiums received to par on loans purchased are capitalized and accreted or amortized into income over the life of the loan. In accordance with our valuation policy, accrued interest and dividend income is evaluated periodically for collectability. When we do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations, we will generally establish a reserve against interest income receivable, thereby placing the loan or debt security on non-accrual status, and cease to recognize interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due. If a loan or debt security's status significantly improves regarding ability to service debt or other obligations, it will be restored to accrual basis. As of March 31, 2019 we had one investment on non-accrual status, which comprised of approximately 1.6% of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately 1.9% of its cost. As of March 31, 2018, we did not have any investments on non-accrual status.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months. The guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard requires the use of a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. Based on our assessment of the new standard, the single change relates to the recognition of a new right-of-use asset and lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet for our office space operating lease. We currently have one operating lease for office space and do not expect a significant change in our leasing activity between now and adoption. As such, the adoption will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. See further discussion of our operating lease obligation in \"Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements under SAC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the ASC. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new guidance, an entity is required to perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The new guidance will significantly enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures as to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)-Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. This ASU clarified guidance on assessing collectability, presenting sales tax, measuring noncash consideration, and certain transition matters. The new guidance is effective for the annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim\nperiods within that reporting period. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 effective April 1, 2018 and determined that its material financial contracts are excluded from the scope of ASU 2014-09. As a result of the scope exception for financial contracts, the Company's management has determined that there were no material changes to the recognition timing and classification of revenues and expenses; additionally, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a significant impact on pretax income or on the consolidated financial statement disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), which is intended to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein. The Company adopted ASU 2016-15 effective April 1, 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which changes the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC 820. The key provisions include new, eliminated and modified disclosure requirements. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. CSWC is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements, but the impact of the adoption is not expected to be material.\nIn August 2018, the SEC issued the Final Rule Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification, amending certain disclosure requirements that were redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated or superseded. The amendments are intended to facilitate the disclosure of information to investors and simplify compliance. The final rule was effective on November 5, 2018. The Company adopted these disclosure updates in the quarter ended December 31, 2018. The disclosure updates impacted the presentation of the consolidated financial statements by requiring the presentation of the total, rather than the components of the distributable earnings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, the Company updated the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Net Assets for the new interim reporting requirement to disclose the current and comparative year-to-date periods, including subtotals for each interim periods. Management does not consider the impact of these disclosure updates to be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2019, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No. 33-10618, FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, which amends certain SEC disclosure requirements. The amendments are intended to simplify certain disclosure requirements, improve readability and navigability of disclosure documents, and discourage repetition and disclosure of immaterial information. The amendments are effective for all filings submitted on or after May 2, 2019. The Company adopted the requisite amendments effective May 2, 2019. As it pertains to the Company for this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there were no significant changes to the Company's consolidated financial position or disclosures. The Company is still evaluating the impact this amendment will have on its other future periodic filings and registration statements.\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION\nOur LMM investments consist of secured debt, subordinated debt, equity warrants and direct equity investments in privately held, LMM companies based in the United States. Our LMM portfolio companies generally have annual EBITDA between $3.0 million and $15.0 million, and our LMM investments typically range in size from $5.0 million to $25.0 million. The LMM debt investments are typically secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company, generally bear interest at floating rates, and generally have a term of between five and seven years from the original investment date.\nOur UMM investments consist of direct investments in or secondary purchases of interest-bearing debt securities in privately held companies based in the United States that are generally larger in size than the LMM companies included in our portfolio with EBITDA generally greater than $50.0 million. Our UMM investments typically range in size from $5.0 million to $15.0 million. Our UMM debt investments are generally secured by ether a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have a term of between three and seven years from the original investment date.\nThe total value of our investment portfolio was $524.1 million as of March 31, 2019, as compared to $393.1 million as of March 31, 2018. As of March 31, 2019, we had investments in 37 portfolio companies with an aggregate cost of $478.1 million. As of March 31, 2018, we had investments in 30 portfolio companies with an aggregate cost of $335.4 million.\nAs of March 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately $348.2 million, or 94.7%, and $220.3 million, or 92.1%, respectively, of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) bore interest at floating rates, of which 87.8% and 94.2%, respectively, were subject to contractual minimum interest rates. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately $19.5 million, or 5.3%, and $18.8 million, or 7.9%, respectively, of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) bore interest at fixed rates.\nThe following tables provide a summary of our investments in LMM and UMM companies as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 (excluding our investment in I-45 SLF LLC):\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of March 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>LMM (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>UMM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of portfolio companies\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>377,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>325,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of portfolio at cost - debt\n</td> <td>87.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of portfolio at cost - equity\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of debt investments at cost secured by first lien\n</td> <td>76.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average annual effective yield (b)(c)\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average EBITDA (c)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average leverage through CSWC security (c)(d)\n</td> <td>3.3x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8x\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) At March 31, 2019, we had equity ownership in approximately 73.1% of our LMM investments. \n (b) The weighted-average annual effective yields were computed using the effective interest rates for all debt investments at cost as of March 31, 2019, including accretion of original issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt instruments and any debt investments on non-accrual status.

Management uses this metric as a guide to evaluate the relative risk of its position in each portfolio debt investment. \nAs of March 31, 2019 and 2018, our investment portfolio consisted of the following investments:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Portfolio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>at Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>at Cost\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2019:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First lien loans1\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>317,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>319,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien loans2\n</td> <td>35,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt\n</td> <td>14,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred equity\n</td> <td>17,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity & warrants\n</td> <td>72,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>I-45 SLF LLC3\n</td> <td>65,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>524,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>478,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2018:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>First lien loans1\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>194,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Second lien loans2\n</td> <td>23,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated debt\n</td> <td>18,783\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred equity\n</td> <td>36,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity & warrants\n</td> <td>50,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>I-45 SLF LLC3\n</td> <td>67,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>393,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>335,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n 1 Included in first lien loans are loans structured as first lien last out loans. These loans may in certain cases be subordinated in payment priority to other senior secured lenders. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of the first lien last out loans are $38.6 million and $26.9 million, respectively. \n 2 Included in second lien loans are loans structured as split lien term loans. These loans provide the Company with a first lien priority on certain assets of the obligor and a second lien priority on different assets of the obligor. As of March 31, 2019 , the fair value of the split lien term loans are $18.3 million. As of March 31, 2018, there were no investments in split lien term loans. \n 3 I-45 SLF LLC is a joint venture between CSWC and Main Street Capital. This entity primarily invests in syndicated senior secured loans in the UMM. The portfolio companies held by I-45 SLF LLC represent a diverse set of industry classifications, which are similar to those in which CSWC invests directly. We own 80.0% of I-45 SLF LLC and have a profits interest of 75.6%, while Main Street Capital owns 20.0% and has a profits interest of 24.4%. I-45 SLF LLC's Board of Managers makes all investment and operational decisions for the fund, and consists of equal representation from our Company and Main Street Capital. The Company does not guarantee or otherwise obligate itself to make payments on debts owed by I-45 SLF LLC. \nPortfolio Asset Quality\nWe utilize an internally developed investment rating system to rate the performance and monitor the expected level of returns for each debt investment in our portfolio. The investment rating system takes into account both quantitative and qualitative factors of the portfolio company and the investments held therein, including each investment's expected level of returns and the collectability of our debt investments, comparisons to competitors and other industry participants and the portfolio company's future outlook. The ratings are not intended to reflect the performance or expected level of returns of our equity investments.\n \u2022 Investment Rating 1 represents the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The investment is performing materially above underwriting expectations and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. \n \u2022 Investment Rating 2 indicates the investment is performing as expected at the time of underwriting and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable to neutral. \n \u2022 Investment Rating 3 involves an investment performing below underwriting expectations and the trends and risk factors are generally neutral to negative. The portfolio company or investment may be out of compliance with financial covenants and interest payments may be impaired, however principal payments are generally not past due. \n \u2022 Investment Rating 4 indicates that the investment is performing materially below underwriting expectations, the trends and risk factors are generally negative and the risk of the investment has increased substantially. Interest and principal payments on our investment are likely to be impaired. \nThe following table shows the distribution of our debt portfolio investments on the 1 to 4 investment rating scale at fair value as of March 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of March 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Investments at\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Rating\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt Portfolio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>284,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3\n</td> <td>21,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>367,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of March 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Investments at\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Rating\n</td> <td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt Portfolio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2\n</td> <td>217,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3\n</td> <td>12,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>239,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest and dividend income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected. When we do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations, we will generally establish a reserve against interest income receivable, thereby placing the loan or debt security on non-accrual status, and cease to recognize interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due.\nAs of March 31, 2019, we had one debt investment on non-accrual status, which comprised of approximately 1.6% of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately 1.9% of its cost. As of March 31, 2018, we did not have any investments on non-accrual status.\nInvestment Activity\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, we made new debt investments in 13 portfolio companies totaling $173.7 million, follow-on debt investments in 10 portfolio companies totaling $32.8 million, and equity investments in three existing and seven new portfolio companies totaling $19.9 million. We also funded $3.2 million on our existing equity commitment to I-45 SLF LLC. We received contractual principal repayments totaling approximately $10.3 million and full prepayments of approximately $36.1 million from eight portfolio companies. In addition, we received proceeds from sales of investments totaling $63.3 million and recognized net realized gains on those sales totaling $20.4 million.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2018, we made new debt investments in 14 portfolio companies totaling $142.9 million, follow-on debt investments in four portfolio companies totaling $9.4 million, and equity investments in one existing and seven new portfolio companies totaling $9.8 million. We also funded $4.0 million on our existing equity commitment to I-45 SLF LLC.

of Operations is captioned Net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations\u201d and consists of three elements. The first is Net investment income (loss),\u201d which is the difference between income from interest, dividends and fees and our combined operating and interest expenses, net of applicable income taxes. The second element is Net realized gain (loss) on investments before income tax,\u201d which is the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio securities and their stated cost. The third element is the Net change in unrealized appreciation on investments, net of tax\u201d which is the net change in the market or fair value of our investment portfolio, compared with stated cost. It should be noted that the Net realized gain (loss) on investments before income tax\u201d and Net change in unrealized appreciation on investments, net of tax\u201d are directly related in that when an appreciated portfolio security is sold to realize a gain, a corresponding decrease in net unrealized appreciation occurs by transferring the gain associated with the transaction from being unrealized\u201d to being realized.\u201d Conversely, when a loss is realized on a depreciated portfolio security, an increase in net unrealized appreciation occurs.\nComparison of years ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(12,178\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,303\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>(14,945\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,823\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,122\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before taxes\n</td> <td>24,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>1,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>437.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>23,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain on investments before income tax\n</td> <td>20,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,218.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized (depreciation) appreciation on investments, net of tax\n</td> <td>(11,506\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,998\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(153.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in net assets from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,249\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Income\nTotal investment income consisted of interest income, management fees, dividend income and other income for each applicable period. For the year ended March 31, 2019, total investment income was $51.9 million, a $16.8 million, or 47.7%, increase over total investment income of $35.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $15.4 million, or 70.5%, increase in interest income generated from our debt investments due to a 56.2% increase in the cost basis of debt investments held from $236.8 million to $369.8 million year over year. In addition, the weighted average yield on debt investments increased from 11.46% to 11.58%.\nWe received fees and other income of $1.7 million and $0.9 million for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase year over year related primarily to prepayment and amendment fees.\nOperating Expenses\nDue to the nature of our business, the majority of our operating expenses are related to interest and fees on our borrowings, employee compensation (including both cash and share-based compensation), and general and administrative expenses.\nInterest and Fees on our Borrowings\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, total interest expense was $12.2 million, an increase of $7.3 million, as compared to the total interest expense of $4.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $57.6 million in average borrowings on our Credit Facility and an increase of $53.2 million in average borrowings related to the December 2022 Notes outstanding during the year ended March 31, 2019.\nSalaries, General and Administrative Expenses\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, total employee compensation expense (including both cash and share-based compensation) was $10.0 million, a $0.8 million, or 8.1%, increase over total employee compensation expense of $9.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount, as well as additional restricted stock award grants, offset by the Spin-off Compensation Plan, which was fully paid out in 2018. For the year ended March 31, 2019, our total general and administrative expense was $5.0 million, an increase of $0.4 million as compared to the total general and administrative expense of $4.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in board-related expenses due to the addition of a new board member, an increase in insurance costs, and an increase in legal, audit and printing fees relating to maintaining the Company's shelf registration with the SEC.\nNet Investment Income\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, net investment income increased from the prior year by $7.5 million, or 46.1%, to $23.7 million as a result of a $16.8 million increase in total investment income, offset by a $0.9 million increase in income tax expense and a $7.3 million increase in interest expense.\nIncrease in Net Assets from Operations\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we recognized realized gains on investments before income tax totaling $20.9 million, which consisted of gains on the partial repayments of six non-control/non-affiliate debt investments, full repayments of seven non-control/non-affiliate debt investments and the sale of one control, one affiliate and one non-control/non-affiliate equity investment. Realized gains on investments include a realized gain on the sale of TitanLiner, Inc. of $18.6 million and a realized gain on the sale of Deepwater Corrosion Services of $1.7 million.\nIn addition, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we recorded net unrealized depreciation on investments, net of tax, totaling $11.5 million, consisting of net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio of $2.6 million, the reversal of $14.3 million of net unrealized appreciation recognized in prior periods due to the realized gains noted above, and net unrealized appreciation related to deferred tax associated with the Taxable Subsidiary of $0.2 million. Net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio included unrealized gains on Media Recovery, Inc. of $9.6 million, partially offset by unrealized losses on I-45 SLF LLC of $4.6 million and American Teleconferencing Services, Ltd. of $2.9 million. These unrealized gains and losses were due to changes in fair value based on the overall EBITDA performance and cash flows of each investment as determined by our Board of Directors.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, we recognized realized gains on investments before income tax totaling $1.6 million, which consisted of net gains on the partial repayments of five non-control/non-affiliate investments and full repayments of 13 non-control/non-affiliate investments.\nIn addition, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, we recorded net unrealized appreciation, net of tax, on investments totaling $21.5 million, consisting of net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio of $22.0 million, the reversal of $0.6 million of net unrealized appreciation recognized in prior periods due to the realized gains noted above, and net unrealized depreciation related to deferred tax associated with the Taxable Subsidiary of $0.1 million. Net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio included unrealized gains on TitanLiner, Inc. of $20.3 million and Media Recovery, Inc. of $5.3 million, partially offset by unrealized losses on Deepwater Corrosion Services of $5.3 million. These unrealized gains and losses were due to changes in fair value based on the overall EBITDA performance and cash flows of each investment.\nComparison of years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(4,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(989\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,886\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>392.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>(13,823\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,818\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,005\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before taxes\n</td> <td>16,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,584\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(89.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income (loss)\n</td> <td>16,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gain (loss) on investments before income tax\n</td> <td>1,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,314\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(80.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net unrealized appreciation on investments, net of tax\n</td> <td>21,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment Income\nTotal investment income consisted of interest income, management fees, dividend income and other income for each applicable period. For the year ended March 31, 2018, total investment income was $35.1 million, an $11.7 million, or 49.6%, increase over total investment income of $23.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $9.4 million, or 76.0%, increase in interest income generated from our debt investments due to a 42.6% increase in the cost basis of debt investments held from $166.1 million to $236.8 million year over year in addition to an increase in the weighted average yield on debt investments from 10.28% to 11.46%.\nWe receive management fees primarily from our controlled affiliate investments which aggregated $0.4 million for both the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. We also received other miscellaneous fees and income of approximately $0.5 million and $0.6 million during the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related primarily to other portfolio company activity.\nOperating Expenses\nDue to the nature of our business, the majority of our operating expenses are related to interest and fees on our borrowings, employee compensation (including both cash and share-based compensation), and general and administrative expenses.\nInterest and Fees on our Borrowings\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, total interest expense was $4.9 million, an increase of $3.9 million as compared to the total interest expense of $1.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $24.4 million in average borrowings on our Credit Facility during the year ended March 31, 2018, as well as an increase of$57.5 million in December 2022 Notes outstanding.\nSalaries, General and Administrative Expenses\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, total employee compensation expense (including both cash and share-based compensation) was $9.2 million, a $1.0 million, or 12.4%, increase over total employee compensation expense of $8.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount, as well as additional restricted stock award grants. For both the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, total general and administrative expense was $4.6 million.\nNet Investment Income/Loss\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, net investment income was $16.2 million, a $8.3 million, or 105.8%, increase over net investment income of $7.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The increase was driven by an $11.7 million increase in total investment income and a $1.6 million decrease in income tax expense primarily due to the tax reform, offset by a $3.9 million increase in interest expense and a $1.0 million increase in employee compensation expense.\nIncrease/Decrease in Net Assets from Operations\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we recognized realized gains on investments before income tax totaling $7.9 million, which consisted of net gains on the partial repayments of 22 non-control/non-affiliate investments, full repayments on five non-control/non-affiliate investments and the sale of certain equity securities.\nIn addition, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we recorded net unrealized appreciation, net of tax, on investments totaling $7.7 million, consisting of net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio of $12.5 million, the reversal of $4.5 million of net unrealized appreciation recognized in prior periods due to the realized gains noted above, and net unrealized depreciation related to deferred tax associated with the Taxable Subsidiary of $0.3 million. Net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio included unrealized gains on Media Recovery, Inc. of $5.6 million, Deepwater Corrosion Services, Inc. of $4.9 million and I-45 SLF LLC of $3.1 million, partially offset by unrealized losses on TitanLiner, Inc. of $3.3 million. These unrealized gains and losses were due to changes in fair value based on the overall EBITDA performance and cash flows of each investment.\nFINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from cash flows from operations, the net proceeds of public offerings of debt securities and advances from the Credit Facility. Management believes that the Company's cash and cash equivalents, cash available from investments, and commitments under the Credit Facility are adequate to meet its needs for the next twelve months.\nCash Flows\nAt March 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $9.9 million. For the year ended March 31, 2019, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $2.0 million. During that period, our operating activities used $94.7 million in cash, consisting primarily of new portfolio investments of $229.6 million, partially offset by $74.7 million of repayments received from debt investments in portfolio companies and $33.9 million of proceeds from sales of equity investments. In addition, our financing activities increased cash by $96.7 million, consisting primarily of net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $101.0 million, proceeds from the issuance of the December 2022 Notes of $19.5 million and proceeds from the offering of common stock of $18.9 million, partially offset by cash dividends paid in the amount of $42.5 million.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $7.9 million. For the year ended March 31, 2018, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $14.5 million. During that period, our operating activities used $63.9 million in cash, consisting primarily of new portfolio investments of $166.2 million, partially offset by $82.5 million of repayments received from debt investments in portfolio companies. In addition, our financing activities increased cash by $49.4 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of the December 2022 Notes of $55.8 million and net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $15.0 million, partially offset by cash dividends paid in the amount of $18.6 million.\nFinancing Transactions\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limitations, the Company is only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage (i.e., the ratio of assets less liabilities not represented by senior securities to senior securities such as borrowings), calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, is at least 200% (or, pursuant to the 1940 Act, 150% if certain requirements are met as described in the Business Section under Regulation as a Business Development Company-Senior Securities\u201d) after such borrowing. On April 25, 2018, the Board of Directors unanimously approved the application of the recently modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to the Company was decreased from 200% to 150%, which became effective April 25, 2019. Additionally, the Board of Directors also approved a resolution which limits the Company's issuance of senior securities such that the asset coverage ratio, taking into account any such issuance, would not be less than 166%, at any time after the effective date. As of March 31, 2019, the Company's asset coverage was 249%.\nCredit Facility\nIn August 2016, CSWC entered into a senior secured credit facility (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Facility\u201d) to provide additional liquidity to support its investment and operational activities, which included total commitments of $100 million. The Credit Facility contained an accordion feature that allowed CSWC to increase the total commitments under the Credit Facility up to $150 million from new and existing lenders on the same terms and\nconditions as the existing commitments. In August 2017, we increased our total commitments by $15 million through adding an additional lender using the accordion feature.\nOn November 16, 2017, CSWC entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Amendment\u201d) to its Credit Facility. Prior to the Amendment, borrowings under the Credit Facility accrued interest on a per annum basis at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate plus 3.25% with no LIBOR floor. CSWC paid unused commitment fees of 0.50% to 1.50% per annum, based on utilization, on the unused lender commitments under the Credit Facility. The Amendment (1) increased the total borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility to $180 million, with commitments from a diversified group of eight lenders, (2) increased the Credit Facility's accordion feature that allows for an increase in total commitments of up to $250 million under the Credit Facility from new and existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments, (3) reduced the interest rate on borrowings from LIBOR plus 3.25% down to LIBOR plus 3.00%, with a further step-down to LIBOR plus 2.75% at the time the Company's net worth exceeds $325 million, (4) reduced unused commitment fees from a utilization-based grid of 0.50% to 1.5% down to a range of 0.50% to 1.0% per annum, and (5) extended the Credit Facility's revolving period that ended on August 30, 2019 through November 16, 2020. Additionally, the final maturity of the Credit Facility was extended from August 30, 2020 to November 16, 2021. On April 16, 2018 and May 11, 2018, CSWC entered into Incremental Assumption Agreements, which increased the total commitments under the Credit Facility by $20 million and $10 million, respectively. The increases were executed in accordance with the accordion feature of the Credit Facility, increasing total commitments from $180 million to $210 million.\nOn December 21, 2018, CSWC entered into the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\"), and a related Amended and Restated Guarantee, Pledge and Security Agreement, to amend and restate its Credit Facility. The Credit Agreement (1) increased the total commitments by $60 million from $210 million to an aggregate total of $270 million, provided by a diversified group of nine lenders, (2) increased the Credit Facility's accordion feature to $350 million under the Credit Facility from new and existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments, (3) reduced the interest rate on borrowings from LIBOR plus 3.00% to LIBOR plus 2.50%, subject to certain conditions as outlined in the Credit Agreement, (4) reduced the minimum asset coverage with respect to senior securities representing indebtedness from 200% to 150% after the date on which such minimum asset coverage is permitted to be reduced by the Company under applicable law, subject to certain conditions as outlined in the Credit Agreement, and (5) extended the Credit Facility's revolving period from November 16, 2020 to December 21, 2022 and the final maturity from November 16, 2021 to December 21, 2023.\nThe Credit Agreement modified certain covenants in the Credit Facility, including: (1) to provide for a minimum senior coverage ratio of 2-to-1 (in addition to the asset coverage ratio noted below), (2) to increase the minimum obligors' net worth test from $160 million to $180 million, (3) to reduce the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio from 2.50-to-1 to 2.25-to-1 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and (4) to provide for the fact that the Company will not declare or pay a dividend or distribution in cash or other property unless immediately prior to and after giving effect thereto the Company's asset coverage ratio exceeds 150% (and certain other conditions are satisfied). The Credit Facility also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to: (1) certain reporting requirements, (2) maintaining RIC and BDC status, (3) maintaining a minimum shareholders' equity, (4) maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth, and (5) at any time the outstanding advances exceed 90% of the borrowing base, maintaining a minimum liquidity of not less than 10% of the covered debt amount.\nThe Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, nonpayment, misrepresentation of representations and warranties in a material respect, breach of covenant, bankruptcy, and change of control, with customary cure and notice provisions. If the Company defaults on its obligations under the Credit Facility, the lenders may have the right to foreclose upon and sell, or otherwise transfer, the collateral subject to their security interests. There are no changes to the covenants or the events of default in the Credit Facility as a result of the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Facility is secured by (1) substantially all of the present and future property and assets of the Company and the guarantors and (2) 100% of the equity interests in the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2019, substantially all of the Company's assets were pledged as collateral for the Credit Facility.\nAt March 31, 2019, CSWC had $141.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. CSWC recognized interest expense related to the Credit Facility, including unused commitment fees and amortization of deferred loan costs of $7.3 million and $3.7 million, respectively, for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. The weighted average interest rate on the Credit Facility was 5.41% and 4.66%, respectively, for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. Average borrowings for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were $99.8 million and $42.2 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, CSWC was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Facility.\nDecember 2022 Notes\nIn December 2017, the Company issued $57.5 million in aggregate principal amount, including the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional principal amounts to cover over-allotments, of 5.95% Notes due 2022 (the December 2022 Notes\u201d). The December 2022 Notes mature on December 15, 2022 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time, or from time to time, at the Company's option on or after December 15, 2019. The December 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.95% per year, payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2018. The December 2022 Notes are an unsecured obligation, rank pari passu with our other outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, including borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nOn June 11, 2018, the Company entered into an \"At-The-Market\" (\"ATM\") debt distribution agreement, pursuant to which it may offer for sale, from time to time, up to $50 million in aggregate principal amount of December 2022 Notes through B. Riley FBR, Inc., acting as its sales agent (the 2022 Notes Agent\u201d). Sales of the December 2022 Notes may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be \"at the market offerings\" as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, or similar securities exchanges or sales made through a market maker other than on an exchange at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.\nThe 2022 Notes Agent receives a commission from the Company equal to up to 2% of the gross sales of any December 2022 Notes sold through the 2022 Notes Agent under the debt distribution agreement. The 2022 Notes Agent is not required to sell any specific principal amount of December 2022 Notes, but will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its sales and trading practices to sell the December 2022 Notes. The December 2022 Notes trade flat,\u201d which means that purchasers in the secondary market will not pay, and sellers will not receive, any accrued and unpaid interest on the December 2022 Notes that is not reflected in the trading price.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company sold 785,447 December 2022 Notes for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $19.6 million at a weighted average effective yield of 5.86%. At this time, the Company does not intend to issue additional December 2022 Notes under this ATM debt distribution agreement.\nAll issuances of December 2022 Notes rank equally in right of payment and form a single series of notes.\nAs of March 31, 2019, the carrying amount of the December 2022 Notes was $75.1 million. As of March 31, 2019, the fair value of the December 2022 Notes was $78.7 million. The fair value is based on the closing price of the security of The Nasdaq Global Select Market, which is a Level 1 input under ASC 820. The Company recognized interest expense related to the December 2022 Notes, including amortization of deferred issuance costs, of $4.8 million and $1.2 million for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Average borrowings for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were $70.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively.\nThe indenture governing the December 2022 Notes contains certain covenants including but not limited to (i) a requirement that the Company comply with the asset coverage requirement of Section 18(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions thereto, after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to the Company by the SEC, (ii) a requirement, subject to a limited exception, that the Company will not declare any cash dividend, or declare any other cash distribution, upon a class of its capital stock, or purchase any such capital stock, unless, in every such case, at the time of the declaration of any such dividend or distribution, or at the time of any such purchase, the Company has the minimum asset coverage required pursuant to Section 18(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act or any successor provision thereto after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase price, as the case may be, giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to the Company by the SEC and (iii) a requirement to provide financial information to the holders of the December 2022 Notes and the trustee under the indenture if the Company should no longer be subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. The indenture and supplement relating to the December 2022 Notes also provides for customary events of default. As of March 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the December 2022 Notes.\nEquity Capital Activities\nIn January 2016, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $10 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with guidelines specified in Rules 10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(B) and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. During the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company repurchased a total of 10,452 shares at an average price of $17.72 per share, including commissions paid. As of March 31, 2019, we had repurchased a total of 46,363 shares of our common stock in the open market\nunder the stock repurchase program, at an average price of $16.67, including commissions paid, leaving approximately $9.2 million available for additional repurchases under the program.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company completed an offering of 700,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a net price of $18.90 per share, which was above NAV per share at the time of the offering. The Company issued 100,000 shares of its common stock to certain institutional investors in a direct registered offering and 600,000 shares of its common stock in a \"best efforts\" underwritten offering. The total net proceeds of the offerings, before expenses, was approximately $13.2 million.\nOn March 4, 2019, the Company entered into separate equity distribution agreements with certain sales agents pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50,000,000 (the \"Equity ATM Program\"). During the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company sold 263,656 shares of its common stock under the Equity ATM Program at a weighted-average price of $21.47 per share, raising $5.7 million of gross proceeds. Net proceeds were $5.5 million after commissions to the sales agents on shares sold.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities through existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated through our ongoing operating activities, utilization of available borrowings under our Credit Facility and future issuances of debt and equity on terms we believe are favorable to the Company and our shareholders. Our primary uses of funds will be investments in portfolio companies and operating expenses.\nIn order to satisfy the Code requirements applicable to a RIC, we intend to distribute to our shareholders, after consideration and application of our ability under the Code to carry forward certain excess undistributed taxable income from one tax year into the next tax year, substantially all of our taxable income.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and fund equity capital and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet.\nAt March 31, 2019 and 2018, we had a total of approximately $17.7 million and $11.6 million, respectively, in currently unfunded commitments (as discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As of March 31, 2019, the total unfunded commitments included commitments to issue letters of credit through a financial intermediary on behalf of certain portfolio companies. As of March 31, 2019, we had $3.4 million in letters of credit issued and outstanding under these commitments on behalf of the portfolio companies. For the letters of credit issued and outstanding, we would be required to make payments to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment obligations. Of these letters of credit, $3.4 million expire in May 2020. As of March 31, 2019, none of the letters of credit issued and outstanding were recorded as a liability on the Company's balance sheet as such letters of credit are considered in the valuation of the investments in the portfolio company.\nThe Company believes its assets will provide adequate coverage to satisfy these commitments. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $9.9 million and $125.6 million in available borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nContractual Obligations\nAs shown below, we had the following contractual obligations as of March 31, 2019. For information on our unfunded investment commitments, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Facility (1)\n</td> <td>177,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 2022 Notes (2)\n</td> <td>94,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>272,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>234,762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Amounts include interest payments calculated at an average rate of 5.41% of outstanding Credit Facility borrowings, which were $141.0 million as of March 31, 2019. \n (2) Includes interest payments. \nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nOn May 23, 2019, CSWC entered into an Incremental Assumption Agreement, which increased the total commitments under the Credit Facility, by $25 million. The increase was executed under the accordion feature of the Credit Facility and increased total commitments from $270 million to $295 million.\nOn May 30, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors declared a total dividend of $0.49 per share, comprised of a regular dividend of $0.39 and a supplemental dividend of $0.10, for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. The record date for the dividend is June 14, 2019. The payment date for the dividend is June 28, 2019.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Statements we make in the following discussion which express a belief, expectation or intention, as well as those that are not historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results, could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors, including the risks and uncertainties we have referred to under the headings Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an internally managed closed-end, non-diversified investment company that has been elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We specialize in providing customized debt and equity financing to LMM companies and debt capital to UMM companies in a broad range of investment segments located primarily in the United States. Our investment objective is to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity and equity related investments. Our investment strategy is to partner with business owners, management teams and financial sponsors to provide flexible financing solutions to fund growth, changes of control, or other corporate events. We invest primarily in senior debt securities, secured by security interests in portfolio company assets, and in secured and unsecured subordinated debt securities. We also invest in equity interests in our portfolio companies alongside our debt securities.\nWe focus on investing in companies with histories of generating revenues and positive cash flow, established market positions and proven management teams with strong operating discipline. We target senior debt, subordinated debt, and equity investments in LMM companies, as well as first and second lien syndicated loans in UMM companies. Our target LMM companies\ntypically have annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) between $3.0 million and $15.0 million, and our LMM investments generally range in size from $5.0 million to $25.0 million. Our UMM investments generally include syndicated first and second lien loans in companies with EBITDA generally greater than $50.0 million, and our UMM investments typically range in size from $5.0 million to $15.0 million.\nWe seek to fill the financing gap for LMM companies, which, historically, have had more limited access to financing from commercial banks and other traditional sources. The underserved nature of the LMM creates the opportunity for us to meet the financing needs of LMM companies while also negotiating favorable transaction terms and equity participations. Our ability to invest across a LMM company's capital structure, from secured loans to equity securities, allows us to offer portfolio companies a comprehensive suite of financing options. Providing customized financing solutions is important to LMM companies. We generally seek to partner directly with financial sponsors, entrepreneurs, management teams and business owners in making our investments. Our LMM debt investments typically include senior loans with a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company, as well as subordinated debt which may either be secured or unsecured subordinated loans. Our LMM debt investments typically have a term of between five and seven years from the original investment date. We also often seek to invest in the equity securities of our LMM portfolio companies.\nOur investments in UMM companies primarily consist of direct investments in or secondary purchases of interest bearing debt securities in privately held companies that are generally larger in size than the LMM companies included in our portfolio. Our UMM debt investments are generally secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have an expected duration of between three and seven years from the original investment date.\nSince the Share Distribution on September 30, 2015 through March 31, 2019, our exited investments resulted in a weighted average internal rate of return to the Company of approximately 18.2% (based on original cash invested of approximately $165.0 million). Internal rate of return is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows related to a particular investment equal to zero. Internal rate of return is gross of expenses related to investments as these expenses are not allocable to specific investments. Investments are considered to be exited when the original investment objective has been achieved through the receipt of cash and/or non-cash consideration upon the repayment of a debt investment or sale of an investment or through the determination that no further consideration was collectible and, thus, a loss may have been realized. Approximately 90.3% of these exited investments resulted in an aggregate cash flow realized internal rate of return to the Company of 10% or greater.\nBecause we are internally managed, we do not pay any external investment advisory fees, but instead directly incur the operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals. We believe that our internally managed structure provides us with a beneficial operating expense structure when compared to other publicly traded and privately held investment firms which are externally managed, and our internally managed structure allows us the opportunity to leverage our non-interest operating expenses as we grow our investment portfolio. For the years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the ratio of our annualized fourth quarter operating expenses, excluding interest expense, as a percentage of our quarterly average total assets was 2.81%, 3.36% and 4.54%, respectively.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements. We have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the matters below. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of our critical accounting policies follows.\nValuation of Investments\nThe most significant determination inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of our investment portfolio and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, our investment portfolio at fair value represented approximately 95.0% and 94.2% of our total assets, respectively. We are required to report our investments at fair value. We follow the provisions of ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value, and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASC 820 requires us to assume that the portfolio investment is to be sold in the principal market to independent market participants, which may be a hypothetical market. See Note 4 - Fair Value\nMeasurements\u201d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our investment portfolio valuation process and procedures.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process, our determination of fair value for our investment portfolio may differ materially from the values that would have been determined had a ready market for the securities actually existed. In addition, changes in the market environment, portfolio company performance, and other events may occur over the lives of the investments that may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned. We determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation.\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value for our investment portfolio and our valuation procedures, consistent with 1940 Act requirements. Our Board of Directors believes that our investment portfolio as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 reflects fair value as of those dates based on the markets in which we operate and other conditions in existence on those reporting dates.\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest and Dividend Income\nInterest and dividend income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recognized on the date dividends are declared by the portfolio company or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution. Discounts/premiums received to par on loans purchased are capitalized and accreted or amortized into income over the life of the loan. In accordance with our valuation policy, accrued interest and dividend income is evaluated periodically for collectability. When we do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations, we will generally establish a reserve against interest income receivable, thereby placing the loan or debt security on non-accrual status, and cease to recognize interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due. If a loan or debt security's status significantly improves regarding ability to service debt or other obligations, it will be restored to accrual basis. As of March 31, 2019 we had one investment on non-accrual status, which comprised of approximately 1.6% of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately 1.9% of its cost. As of March 31, 2018, we did not have any investments on non-accrual status.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize on the balance sheet a right-of-use asset, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months. The guidance also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures designed to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The standard requires the use of a modified retrospective transition approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. Based on our assessment of the new standard, the single change relates to the recognition of a new right-of-use asset and lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet for our office space operating lease. We currently have one operating lease for office space and do not expect a significant change in our leasing activity between now and adoption. As such, the adoption will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. See further discussion of our operating lease obligation in \"Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements under SAC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the ASC. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new guidance, an entity is required to perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The new guidance will significantly enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. Additionally, the guidance requires improved disclosures as to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)-Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. This ASU clarified guidance on assessing collectability, presenting sales tax, measuring noncash consideration, and certain transition matters. The new guidance is effective for the annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim\nperiods within that reporting period. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 effective April 1, 2018 and determined that its material financial contracts are excluded from the scope of ASU 2014-09. As a result of the scope exception for financial contracts, the Company's management has determined that there were no material changes to the recognition timing and classification of revenues and expenses; additionally, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a significant impact on pretax income or on the consolidated financial statement disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), which is intended to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein. The Company adopted ASU 2016-15 effective April 1, 2018 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which changes the fair value measurement disclosure requirements of ASC 820. The key provisions include new, eliminated and modified disclosure requirements. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods therein. Early application is permitted. CSWC is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements, but the impact of the adoption is not expected to be material.\nIn August 2018, the SEC issued the Final Rule Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification, amending certain disclosure requirements that were redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated or superseded. The amendments are intended to facilitate the disclosure of information to investors and simplify compliance. The final rule was effective on November 5, 2018. The Company adopted these disclosure updates in the quarter ended December 31, 2018. The disclosure updates impacted the presentation of the consolidated financial statements by requiring the presentation of the total, rather than the components of the distributable earnings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, the Company updated the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Net Assets for the new interim reporting requirement to disclose the current and comparative year-to-date periods, including subtotals for each interim periods. Management does not consider the impact of these disclosure updates to be material to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2019, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No. 33-10618, FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, which amends certain SEC disclosure requirements. The amendments are intended to simplify certain disclosure requirements, improve readability and navigability of disclosure documents, and discourage repetition and disclosure of immaterial information. The amendments are effective for all filings submitted on or after May 2, 2019. The Company adopted the requisite amendments effective May 2, 2019. As it pertains to the Company for this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there were no significant changes to the Company's consolidated financial position or disclosures. The Company is still evaluating the impact this amendment will have on its other future periodic filings and registration statements.\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION\nOur LMM investments consist of secured debt, subordinated debt, equity warrants and direct equity investments in privately held, LMM companies based in the United States. Our LMM portfolio companies generally have annual EBITDA between $3.0 million and $15.0 million, and our LMM investments typically range in size from $5.0 million to $25.0 million. The LMM debt investments are typically secured by either a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company, generally bear interest at floating rates, and generally have a term of between five and seven years from the original investment date.\nOur UMM investments consist of direct investments in or secondary purchases of interest-bearing debt securities in privately held companies based in the United States that are generally larger in size than the LMM companies included in our portfolio with EBITDA generally greater than $50.0 million. Our UMM investments typically range in size from $5.0 million to $15.0 million. Our UMM debt investments are generally secured by ether a first or second priority lien on the assets of the portfolio company and typically have a term of between three and seven years from the original investment date.\nThe total value of our investment portfolio was $524.1 million as of March 31, 2019, as compared to $393.1 million as of March 31, 2018. As of March 31, 2019, we had investments in 37 portfolio companies with an aggregate cost of $478.1 million. As of March 31, 2018, we had investments in 30 portfolio companies with an aggregate cost of $335.4 million.\nAs of March 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately $348.2 million, or 94.7%, and $220.3 million, or 92.1%, respectively, of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) bore interest at floating rates, of which 87.8% and 94.2%, respectively, were subject to contractual minimum interest rates. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately $19.5 million, or 5.3%, and $18.8 million, or 7.9%, respectively, of our debt investment portfolio (at fair value) bore interest at fixed rates.\nThe following tables provide a summary of our investments in LMM and UMM companies as of March 31, 2019 and 2018 (excluding our investment in I-45 SLF LLC):\n\n (a) At March 31, 2019, we had equity ownership in approximately 73.1% of our LMM investments. \n (b) The weighted-average annual effective yields were computed using the effective interest rates for all debt investments at cost as of March 31, 2019, including accretion of original issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt instruments and any debt investments on non-accrual status. As of March 31, 2019, there was one investment on non-accrual status. Weighted-average annual effective yield is higher than what an investor in shares in our common stock will realize on its investment because it does not reflect our expenses or any sales load paid by an investor. \n (c) Weighted average metrics are calculated using investment cost basis weighting. \n (d) Includes CSWC debt investments only. Calculated as the amount of each portfolio company's debt (including CSWC's position and debt senior or pari passu to CSWC's position, but excluding debt subordinated to CSWC's position) in the capital structure divided by each portfolio company's adjusted EBITDA. Management uses this metric as a guide to evaluate the relative risk of its position in each portfolio debt investment. \n\n (a) At March 31, 2018, we had equity ownership in approximately 73.7% of our LMM investments. \n (b) The weighted-average annual effective yields were computed using the effective interest rates for all debt investments at cost as of March 31, 2018, including accretion of original issue discount but excluding fees payable upon repayment of the debt instruments and any debt investments on non-accrual status. As of March 31, 2018, there were no investments on non-accrual status. Weighted-average annual effective yield is higher than what an investor in shares in our common stock will realize on its investment because it does not reflect our expenses or any sales load paid by an investor. \n (c) Weighted average metrics are calculated using investment cost basis weighting. \n (d) Includes CSWC debt investments only. Calculated as the amount of each portfolio company's debt (including CSWC's position and debt senior or pari passu to CSWC's position, but excluding debt subordinated to CSWC's position) in the capital structure divided by each portfolio company's adjusted EBITDA. Management uses this metric as a guide to evaluate the relative risk of its position in each portfolio debt investment. \nAs of March 31, 2019 and 2018, our investment portfolio consisted of the following investments:\n\n 1 Included in first lien loans are loans structured as first lien last out loans. These loans may in certain cases be subordinated in payment priority to other senior secured lenders. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of the first lien last out loans are $38.6 million and $26.9 million, respectively. \n 2 Included in second lien loans are loans structured as split lien term loans. These loans provide the Company with a first lien priority on certain assets of the obligor and a second lien priority on different assets of the obligor. As of March 31, 2019 , the fair value of the split lien term loans are $18.3 million. As of March 31, 2018, there were no investments in split lien term loans. \n 3 I-45 SLF LLC is a joint venture between CSWC and Main Street Capital. This entity primarily invests in syndicated senior secured loans in the UMM. The portfolio companies held by I-45 SLF LLC represent a diverse set of industry classifications, which are similar to those in which CSWC invests directly. We own 80.0% of I-45 SLF LLC and have a profits interest of 75.6%, while Main Street Capital owns 20.0% and has a profits interest of 24.4%. I-45 SLF LLC's Board of Managers makes all investment and operational decisions for the fund, and consists of equal representation from our Company and Main Street Capital. The Company does not guarantee or otherwise obligate itself to make payments on debts owed by I-45 SLF LLC. \nPortfolio Asset Quality\nWe utilize an internally developed investment rating system to rate the performance and monitor the expected level of returns for each debt investment in our portfolio. The investment rating system takes into account both quantitative and qualitative factors of the portfolio company and the investments held therein, including each investment's expected level of returns and the collectability of our debt investments, comparisons to competitors and other industry participants and the portfolio company's future outlook. The ratings are not intended to reflect the performance or expected level of returns of our equity investments.\n \u2022 Investment Rating 1 represents the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The investment is performing materially above underwriting expectations and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable. \n \u2022 Investment Rating 2 indicates the investment is performing as expected at the time of underwriting and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable to neutral. \n \u2022 Investment Rating 3 involves an investment performing below underwriting expectations and the trends and risk factors are generally neutral to negative. The portfolio company or investment may be out of compliance with financial covenants and interest payments may be impaired, however principal payments are generally not past due. \n \u2022 Investment Rating 4 indicates that the investment is performing materially below underwriting expectations, the trends and risk factors are generally negative and the risk of the investment has increased substantially. Interest and principal payments on our investment are likely to be impaired. \nThe following table shows the distribution of our debt portfolio investments on the 1 to 4 investment rating scale at fair value as of March 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nInterest and dividend income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected. When we do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations, we will generally establish a reserve against interest income receivable, thereby placing the loan or debt security on non-accrual status, and cease to recognize interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due.\nAs of March 31, 2019, we had one debt investment on non-accrual status, which comprised of approximately 1.6% of our total investment portfolio's fair value and approximately 1.9% of its cost. As of March 31, 2018, we did not have any investments on non-accrual status.\nInvestment Activity\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, we made new debt investments in 13 portfolio companies totaling $173.7 million, follow-on debt investments in 10 portfolio companies totaling $32.8 million, and equity investments in three existing and seven new portfolio companies totaling $19.9 million. We also funded $3.2 million on our existing equity commitment to I-45 SLF LLC. We received contractual principal repayments totaling approximately $10.3 million and full prepayments of approximately $36.1 million from eight portfolio companies. In addition, we received proceeds from sales of investments totaling $63.3 million and recognized net realized gains on those sales totaling $20.4 million.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2018, we made new debt investments in 14 portfolio companies totaling $142.9 million, follow-on debt investments in four portfolio companies totaling $9.4 million, and equity investments in one existing and seven new portfolio companies totaling $9.8 million. We also funded $4.0 million on our existing equity commitment to I-45 SLF LLC. We received contractual principal repayments totaling approximately $11.7 million and full prepayments of approximately $72.2 million from 13 portfolio companies.\nTotal portfolio investment activity for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was as follows (in thousands):\n\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe composite measure of our financial performance in the Consolidated Statements of Operations is captioned Net increase (decrease) in net assets from operations\u201d and consists of three elements. The first is Net investment income (loss),\u201d which is the difference between income from interest, dividends and fees and our combined operating and interest expenses, net of applicable income taxes. The second element is Net realized gain (loss) on investments before income tax,\u201d which is the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio securities and their stated cost. The third element is the Net change in unrealized appreciation on investments, net of tax\u201d which is the net change in the market or fair value of our investment portfolio, compared with stated cost. It should be noted that the Net realized gain (loss) on investments before income tax\u201d and Net change in unrealized appreciation on investments, net of tax\u201d are directly related in that when an appreciated portfolio security is sold to realize a gain, a corresponding decrease in net unrealized appreciation occurs by transferring the gain associated with the transaction from being unrealized\u201d to being realized.\u201d Conversely, when a loss is realized on a depreciated portfolio security, an increase in net unrealized appreciation occurs.\nComparison of years ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018\n\nInvestment Income\nTotal investment income consisted of interest income, management fees, dividend income and other income for each applicable period. For the year ended March 31, 2019, total investment income was $51.9 million, a $16.8 million, or 47.7%, increase over total investment income of $35.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $15.4 million, or 70.5%, increase in interest income generated from our debt investments due to a 56.2% increase in the cost basis of debt investments held from $236.8 million to $369.8 million year over year. In addition, the weighted average yield on debt investments increased from 11.46% to 11.58%.\nWe received fees and other income of $1.7 million and $0.9 million for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase year over year related primarily to prepayment and amendment fees.\nOperating Expenses\nDue to the nature of our business, the majority of our operating expenses are related to interest and fees on our borrowings, employee compensation (including both cash and share-based compensation), and general and administrative expenses.\nInterest and Fees on our Borrowings\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, total interest expense was $12.2 million, an increase of $7.3 million, as compared to the total interest expense of $4.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $57.6 million in average borrowings on our Credit Facility and an increase of $53.2 million in average borrowings related to the December 2022 Notes outstanding during the year ended March 31, 2019.\nSalaries, General and Administrative Expenses\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, total employee compensation expense (including both cash and share-based compensation) was $10.0 million, a $0.8 million, or 8.1%, increase over total employee compensation expense of $9.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount, as well as additional restricted stock award grants, offset by the Spin-off Compensation Plan, which was fully paid out in 2018. For the year ended March 31, 2019, our total general and administrative expense was $5.0 million, an increase of $0.4 million as compared to the total general and administrative expense of $4.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in board-related expenses due to the addition of a new board member, an increase in insurance costs, and an increase in legal, audit and printing fees relating to maintaining the Company's shelf registration with the SEC.\nNet Investment Income\nFor the year ended March 31, 2019, net investment income increased from the prior year by $7.5 million, or 46.1%, to $23.7 million as a result of a $16.8 million increase in total investment income, offset by a $0.9 million increase in income tax expense and a $7.3 million increase in interest expense.\nIncrease in Net Assets from Operations\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we recognized realized gains on investments before income tax totaling $20.9 million, which consisted of gains on the partial repayments of six non-control/non-affiliate debt investments, full repayments of seven non-control/non-affiliate debt investments and the sale of one control, one affiliate and one non-control/non-affiliate equity investment. Realized gains on investments include a realized gain on the sale of TitanLiner, Inc. of $18.6 million and a realized gain on the sale of Deepwater Corrosion Services of $1.7 million.\nIn addition, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we recorded net unrealized depreciation on investments, net of tax, totaling $11.5 million, consisting of net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio of $2.6 million, the reversal of $14.3 million of net unrealized appreciation recognized in prior periods due to the realized gains noted above, and net unrealized appreciation related to deferred tax associated with the Taxable Subsidiary of $0.2 million. Net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio included unrealized gains on Media Recovery, Inc. of $9.6 million, partially offset by unrealized losses on I-45 SLF LLC of $4.6 million and American Teleconferencing Services, Ltd. of $2.9 million. These unrealized gains and losses were due to changes in fair value based on the overall EBITDA performance and cash flows of each investment as determined by our Board of Directors.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, we recognized realized gains on investments before income tax totaling $1.6 million, which consisted of net gains on the partial repayments of five non-control/non-affiliate investments and full repayments of 13 non-control/non-affiliate investments.\nIn addition, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, we recorded net unrealized appreciation, net of tax, on investments totaling $21.5 million, consisting of net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio of $22.0 million, the reversal of $0.6 million of net unrealized appreciation recognized in prior periods due to the realized gains noted above, and net unrealized depreciation related to deferred tax associated with the Taxable Subsidiary of $0.1 million. Net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio included unrealized gains on TitanLiner, Inc. of $20.3 million and Media Recovery, Inc. of $5.3 million, partially offset by unrealized losses on Deepwater Corrosion Services of $5.3 million. These unrealized gains and losses were due to changes in fair value based on the overall EBITDA performance and cash flows of each investment.\nComparison of years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017\n\nInvestment Income\nTotal investment income consisted of interest income, management fees, dividend income and other income for each applicable period. For the year ended March 31, 2018, total investment income was $35.1 million, an $11.7 million, or 49.6%, increase over total investment income of $23.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $9.4 million, or 76.0%, increase in interest income generated from our debt investments due to a 42.6% increase in the cost basis of debt investments held from $166.1 million to $236.8 million year over year in addition to an increase in the weighted average yield on debt investments from 10.28% to 11.46%.\nWe receive management fees primarily from our controlled affiliate investments which aggregated $0.4 million for both the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. We also received other miscellaneous fees and income of approximately $0.5 million and $0.6 million during the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related primarily to other portfolio company activity.\nOperating Expenses\nDue to the nature of our business, the majority of our operating expenses are related to interest and fees on our borrowings, employee compensation (including both cash and share-based compensation), and general and administrative expenses.\nInterest and Fees on our Borrowings\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, total interest expense was $4.9 million, an increase of $3.9 million as compared to the total interest expense of $1.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $24.4 million in average borrowings on our Credit Facility during the year ended March 31, 2018, as well as an increase of$57.5 million in December 2022 Notes outstanding.\nSalaries, General and Administrative Expenses\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, total employee compensation expense (including both cash and share-based compensation) was $9.2 million, a $1.0 million, or 12.4%, increase over total employee compensation expense of $8.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount, as well as additional restricted stock award grants. For both the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, total general and administrative expense was $4.6 million.\nNet Investment Income/Loss\nFor the year ended March 31, 2018, net investment income was $16.2 million, a $8.3 million, or 105.8%, increase over net investment income of $7.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The increase was driven by an $11.7 million increase in total investment income and a $1.6 million decrease in income tax expense primarily due to the tax reform, offset by a $3.9 million increase in interest expense and a $1.0 million increase in employee compensation expense.\nIncrease/Decrease in Net Assets from Operations\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we recognized realized gains on investments before income tax totaling $7.9 million, which consisted of net gains on the partial repayments of 22 non-control/non-affiliate investments, full repayments on five non-control/non-affiliate investments and the sale of certain equity securities.\nIn addition, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, we recorded net unrealized appreciation, net of tax, on investments totaling $7.7 million, consisting of net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio of $12.5 million, the reversal of $4.5 million of net unrealized appreciation recognized in prior periods due to the realized gains noted above, and net unrealized depreciation related to deferred tax associated with the Taxable Subsidiary of $0.3 million. Net unrealized appreciation on our current portfolio included unrealized gains on Media Recovery, Inc. of $5.6 million, Deepwater Corrosion Services, Inc. of $4.9 million and I-45 SLF LLC of $3.1 million, partially offset by unrealized losses on TitanLiner, Inc. of $3.3 million. These unrealized gains and losses were due to changes in fair value based on the overall EBITDA performance and cash flows of each investment.\nFINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur liquidity and capital resources are generated primarily from cash flows from operations, the net proceeds of public offerings of debt securities and advances from the Credit Facility. Management believes that the Company's cash and cash equivalents, cash available from investments, and commitments under the Credit Facility are adequate to meet its needs for the next twelve months.\nCash Flows\nAt March 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $9.9 million. For the year ended March 31, 2019, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $2.0 million. During that period, our operating activities used $94.7 million in cash, consisting primarily of new portfolio investments of $229.6 million, partially offset by $74.7 million of repayments received from debt investments in portfolio companies and $33.9 million of proceeds from sales of equity investments. In addition, our financing activities increased cash by $96.7 million, consisting primarily of net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $101.0 million, proceeds from the issuance of the December 2022 Notes of $19.5 million and proceeds from the offering of common stock of $18.9 million, partially offset by cash dividends paid in the amount of $42.5 million.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $7.9 million. For the year ended March 31, 2018, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $14.5 million. During that period, our operating activities used $63.9 million in cash, consisting primarily of new portfolio investments of $166.2 million, partially offset by $82.5 million of repayments received from debt investments in portfolio companies. In addition, our financing activities increased cash by $49.4 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the issuance of the December 2022 Notes of $55.8 million and net borrowings under the Credit Facility of $15.0 million, partially offset by cash dividends paid in the amount of $18.6 million.\nFinancing Transactions\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limitations, the Company is only allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage (i.e., the ratio of assets less liabilities not represented by senior securities to senior securities such as borrowings), calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, is at least 200% (or, pursuant to the 1940 Act, 150% if certain requirements are met as described in the Business Section under Regulation as a Business Development Company-Senior Securities\u201d) after such borrowing. On April 25, 2018, the Board of Directors unanimously approved the application of the recently modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, the minimum asset coverage ratio applicable to the Company was decreased from 200% to 150%, which became effective April 25, 2019. Additionally, the Board of Directors also approved a resolution which limits the Company's issuance of senior securities such that the asset coverage ratio, taking into account any such issuance, would not be less than 166%, at any time after the effective date. As of March 31, 2019, the Company's asset coverage was 249%.\nCredit Facility\nIn August 2016, CSWC entered into a senior secured credit facility (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the Credit Facility\u201d) to provide additional liquidity to support its investment and operational activities, which included total commitments of $100 million. The Credit Facility contained an accordion feature that allowed CSWC to increase the total commitments under the Credit Facility up to $150 million from new and existing lenders on the same terms and\nconditions as the existing commitments. In August 2017, we increased our total commitments by $15 million through adding an additional lender using the accordion feature.\nOn November 16, 2017, CSWC entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Amendment\u201d) to its Credit Facility. Prior to the Amendment, borrowings under the Credit Facility accrued interest on a per annum basis at a rate equal to the applicable LIBOR rate plus 3.25% with no LIBOR floor. CSWC paid unused commitment fees of 0.50% to 1.50% per annum, based on utilization, on the unused lender commitments under the Credit Facility. The Amendment (1) increased the total borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility to $180 million, with commitments from a diversified group of eight lenders, (2) increased the Credit Facility's accordion feature that allows for an increase in total commitments of up to $250 million under the Credit Facility from new and existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments, (3) reduced the interest rate on borrowings from LIBOR plus 3.25% down to LIBOR plus 3.00%, with a further step-down to LIBOR plus 2.75% at the time the Company's net worth exceeds $325 million, (4) reduced unused commitment fees from a utilization-based grid of 0.50% to 1.5% down to a range of 0.50% to 1.0% per annum, and (5) extended the Credit Facility's revolving period that ended on August 30, 2019 through November 16, 2020. Additionally, the final maturity of the Credit Facility was extended from August 30, 2020 to November 16, 2021. On April 16, 2018 and May 11, 2018, CSWC entered into Incremental Assumption Agreements, which increased the total commitments under the Credit Facility by $20 million and $10 million, respectively. The increases were executed in accordance with the accordion feature of the Credit Facility, increasing total commitments from $180 million to $210 million.\nOn December 21, 2018, CSWC entered into the Amended and Restated Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\"), and a related Amended and Restated Guarantee, Pledge and Security Agreement, to amend and restate its Credit Facility. The Credit Agreement (1) increased the total commitments by $60 million from $210 million to an aggregate total of $270 million, provided by a diversified group of nine lenders, (2) increased the Credit Facility's accordion feature to $350 million under the Credit Facility from new and existing lenders on the same terms and conditions as the existing commitments, (3) reduced the interest rate on borrowings from LIBOR plus 3.00% to LIBOR plus 2.50%, subject to certain conditions as outlined in the Credit Agreement, (4) reduced the minimum asset coverage with respect to senior securities representing indebtedness from 200% to 150% after the date on which such minimum asset coverage is permitted to be reduced by the Company under applicable law, subject to certain conditions as outlined in the Credit Agreement, and (5) extended the Credit Facility's revolving period from November 16, 2020 to December 21, 2022 and the final maturity from November 16, 2021 to December 21, 2023.\nThe Credit Agreement modified certain covenants in the Credit Facility, including: (1) to provide for a minimum senior coverage ratio of 2-to-1 (in addition to the asset coverage ratio noted below), (2) to increase the minimum obligors' net worth test from $160 million to $180 million, (3) to reduce the minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio from 2.50-to-1 to 2.25-to-1 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, and (4) to provide for the fact that the Company will not declare or pay a dividend or distribution in cash or other property unless immediately prior to and after giving effect thereto the Company's asset coverage ratio exceeds 150% (and certain other conditions are satisfied). The Credit Facility also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to: (1) certain reporting requirements, (2) maintaining RIC and BDC status, (3) maintaining a minimum shareholders' equity, (4) maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth, and (5) at any time the outstanding advances exceed 90% of the borrowing base, maintaining a minimum liquidity of not less than 10% of the covered debt amount.\nThe Credit Facility also contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, nonpayment, misrepresentation of representations and warranties in a material respect, breach of covenant, bankruptcy, and change of control, with customary cure and notice provisions. If the Company defaults on its obligations under the Credit Facility, the lenders may have the right to foreclose upon and sell, or otherwise transfer, the collateral subject to their security interests. There are no changes to the covenants or the events of default in the Credit Facility as a result of the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Facility is secured by (1) substantially all of the present and future property and assets of the Company and the guarantors and (2) 100% of the equity interests in the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2019, substantially all of the Company's assets were pledged as collateral for the Credit Facility.\nAt March 31, 2019, CSWC had $141.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. CSWC recognized interest expense related to the Credit Facility, including unused commitment fees and amortization of deferred loan costs of $7.3 million and $3.7 million, respectively, for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. The weighted average interest rate on the Credit Facility was 5.41% and 4.66%, respectively, for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018. Average borrowings for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were $99.8 million and $42.2 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2019 and 2018, CSWC was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Facility.\nDecember 2022 Notes\nIn December 2017, the Company issued $57.5 million in aggregate principal amount, including the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional principal amounts to cover over-allotments, of 5.95% Notes due 2022 (the December 2022 Notes\u201d). The December 2022 Notes mature on December 15, 2022 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time, or from time to time, at the Company's option on or after December 15, 2019. The December 2022 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.95% per year, payable quarterly on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2018. The December 2022 Notes are an unsecured obligation, rank pari passu with our other outstanding and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, including borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nOn June 11, 2018, the Company entered into an \"At-The-Market\" (\"ATM\") debt distribution agreement, pursuant to which it may offer for sale, from time to time, up to $50 million in aggregate principal amount of December 2022 Notes through B. Riley FBR, Inc., acting as its sales agent (the 2022 Notes Agent\u201d). Sales of the December 2022 Notes may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be \"at the market offerings\" as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, or similar securities exchanges or sales made through a market maker other than on an exchange at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.\nThe 2022 Notes Agent receives a commission from the Company equal to up to 2% of the gross sales of any December 2022 Notes sold through the 2022 Notes Agent under the debt distribution agreement. The 2022 Notes Agent is not required to sell any specific principal amount of December 2022 Notes, but will use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its sales and trading practices to sell the December 2022 Notes. The December 2022 Notes trade flat,\u201d which means that purchasers in the secondary market will not pay, and sellers will not receive, any accrued and unpaid interest on the December 2022 Notes that is not reflected in the trading price.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company sold 785,447 December 2022 Notes for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $19.6 million at a weighted average effective yield of 5.86%. At this time, the Company does not intend to issue additional December 2022 Notes under this ATM debt distribution agreement.\nAll issuances of December 2022 Notes rank equally in right of payment and form a single series of notes.\nAs of March 31, 2019, the carrying amount of the December 2022 Notes was $75.1 million. As of March 31, 2019, the fair value of the December 2022 Notes was $78.7 million. The fair value is based on the closing price of the security of The Nasdaq Global Select Market, which is a Level 1 input under ASC 820. The Company recognized interest expense related to the December 2022 Notes, including amortization of deferred issuance costs, of $4.8 million and $1.2 million for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Average borrowings for the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were $70.1 million and $16.9 million, respectively.\nThe indenture governing the December 2022 Notes contains certain covenants including but not limited to (i) a requirement that the Company comply with the asset coverage requirement of Section 18(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions thereto, after giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to the Company by the SEC, (ii) a requirement, subject to a limited exception, that the Company will not declare any cash dividend, or declare any other cash distribution, upon a class of its capital stock, or purchase any such capital stock, unless, in every such case, at the time of the declaration of any such dividend or distribution, or at the time of any such purchase, the Company has the minimum asset coverage required pursuant to Section 18(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act or any successor provision thereto after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase price, as the case may be, giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to the Company by the SEC and (iii) a requirement to provide financial information to the holders of the December 2022 Notes and the trustee under the indenture if the Company should no longer be subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. The indenture and supplement relating to the December 2022 Notes also provides for customary events of default. As of March 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the December 2022 Notes.\nEquity Capital Activities\nIn January 2016, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $10 million in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock in the open market at certain thresholds below our net asset value per share, in accordance with guidelines specified in Rules 10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(B) and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. During the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company repurchased a total of 10,452 shares at an average price of $17.72 per share, including commissions paid. As of March 31, 2019, we had repurchased a total of 46,363 shares of our common stock in the open market\nunder the stock repurchase program, at an average price of $16.67, including commissions paid, leaving approximately $9.2 million available for additional repurchases under the program.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company completed an offering of 700,000 shares of the Company's common stock at a net price of $18.90 per share, which was above NAV per share at the time of the offering. The Company issued 100,000 shares of its common stock to certain institutional investors in a direct registered offering and 600,000 shares of its common stock in a \"best efforts\" underwritten offering. The total net proceeds of the offerings, before expenses, was approximately $13.2 million.\nOn March 4, 2019, the Company entered into separate equity distribution agreements with certain sales agents pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50,000,000 (the \"Equity ATM Program\"). During the year ended March 31, 2019, the Company sold 263,656 shares of its common stock under the Equity ATM Program at a weighted-average price of $21.47 per share, raising $5.7 million of gross proceeds. Net proceeds were $5.5 million after commissions to the sales agents on shares sold.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities through existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated through our ongoing operating activities, utilization of available borrowings under our Credit Facility and future issuances of debt and equity on terms we believe are favorable to the Company and our shareholders. Our primary uses of funds will be investments in portfolio companies and operating expenses.\nIn order to satisfy the Code requirements applicable to a RIC, we intend to distribute to our shareholders, after consideration and application of our ability under the Code to carry forward certain excess undistributed taxable income from one tax year into the next tax year, substantially all of our taxable income.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and fund equity capital and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet.\nAt March 31, 2019 and 2018, we had a total of approximately $17.7 million and $11.6 million, respectively, in currently unfunded commitments (as discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As of March 31, 2019, the total unfunded commitments included commitments to issue letters of credit through a financial intermediary on behalf of certain portfolio companies. As of March 31, 2019, we had $3.4 million in letters of credit issued and outstanding under these commitments on behalf of the portfolio companies. For the letters of credit issued and outstanding, we would be required to make payments to third parties if the portfolio companies were to default on their related payment obligations. Of these letters of credit, $3.4 million expire in May 2020.

engaged primarily in providing debt and equity financing to lower middle market (LMM) and upper middle market (UMM) companies, primarily in the United States.\n\nKey Highlights Include:\n\n1. Overview: The company, a closed-end, non-diversified investment company and a Business Development Company (BDC) regulated under the 1940 Act, specializes in debt and equity financing for LMMs and debt capital for UMMs. It strives for risk-adjusted returns via current income from debt investments and capital appreciation from equity/equity-related investments.\n\n2. Investment Strategy and Objective: It focuses on companies with a history of revenue generation, cash flow positives, stable market positions, and proven management. Targeted LMM companies usually have EBITDA between $3.0 million and $15.0 million, with investment sizes ranging from $5.0 million to $25.0 million. Investments in UMMs range from $5.0 million to $15.0 million for companies with an EBITDA over $50.0 million.\n\n3. Financial Highlights: The company exited investments yielding an approximate internal rate of return of 18.2%, with 90.3% of the exited investments generating an internal rate of return of 10% or more. The company operates as an internally managed BDC, resulting in operating expense ratios of 2.81%, 3.36%, and 4.54% for the years ending in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\n\n4. Accounting Policies and Estimates: Valuation of the Investment Portfolio and Revenue Recognition are identified as critical accounting policies. Investment valuations are subject to market environment changes and company performances that affect the fair value and may materially differ from the stated values.\n\n5. Portfolio Composition: The company's investments include secured debt, subordinated debt, equity warrants, and direct equity investments, largely in private U.S. companies. As of March 31, 2019, the total investment portfolio was valued at $524.1 million, up from $393.1 million the previous year.\n\n6. Investment Portfolio Quality: The company rates each debt investment in its portfolio using an internal system. As of March 31, 2019, 94.1% of the debt investment portfolio had a rating of 1 or 2, indicating low risk or performance as expected.\n\n7. Investment Activity: New debt and equity investments and funding commitments totaled approximately $229.6 million. The company received contractual principal repayments and proceeds from sales of investments totaling approximately $97.7 million.\n\n8. Liquidity and Capital Resources: The company believes it has adequate liquidity to meet its needs for the next twelve months, with a coverage ratio of 249% as of March 31, 2019, indicating compliance with the 1940 Act's requirements.\n\n9. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations: The company has unfunded commitments and leased obligations. As of the year end, the total for the various obligations and commitments was $272.7 million.\n\n10. Recent Developments: Post-reporting period, the company increased its Credit Facility commitments by $25 million under the accordion feature, taking the total commitments to $295 million.\n\nThe report ultimately concludes on a positive note regarding the company's performance during the year, with high returns on exited investments and solid internal management contributing to a favorable expense structure. However, the forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties."}
