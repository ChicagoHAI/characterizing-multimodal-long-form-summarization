We intend for these forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor provisions created by Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All dollar amounts are stated in thousands, except share data.\nOverview\nWe are a Maryland corporation formed on September 13, 2016 to originate, acquire and manage an investment portfolio of CRE investments primarily comprised of (i) CRE debt, including floating-rate first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage and mezzanine loans, and participations in such loans and (ii) floating-rate CRE securities such as CMBS and senior unsecured debt of publicly traded REITs. We may also invest in select equity investments in single-tenant, net leased properties. Substantially all of our business is conducted through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We are externally managed by our Advisor, an indirect subsidiary of Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation. Our Advisor has engaged the Sub-Advisor, a subsidiary of Sound Point, to perform certain services on behalf of the Advisor for us.\nWe have operated in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2017. Among other requirements, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\nOn October 25, 2016, we commenced the Private Offering of up to $500,000 in Class P Shares. Inland Securities Corporation, an affiliate of our Advisor, was our dealer manager for the Private Offering. On June 28, 2019, we terminated the Private Offering in anticipation of selling shares in the IPO (described below). We continued to accept Private Offering subscription proceeds through\nJuly 16, 2019 from subscription agreements executed no later than June 28, 2019. As of July 16, 2019, we had received and accepted investors' subscriptions for and issued 10,258,094 Class P Shares in the Private Offering, resulting in gross proceeds of $276,681.\nOn May 3, 2019, the SEC declared effective the Registration Statement and we commenced our IPO of up to $2,350,000 in shares of our Class A, Class T, Class S, Class D and Class I common stock pursuant to the Registration Statement. Prior to the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price for each class of our common stock in our primary offering was $25.00 per share, plus applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees, and the per share purchase price for shares of our common stock in our distribution reinvestment plan was $25.00. Following the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price per share for each class of common stock varies and generally equals our prior month's NAV per share, as determined monthly, plus applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. The Dealer Manager serves as our exclusive dealer manager for the IPO on a best efforts basis. As of March 10, 2020, we had received and accepted investors' subscriptions for and issued 652,618 Class A Shares, 396,828 Class T Shares, 49,918 Class D Shares and 376,484 Class I Shares in the IPO, resulting in gross proceeds of $38,272. As of March 10, 2020, $2,311,728 of our shares of common stock remained to be sold in the IPO.\nWe used the net proceeds from the Private Offering and IPO to acquire investments in our target assets in accordance with the objectives and strategies described in Item 1, Business\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFactors Impacting Our Operating Results\nOur operating results can be affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on the timing and amount of capital raised, the composition of our investment portfolio, the amount of leverage applied to our investment portfolio and our net interest income. Several macroeconomic factors impact the interest rate environment and our target assets, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\nMarket Conditions\nWe believe the CRE debt sector represents a large market opportunity. According to Trepp - Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Data, the CRE mortgage market is $3.1 trillion and $2.1 trillion in U.S. CRE mortgages are expected to mature during the period 2020 through 2024. We believe the large volume of maturing CRE loans over the next five years and the resulting need for borrowers to refinance assets will provide a significant opportunity to originate CRE debt. In addition, this volume of refinancings does not include the need to finance the purchases of CRE properties, which will provide additional finance opportunities.\nWe believe the current market conditions create a favorable investment environment for CRE loans. Our target investments provide the opportunity to participate in a CRE market where values have shown positive trends and we believe income growth is expected to continue. Given certain dynamics in the current market including (i) the current growth of the economy; (ii) a low interest rate environment; (iii) low aggregate new CRE supply; and (iv) robust international demand for U.S. CRE, we expect real estate values to trend positively due to increased property-level net operating income, continued strong transaction volume or a combination of both.\nThere continues to be strong competition for CRE lending from banks and non-banking lenders. We believe the more than 30 years of industry experience of our Sub-advisor that has resulted in long-standing financing relationships will provide us access to attractive loan opportunities to compete in this market.\nPortfolio\nWe began operations in October 2016 and our objective is to originate, acquire and manage an investment portfolio of CRE debt and CRE securities that is primarily floating rate and diversified based on the type and location of collateral securing the underlying CRE debt and CRE securities. We anticipate our investment portfolio will be less diversified and have higher concentrations in asset class, collateral type and geographic location until our capital raise reaches levels that will allow for greater diversification.\nThe charts below summarize our portfolio as a percentage of par value by type of rate, loan type, collateral type and geographical region as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nFloating Vs. Fixed Rate:\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestments by Loan Type:\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestments by Property Type:\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestments by Region:\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDecember 31, 2019\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAn investment's region is defined according to the below map based on the location of underlying property.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we raised combined gross proceeds from the Private Offering and IPO (collectively, the Offerings\u201d), including proceeds from the distribution reinvestment plan, of $130,201 and $114,070 respectively. The changes in our portfolio as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 were primarily due to the new loans originated and real estate securities purchased during the period as we invested the proceeds from the Offerings. Due to the small number of investments in our portfolio, the changes in the portfolio composition may be significant. We anticipate that these changes will become less significant as our portfolio increases in size.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans Held for Investment\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal balance of first mortgage loans\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 489,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 241,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of first mortgage loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal balance of credit loans\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of credit loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total balance of loans\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 506,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 251,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total number of loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All-in yield (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ____________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> All-in yield is the present value of all future principal and interest payments on the loan and does not include any origination fees or deferred commitment fees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the size of our portfolio is due to investing capital received from the Offerings and from increased leverage as we executed on our business strategy. The change in our all-in yield was due to change in portfolio composition through the additional loans originated and due to changes in LIBOR. Due to the small number of loans in our portfolio, the all-in yield may change significantly as we continue to originate loans in the future.\nThe tables below present select loan information for each

The change in weighted average interest rate, weighted average yield and weighted average years to maturity were due to the change in the portfolio composition.\nThe change in the ratings of our real estate securities was due to the change in the composition of our assets as we invested the capital from the Offerings. Our credit process evaluates the underlying quality of the loans securing the CMBS at the time of purchase and we continually review the credit performance while we own the CMBS. Our Sub-Advisor performs a quarterly asset review of all our investments and assigns an internal risk rating to each. Each real estate security had a credit rating of 2 as of December 31, 2019. While quarterly reviews were performed for real estate securities, an internal risk rating was not assigned prior to December 31, 2018. See Note 4 - Real Estate Securities,\" which is included in our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Ratings by national rating agencies are subject to change and may not be continuously updated, and therefore we do not place reliance on these ratings.\nWe entered into master repurchase agreements to fund our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had total borrowings of $443,294 (which is net of $80 of unamortized debt issuance costs) and $226,204 (which is net of $77 of unamortized debt issuance costs), respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had weighted average borrowings of $329,037 and $99,221 and weighted average borrowing costs of 4.2% and 4.1%, respectively. The increase in borrowings combined with the proceeds from the Offerings were used to fund the growth in our investment portfolio.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We consider these policies to be critical because they require our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management's judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses\nCommercial mortgage loans are held for investment purposes and are anticipated to be held until maturity. Accordingly, they are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, and premiums or discounts. Commercial mortgage loans that are deemed to be impaired will be carried at amortized cost less a specific allowance for loan losses. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis and related discounts, premiums and net deferred fees or costs on investments are amortized over the life of the\ninvestment using the effective interest method. Amortization is reflected as an adjustment to interest income in our consolidated statements of operations. Upon measurement of impairment, we record an allowance for loan losses to reduce the carrying value of the loan with a corresponding charge through the provision for loan losses on our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe allowance for loan losses reflects management's estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. We use a uniform process for determining our allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component and will include a general, formula-based component when the portfolio is determined to be of sufficient size to warrant such a reserve.\nThe asset-specific reserve component relates to reserves for losses on individual impaired loans. We consider a loan to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, we believe that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. This assessment is made on an individual loan basis each quarter based on such factors as payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. A reserve is established for an impaired loan when the present value of payments expected to be received, observable market prices or the estimated fair value of the collateral (for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment) is lower than the carrying value of that loan.\nFor collateral dependent impaired loans, impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of collateral less the estimated cost to sell. Valuations are performed or obtained at the time a loan is determined to be impaired and designated non-performing, and they are updated if circumstances indicate that a significant change in value has occurred. The Advisor generally will use the income approach through internally developed valuation models to estimate the fair value of the collateral for such loans. In more limited cases, the Advisor will obtain external as is\u201d appraisals for loan collateral, generally when third party participations exist.\nGeneral reserves are recorded when (i) available information as of each balance sheet date indicates that it is probable a loss has occurred in the portfolio and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Our policy is to estimate loss rates based on actual losses experienced, if any, or based on historic realized losses experienced in the industry if we have not experienced any losses. Current collateral and economic conditions affecting the probability and severity of losses are taken into account when establishing the allowance for loan losses. We perform a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings to loans that incorporate management's current judgments about their credit quality based on all known and relevant internal and external factors that may affect collectability. We consider, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographic location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. Ratings range from 1\u201d to 5\u201d with 1\u201d representing the lowest risk of loss and 5\u201d representing the highest risk of loss.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 90 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed against interest income in the period the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding the borrower's ability to make pending principal and interest payments. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to placing a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which changes how entities measure credit losses for financial assets carried at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 eliminates the requirement that a credit loss must be probable before it can be recognized and instead requires an entity to recognize the current estimate of all expected credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for SEC filers for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments may be adopted early for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates\u201d, which grants smaller reporting companies (as defined by the SEC) until reporting periods commencing after December 15, 2022 to implement ASU 2016-13. The Company has elected to use this extension and is continuing to evaluate the impact ASU 2016-13 will have on its allowance for loan losses estimate.\nReal Estate Securities at Fair Value\nOur real estate securities are comprised of CMBS and we have chosen to make a fair value option election pursuant to ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments for our securities and, therefore, our investment securities are recorded at fair market value on the consolidated balance sheets. The periodic changes in fair market value are recorded in current period earnings on the consolidated statements of operations as a component of net unrealized gain (loss) in value of real estate securities. These investments generally\nmeet the requirements to be classified as available-for-sale under ASC Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities, which requires the securities to be carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded to other comprehensive income on our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders' equity. Electing the fair value option permits us to record changes in fair value of our investments in the consolidated statements of operations which, in management's view, more appropriately reflects the results of operations for a particular reporting period.\nWe record our transactions in securities on a trade date basis and recognize realized gains and losses on securities transactions on an identified cost basis.\nResults of Operations\nThe table below presents information from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 116:

The increase in debt finance costs was due to increased fees associated with the increasing of our warehouse lines of credit to fund our CRE loan portfolio. The professional service fees primarily represent legal, audit and tax expenses and increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due to increased activity related to the increase in our investment portfolio. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to increases in bank charges, mortgage servicing fees and miscellaneous expenses. The expense reimbursement was newly implemented during 2019. The Advisor has agreed to reimburse us from time to time for certain costs incurred by us. There were no expense reimbursements during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. These reimbursements represent one-time cash payments to us in order to provide additional operating support to us and ensure a certain return for our stockholders and are not subject to approval from our board of directors. For the year ended December 31, 2019 our total operating expenses were 1.5% of our average invested assets and 55.0% of our net income.\nOther Income (Loss)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, other income (loss) was $989, $(1,279) and $41, respectively. The primary reason for the change in other income (loss) was due to the change in the fair value of the real estate securities resulting from different market conditions during each year.\nNet Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our net income was $13,705 and $2,069, or $1.53 and $0.57 per share (basic and diluted), respectively. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in net interest income as our investment portfolio increased due to investing the proceeds from the Offerings and borrowings. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had net income of $2,069, or $0.57 per share and $81, or $0.11 per share (basic and diluted), respectively. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in investments offset by unrealized losses on real estate securities.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nWe use Funds from Operations ( FFO\u201d), a widely accepted metric, to evaluate our performance. FFO provides a supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to other REITs. Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) has promulgated a standard known as FFO, which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a REIT. As defined by NAREIT, FFO means net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of operating property, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. In addition, NAREIT has further clarified the FFO definition to add-back impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in unconsolidated entities that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate and to exclude the earnings impacts of cumulative effects of accounting changes. We have adopted the NAREIT definition for computing FFO.\nOur business plan is to operate as a mortgage REIT with our portfolio consisting of CRE debt and CRE securities. We will typically have no FFO adjustments to our net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP. Although we have the ability to acquire real property, we have not acquired any at this time and as such have not had any FFO adjustments to our net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP.\nDue to the unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives ( IPA\u201d), an industry trade group, published a standardized measure known as Modified Funds from Operations ( MFFO\u201d), which the IPA has promulgated as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which may be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT.\nThe IPA defines MFFO as FFO adjusted for acquisition fees and expenses, amounts relating to straight line rents and amortization of premiums on debt investments, non-recurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income, non-recurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nWe define MFFO in accordance with the concepts established by the IPA and adjust FFO for certain items, such as amortization of premium and discounts on real estate securities. We purchase real estate securities at a premium or discount to par value, and in accordance with GAAP, record the amortization of premium/accretion of the discount to interest income. We believe that excluding the amortization of premiums and discounts provides better insight to the expected contractual cash flows. In addition, we adjust FFO for unrealized gains or losses on real estate securities. Any mark-to-market or fair value adjustments are based on general market or overall industry conditions and may be temporary in nature.\nBecause MFFO may be a recognized measure of operating performance within the non-listed REIT industry, MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it may be useful in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs. Like FFO, MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, as detailed in the table below, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we continue to acquire a significant amount of investments.\nOur presentation of FFO and MFFO may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other REITs. We believe that the use of FFO and MFFO provides a more complete understanding of our operating performance to stockholders and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs. Neither FFO nor MFFO is intended to be an alternative to net income\u201d or to cash flows from operating activities\u201d as determined by GAAP as a measure of our capacity to pay distributions. Management uses FFO and MFFO to compare our operating performance to that of other REITs and to assess our operating performance.\nNeither the SEC, any other regulatory body nor NAREIT has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, another regulatory body or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.\nOur FFO and MFFO are calculated as follows:\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funds from operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of (discounts) premiums on real estate securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (808\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (369\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized (gain) loss on real estate securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,032\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt finance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Modified funds from operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Asset Value\nPrior to the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price for each class of our common stock in our IPO was $25.00 per share, plus applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees.

Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased due to normal fluctuations and were primarily related to the net proceeds from the Offerings and the net proceeds from our repurchase agreements that were not used to purchase investments.\nOur operating activities generated net cash of $10,078 and $3,228 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The increase from cash provided by operating activities was due to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio. Our operating activities generated net cash of $3,228 and $307 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The increase from cash provided by operating activities was due to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio.\nOur investing activities used $317,580 and $283,090 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The primary driver of the change was due to the origination of mortgage loans and purchase of real estate securities as we invested the proceeds of the Offerings on a levered basis. Our investing activities used $283,090 and $52,777 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The primary driver of the change was due to the origination of mortgage loans and purchase of real estate securities as we invested the proceeds of the Private Offering on a levered basis.\nOur financing activities provided net cash of $316,644 and $306,953 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due to $12,315 greater net proceeds from issuance of our common stock, including redemptions, and $7,383 greater net proceeds from our repurchase agreement financing, partially offset by $10,007 greater distributions paid. Net cash provided by financing activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 due to $190,948 greater net proceeds from our repurchase agreement financing and $67,730 increased net proceeds from issuance of our common stock, including redemptions, partially offset by increased distributions paid of $5,089.\nRepurchase Agreements\nCommercial Mortgage Loans\nOn February 15, 2018, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a master repurchase agreement (the CF Repo Facility\u201d) with Column Financial, Inc. as administrative agent for certain of its affiliates. The CF Repo Facility had an initial advance amount of $100,000 subject to a maximum advance amount of $250,000. We increased the advance amount in August 2018 to $175,000, and in January 2019 to the maximum of $250,000. The initial term of the CF Repo Facility was 12 months and we extended the maturity date in November 2019 to November 2020. Advances under the CF Repo Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.0%. The CF Repo Facility is generally subject to certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nOn May 6, 2019, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an uncommitted master repurchase agreement (the JPM Repo Facility\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association. The JPM Repo Facility provides up to $150,000 in advances. Advances under the JPM Repo Facility accrue interest at per annum rates equal to the sum of (i) the applicable LIBOR index rate plus (ii) a margin of between 1.75% to 2.25%, depending on the attributes of the purchased assets. The initial maturity date of the JPM Repo Facility is May 6, 2021, with two successive one-year extensions at our option, which may be exercised upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The JPM Repo Facility is subject to certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements as of December 31, 2019.\nThe JPM Repo Facility and CF Repo Facility (collectively, the Repo Facilities\u201d) are used to finance eligible loans and act in the manner of a revolving credit facility that can be repaid as our assets are paid off and re-drawn as advances against new assets.\nThe details of the Repo Facilities as of

Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to the factors described below:\n \u2022 Market disruptions may adversely impact many aspects of our operating results and operating condition; \n \u2022 If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund distributions, some or all of our distributions may be paid from other sources, including from the proceeds from sales of our common stock, which will reduce the amount of cash we ultimately have to invest in assets; \n \u2022 There is no current public trading market for our common stock, and we do not expect that such a market will ever develop. Therefore, repurchase of shares by us will likely be the only way for stockholders to dispose of their shares and even if our stockholders are able to sell their shares through our share repurchase program, or otherwise, they may not be able to recover the amount of their investment in our shares; \n \u2022 Our charter generally limits the total amount we may borrow to 300% of our net assets, equivalent to 75% of the costs of our assets; \n \u2022 The Advisor and the Sub-Advisor may face conflicts of interest in allocating personnel and resources between their affiliates; \n \u2022 We do not have arm's-length agreements with the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor or any other affiliates of the Advisor or Sub-Advisor; and \n \u2022 If we fail to qualify as a REIT, our operations and distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected. \nForward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflect our management's view only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false.

We intend for these forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor provisions created by Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All dollar amounts are stated in thousands, except share data.\nOverview\nWe are a Maryland corporation formed on September 13, 2016 to originate, acquire and manage an investment portfolio of CRE investments primarily comprised of (i) CRE debt, including floating-rate first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage and mezzanine loans, and participations in such loans and (ii) floating-rate CRE securities such as CMBS and senior unsecured debt of publicly traded REITs. We may also invest in select equity investments in single-tenant, net leased properties. Substantially all of our business is conducted through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We are externally managed by our Advisor, an indirect subsidiary of Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation. Our Advisor has engaged the Sub-Advisor, a subsidiary of Sound Point, to perform certain services on behalf of the Advisor for us.\nWe have operated in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2017. Among other requirements, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\nOn October 25, 2016, we commenced the Private Offering of up to $500,000 in Class P Shares. Inland Securities Corporation, an affiliate of our Advisor, was our dealer manager for the Private Offering. On June 28, 2019, we terminated the Private Offering in anticipation of selling shares in the IPO (described below). We continued to accept Private Offering subscription proceeds through\nJuly 16, 2019 from subscription agreements executed no later than June 28, 2019. As of July 16, 2019, we had received and accepted investors' subscriptions for and issued 10,258,094 Class P Shares in the Private Offering, resulting in gross proceeds of $276,681.\nOn May 3, 2019, the SEC declared effective the Registration Statement and we commenced our IPO of up to $2,350,000 in shares of our Class A, Class T, Class S, Class D and Class I common stock pursuant to the Registration Statement. Prior to the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price for each class of our common stock in our primary offering was $25.00 per share, plus applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees, and the per share purchase price for shares of our common stock in our distribution reinvestment plan was $25.00. Following the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price per share for each class of common stock varies and generally equals our prior month's NAV per share, as determined monthly, plus applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. The Dealer Manager serves as our exclusive dealer manager for the IPO on a best efforts basis. As of March 10, 2020, we had received and accepted investors' subscriptions for and issued 652,618 Class A Shares, 396,828 Class T Shares, 49,918 Class D Shares and 376,484 Class I Shares in the IPO, resulting in gross proceeds of $38,272. As of March 10, 2020, $2,311,728 of our shares of common stock remained to be sold in the IPO.\nWe used the net proceeds from the Private Offering and IPO to acquire investments in our target assets in accordance with the objectives and strategies described in Item 1, Business\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFactors Impacting Our Operating Results\nOur operating results can be affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on the timing and amount of capital raised, the composition of our investment portfolio, the amount of leverage applied to our investment portfolio and our net interest income. Several macroeconomic factors impact the interest rate environment and our target assets, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\nMarket Conditions\nWe believe the CRE debt sector represents a large market opportunity. According to Trepp - Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Data, the CRE mortgage market is $3.1 trillion and $2.1 trillion in U.S. CRE mortgages are expected to mature during the period 2020 through 2024. We believe the large volume of maturing CRE loans over the next five years and the resulting need for borrowers to refinance assets will provide a significant opportunity to originate CRE debt. In addition, this volume of refinancings does not include the need to finance the purchases of CRE properties, which will provide additional finance opportunities.\nWe believe the current market conditions create a favorable investment environment for CRE loans. Our target investments provide the opportunity to participate in a CRE market where values have shown positive trends and we believe income growth is expected to continue. Given certain dynamics in the current market including (i) the current growth of the economy; (ii) a low interest rate environment; (iii) low aggregate new CRE supply; and (iv) robust international demand for U.S. CRE, we expect real estate values to trend positively due to increased property-level net operating income, continued strong transaction volume or a combination of both.\nThere continues to be strong competition for CRE lending from banks and non-banking lenders. We believe the more than 30 years of industry experience of our Sub-advisor that has resulted in long-standing financing relationships will provide us access to attractive loan opportunities to compete in this market.\nPortfolio\nWe began operations in October 2016 and our objective is to originate, acquire and manage an investment portfolio of CRE debt and CRE securities that is primarily floating rate and diversified based on the type and location of collateral securing the underlying CRE debt and CRE securities. We anticipate our investment portfolio will be less diversified and have higher concentrations in asset class, collateral type and geographic location until our capital raise reaches levels that will allow for greater diversification.\nThe charts below summarize our portfolio as a percentage of par value by type of rate, loan type, collateral type and geographical region as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nFloating Vs.

The changes in our portfolio as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 were primarily due to the new loans originated and real estate securities purchased during the period as we invested the proceeds from the Offerings. Due to the small number of investments in our portfolio, the changes in the portfolio composition may be significant. We anticipate that these changes will become less significant as our portfolio increases in size.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans Held for Investment\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal balance of first mortgage loans\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 489,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 241,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of first mortgage loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal balance of credit loans\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of credit loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total balance of loans\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 506,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 251,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total number of loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All-in yield (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ____________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) All-in yield is the present value of all future principal and interest payments on the loan and does not include any origination fees or deferred commitment fees. \nThe increase in the size of our portfolio is due to investing capital received from the Offerings and from increased leverage as we executed on our business strategy. The change in our all-in yield was due to change in portfolio composition through the additional loans originated and due to changes in LIBOR. Due to the small number of loans in our portfolio, the all-in yield may change significantly as we continue to originate loans in the future.\nThe tables below present select loan information for each

The change in weighted average interest rate, weighted average yield and weighted average years to maturity were due to the change in the portfolio composition.\nThe change in the ratings of our real estate securities was due to the change in the composition of our assets as we invested the capital from the Offerings. Our credit process evaluates the underlying quality of the loans securing the CMBS at the time of purchase and we continually review the credit performance while we own the CMBS. Our Sub-Advisor performs a quarterly asset review of all our investments and assigns an internal risk rating to each. Each real estate security had a credit rating of 2 as of December 31, 2019. While quarterly reviews were performed for real estate securities, an internal risk rating was not assigned prior to December 31, 2018. See Note 4 - Real Estate Securities,\" which is included in our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Ratings by national rating agencies are subject to change and may not be continuously updated, and therefore we do not place reliance on these ratings.\nWe entered into master repurchase agreements to fund our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had total borrowings of $443,294 (which is net of $80 of unamortized debt issuance costs) and $226,204 (which is net of $77 of unamortized debt issuance costs), respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had weighted average borrowings of $329,037 and $99,221 and weighted average borrowing costs of 4.2% and 4.1%, respectively. The increase in borrowings combined with the proceeds from the Offerings were used to fund the growth in our investment portfolio.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We consider these policies to be critical because they require our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management's judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses\nCommercial mortgage loans are held for investment purposes and are anticipated to be held until maturity. Accordingly, they are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, and premiums or discounts. Commercial mortgage loans that are deemed to be impaired will be carried at amortized cost less a specific allowance for loan losses. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis and related discounts, premiums and net deferred fees or costs on investments are amortized over the life of the\ninvestment using the effective interest method. Amortization is reflected as an adjustment to interest income in our consolidated statements of operations. Upon measurement of impairment, we record an allowance for loan losses to reduce the carrying value of the loan with a corresponding charge through the provision for loan losses on our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe allowance for loan losses reflects management's estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. We use a uniform process for determining our allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component and will include a general, formula-based component when the portfolio is determined to be of sufficient size to warrant such a reserve.\nThe asset-specific reserve component relates to reserves for losses on individual impaired loans. We consider a loan to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, we believe that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. This assessment is made on an individual loan basis each quarter based on such factors as payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. A reserve is established for an impaired loan when the present value of payments expected to be received, observable market prices or the estimated fair value of the collateral (for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment) is lower than the carrying value of that loan.\nFor collateral dependent impaired loans, impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of collateral less the estimated cost to sell. Valuations are performed or obtained at the time a loan is determined to be impaired and designated non-performing, and they are updated if circumstances indicate that a significant change in value has occurred. The Advisor generally will use the income approach through internally developed valuation models to estimate the fair value of the collateral for such loans. In more limited cases, the Advisor will obtain external as is\u201d appraisals for loan collateral, generally when third party participations exist.\nGeneral reserves are recorded when (i) available information as of each balance sheet date indicates that it is probable a loss has occurred in the portfolio and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Our policy is to estimate loss rates based on actual losses experienced, if any, or based on historic realized losses experienced in the industry if we have not experienced any losses. Current collateral and economic conditions affecting the probability and severity of losses are taken into account when establishing the allowance for loan losses. We perform a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings to loans that incorporate management's current judgments about their credit quality based on all known and relevant internal and external factors that may affect collectability. We consider, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographic location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. Ratings range from 1\u201d to 5\u201d with 1\u201d representing the lowest risk of loss and 5\u201d representing the highest risk of loss.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 90 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed against interest income in the period the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding the borrower's ability to make pending principal and interest payments. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to placing a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which changes how entities measure credit losses for financial assets carried at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 eliminates the requirement that a credit loss must be probable before it can be recognized and instead requires an entity to recognize the current estimate of all expected credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for SEC filers for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments may be adopted early for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates\u201d, which grants smaller reporting companies (as defined by the SEC) until reporting periods commencing after December 15, 2022 to implement ASU 2016-13. The Company has elected to use this extension and is continuing to evaluate the impact ASU 2016-13 will have on its allowance for loan losses estimate.\nReal Estate Securities at Fair Value\nOur real estate securities are comprised of CMBS and we have chosen to make a fair value option election pursuant to ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments for our securities and, therefore, our investment securities are recorded at fair market value on the consolidated balance sheets. The periodic changes in fair market value are recorded in current period earnings on the consolidated statements of operations as a component of net unrealized gain (loss) in value of real estate securities. These investments generally\nmeet the requirements to be classified as available-for-sale under ASC Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities, which requires the securities to be carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded to other comprehensive income on our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders' equity. Electing the fair value option permits us to record changes in fair value of our investments in the consolidated statements of operations which, in management's view, more appropriately reflects the results of operations for a particular reporting period.\nWe record our transactions in securities on a trade date basis and recognize realized gains and losses on securities transactions on an identified cost basis.\nResults of Operations\nThe table below presents information from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 116:

The change in the weighted average yield and finance cost was due to the change in the portfolio composition as we invested the proceeds from the Offerings and the changes in interest rates tied to LIBOR.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are set forth in the table below:\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Advisory fee\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt finance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Administration expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directors compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional service fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expense reimbursement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (359\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,679\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in the advisory fee during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was due to the Advisor waiving the fee for all periods prior to April 1, 2018 and the increase in the investment portfolio on which the advisory fee is calculated. The increase in debt finance costs was due to increased fees associated with the increasing of our warehouse lines of credit to fund our CRE loan portfolio. The professional service fees primarily represent legal, audit and tax expenses and increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due to increased activity related to the increase in our investment portfolio. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to increases in bank charges, mortgage servicing fees and miscellaneous expenses. The expense reimbursement was newly implemented during 2019. The Advisor has agreed to reimburse us from time to time for certain costs incurred by us. There were no expense reimbursements during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. These reimbursements represent one-time cash payments to us in order to provide additional operating support to us and ensure a certain return for our stockholders and are not subject to approval from our board of directors. For the year ended December 31, 2019 our total operating expenses were 1.5% of our average invested assets and 55.0% of our net income.\nOther Income (Loss)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, other income (loss) was $989, $(1,279) and $41, respectively. The primary reason for the change in other income (loss) was due to the change in the fair value of the real estate securities resulting from different market conditions during each year.\nNet Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our net income was $13,705 and $2,069, or $1.53 and $0.57 per share (basic and diluted), respectively. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in net interest income as our investment portfolio increased due to investing the proceeds from the Offerings and borrowings. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had net income of $2,069, or $0.57 per share and $81, or $0.11 per share (basic and diluted), respectively. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in investments offset by unrealized losses on real estate securities.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nWe use Funds from Operations ( FFO\u201d), a widely accepted metric, to evaluate our performance. FFO provides a supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to other REITs. Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) has promulgated a standard known as FFO, which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a REIT. As defined by NAREIT, FFO means net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of operating property, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. In addition, NAREIT has further clarified the FFO definition to add-back impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in unconsolidated entities that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate and to exclude the earnings impacts of cumulative effects of accounting changes. We have adopted the NAREIT definition for computing FFO.\nOur business plan is to operate as a mortgage REIT with our portfolio consisting of CRE debt and CRE securities. We will typically have no FFO adjustments to our net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP. Although we have the ability to acquire real property, we have not acquired any at this time and as such have not had any FFO adjustments to our net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP.\nDue to the unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives ( IPA\u201d), an industry trade group, published a standardized measure known as Modified Funds from Operations ( MFFO\u201d), which the IPA has promulgated as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which may be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT.\nThe IPA defines MFFO as FFO adjusted for acquisition fees and expenses, amounts relating to straight line rents and amortization of premiums on debt investments, non-recurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income, non-recurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nWe define MFFO in accordance with the concepts established by the IPA and adjust FFO for certain items, such as amortization of premium and discounts on real estate securities. We purchase real estate securities at a premium or discount to par value, and in accordance with GAAP, record the amortization of premium/accretion of the discount to interest income. We believe that excluding the amortization of premiums and discounts provides better insight to the expected contractual cash flows. In addition, we adjust FFO for unrealized gains or losses on real estate securities. Any mark-to-market or fair value adjustments are based on general market or overall industry conditions and may be temporary in nature.\nBecause MFFO may be a recognized measure of operating performance within the non-listed REIT industry, MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it may be useful in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs. Like FFO, MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, as detailed in the table below, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we continue to acquire a significant amount of investments.\nOur presentation of FFO and MFFO may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other REITs. We believe that the use of FFO and MFFO provides a more complete understanding of our operating performance to stockholders and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs. Neither FFO nor MFFO is intended to be an alternative to net income\u201d or to cash flows from operating activities\u201d as determined by GAAP as a measure of our capacity to pay distributions. Management uses FFO and MFFO to compare our operating performance to that of other REITs and to assess our operating performance.\nNeither the SEC, any other regulatory body nor NAREIT has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, another regulatory body or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.\nOur FFO and MFFO are calculated as follows:\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funds from operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of (discounts) premiums on real estate securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (808\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (369\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized (gain) loss on real estate securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,032\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt finance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Modified funds from operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Asset Value\nPrior to the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price for each class of our common stock in our IPO was $25.00 per share, plus applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. Following the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price per share for each class of our common stock in our IPO generally equals our prior month's NAV per share, as determined monthly, plus applicable selling commissions and dealer manager fees. Our NAV for each class of shares is based on the net asset values of our investments, the addition of any other assets (such as cash on hand) and the deduction of any liabilities, including the allocation/accrual of any performance participation and any stockholder servicing fees applicable to such class of shares.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the major components of our NAV as of December 31, 2019 ($ and shares in thousands):\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> Components of NAV\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial mortgage loans\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 511,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 157,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchase agreements - commercial mortgage loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (335,805\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchase agreements - real estate securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (107,489\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due to related parties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (698\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distributions payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,699\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (652\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accrued stockholder servicing fees(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (514\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net asset value\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 267,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of outstanding shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ____________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Stockholder servicing fees only apply to Class T, Class S, and Class D shares. For purposes of NAV, we recognize the stockholder servicing fee as a reduction of NAV on a monthly basis as such fee is paid. Under GAAP, we accrue the full cost of the stockholder servicing fee as an offering cost at the time we sell Class T, Class S and Class D shares. As of December 31, 2019, we have accrued under GAAP $187 of stockholder servicing fees payable to the Dealer Manager related to the Class T shares sold and $90 of stockholder servicing fees payable to the Dealer Manager related to the Class D shares sold. As of December 31, 2019, we have not sold any Class S shares and, therefore, we have not accrued any stockholder servicing fees payable to the Dealer Manager related to Class S shares. The Dealer Manager does not retain any of these fees, all of which are retained by, or reallowed (paid) to, participating broker-dealers and servicing broker-dealers for ongoing stockholder services performed by such broker-dealers. \nThe table below outlines our total NAV and NAV per share by share class as of December 31, 2019 ($ and shares in thousands except for per share data):\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Common Stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NAV Per Share\n</td> <td> Class A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Class T\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Class S\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Class D\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Class I\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Monthly NAV\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of outstanding shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NAV per share as of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25.0433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25.0412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25.0392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25.0526\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table reconciles stockholders' equity per our consolidated balance sheet to our NAV:\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> Reconciliation of Stockholders' Equity to NAV\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stockholders' equity per GAAP\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 256,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unamortized stockholder servicing fee\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unamortized offering costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value loan adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net asset value\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 267,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to pay distributions to our stockholders, fund investments, originate loans, repay borrowings, and other general business needs including the payment of our operating and administrative expenses.

Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased due to normal fluctuations and were primarily related to the net proceeds from the Offerings and the net proceeds from our repurchase agreements that were not used to purchase investments.\nOur operating activities generated net cash of $10,078 and $3,228 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The increase from cash provided by operating activities was due to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio. Our operating activities generated net cash of $3,228 and $307 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The increase from cash provided by operating activities was due to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio.\nOur investing activities used $317,580 and $283,090 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The primary driver of the change was due to the origination of mortgage loans and purchase of real estate securities as we invested the proceeds of the Offerings on a levered basis. Our investing activities used $283,090 and $52,777 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The primary driver of the change was due to the origination of mortgage loans and purchase of real estate securities as we invested the proceeds of the Private Offering on a levered basis.\nOur financing activities provided net cash of $316,644 and $306,953 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due to $12,315 greater net proceeds from issuance of our common stock, including redemptions, and $7,383 greater net proceeds from our repurchase agreement financing, partially offset by $10,007 greater distributions paid. Net cash provided by financing activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 due to $190,948 greater net proceeds from our repurchase agreement financing and $67,730 increased net proceeds from issuance of our common stock, including redemptions, partially offset by increased distributions paid of $5,089.\nRepurchase Agreements\nCommercial Mortgage Loans\nOn February 15, 2018, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a master repurchase agreement (the CF Repo Facility\u201d) with Column Financial, Inc. as administrative agent for certain of its affiliates. The CF Repo Facility had an initial advance amount of $100,000 subject to a maximum advance amount of $250,000. We increased the advance amount in August 2018 to $175,000, and in January 2019 to the maximum of $250,000. The initial term of the CF Repo Facility was 12 months and we extended the maturity date in November 2019 to November 2020. Advances under the CF Repo Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.0%. The CF Repo Facility is generally subject to certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nOn May 6, 2019, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an uncommitted master repurchase agreement (the JPM Repo Facility\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association. The JPM Repo Facility provides up to $150,000 in advances. Advances under the JPM Repo Facility accrue interest at per annum rates equal to the sum of (i) the applicable LIBOR index rate plus (ii) a margin of between 1.75% to 2.25%, depending on the attributes of the purchased assets. The initial maturity date of the JPM Repo Facility is May 6, 2021, with two successive one-year extensions at our option, which may be exercised upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The JPM Repo Facility is subject to certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements as of December 31, 2019.\nThe JPM Repo Facility and CF Repo Facility (collectively, the Repo Facilities\u201d) are used to finance eligible loans and act in the manner of a revolving credit facility that can be repaid as our assets are paid off and re-drawn as advances against new assets.\nThe details of the Repo Facilities as of

Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to the factors described below:\n \u2022 Market disruptions may adversely impact many aspects of our operating results and operating condition; \n \u2022 If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund distributions, some or all of our distributions may be paid from other sources, including from the proceeds from sales of our common stock, which will reduce the amount of cash we ultimately have to invest in assets; \n \u2022 There is no current public trading market for our common stock, and we do not expect that such a market will ever develop. Therefore, repurchase of shares by us will likely be the only way for stockholders to dispose of their shares and even if our stockholders are able to sell their shares through our share repurchase program, or otherwise, they may not be able to recover the amount of their investment in our shares; \n \u2022 Our charter generally limits the total amount we may borrow to 300% of our net assets, equivalent to 75% of the costs of our assets; \n \u2022 The Advisor and the Sub-Advisor may face conflicts of interest in allocating personnel and resources between their affiliates; \n \u2022 We do not have arm's-length agreements with the Advisor, the Sub-Advisor or any other affiliates of the Advisor or Sub-Advisor; and \n \u2022 If we fail to qualify as a REIT, our operations and distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected. \nForward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflect our management's view only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results except as required by applicable law. We intend for these forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor provisions created by Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All dollar amounts are stated in thousands, except share data.\nOverview\nWe are a Maryland corporation formed on September 13, 2016 to originate, acquire and manage an investment portfolio of CRE investments primarily comprised of (i) CRE debt, including floating-rate first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage and mezzanine loans, and participations in such loans and (ii) floating-rate CRE securities such as CMBS and senior unsecured debt of publicly traded REITs. We may also invest in select equity investments in single-tenant, net leased properties. Substantially all of our business is conducted through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We are externally managed by our Advisor, an indirect subsidiary of Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation. Our Advisor has engaged the Sub-Advisor, a subsidiary of Sound Point, to perform certain services on behalf of the Advisor for us.\nWe have operated in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 2017. Among other requirements, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\nOn October 25, 2016, we commenced the Private Offering of up to $500,000 in Class P Shares. Inland Securities Corporation, an affiliate of our Advisor, was our dealer manager for the Private Offering. On June 28, 2019, we terminated the Private Offering in anticipation of selling shares in the IPO (described below). We continued to accept Private Offering subscription proceeds through\nJuly 16, 2019 from subscription agreements executed no later than June 28, 2019. As of July 16, 2019, we had received and accepted investors' subscriptions for and issued 10,258,094 Class P Shares in the Private Offering, resulting in gross proceeds of $276,681.\nOn May 3, 2019, the SEC declared effective the Registration Statement and we commenced our IPO of up to $2,350,000 in shares of our Class A, Class T, Class S, Class D and Class I common stock pursuant to the Registration Statement. Prior to the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price for each class of our common stock in our primary offering was $25.00 per share, plus applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees, and the per share purchase price for shares of our common stock in our distribution reinvestment plan was $25.00. Following the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price per share for each class of common stock varies and generally equals our prior month's NAV per share, as determined monthly, plus applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. The Dealer Manager serves as our exclusive dealer manager for the IPO on a best efforts basis. As of March 10, 2020, we had received and accepted investors' subscriptions for and issued 652,618 Class A Shares, 396,828 Class T Shares, 49,918 Class D Shares and 376,484 Class I Shares in the IPO, resulting in gross proceeds of $38,272. As of March 10, 2020, $2,311,728 of our shares of common stock remained to be sold in the IPO.\nWe used the net proceeds from the Private Offering and IPO to acquire investments in our target assets in accordance with the objectives and strategies described in Item 1, Business\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFactors Impacting Our Operating Results\nOur operating results can be affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on the timing and amount of capital raised, the composition of our investment portfolio, the amount of leverage applied to our investment portfolio and our net interest income. Several macroeconomic factors impact the interest rate environment and our target assets, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\nMarket Conditions\nWe believe the CRE debt sector represents a large market opportunity. According to Trepp - Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Data, the CRE mortgage market is $3.1 trillion and $2.1 trillion in U.S. CRE mortgages are expected to mature during the period 2020 through 2024. We believe the large volume of maturing CRE loans over the next five years and the resulting need for borrowers to refinance assets will provide a significant opportunity to originate CRE debt. In addition, this volume of refinancings does not include the need to finance the purchases of CRE properties, which will provide additional finance opportunities.\nWe believe the current market conditions create a favorable investment environment for CRE loans. Our target investments provide the opportunity to participate in a CRE market where values have shown positive trends and we believe income growth is expected to continue. Given certain dynamics in the current market including (i) the current growth of the economy; (ii) a low interest rate environment; (iii) low aggregate new CRE supply; and (iv) robust international demand for U.S. CRE, we expect real estate values to trend positively due to increased property-level net operating income, continued strong transaction volume or a combination of both.\nThere continues to be strong competition for CRE lending from banks and non-banking lenders. We believe the more than 30 years of industry experience of our Sub-advisor that has resulted in long-standing financing relationships will provide us access to attractive loan opportunities to compete in this market.\nPortfolio\nWe began operations in October 2016 and our objective is to originate, acquire and manage an investment portfolio of CRE debt and CRE securities that is primarily floating rate and diversified based on the type and location of collateral securing the underlying CRE debt and CRE securities. We anticipate our investment portfolio will be less diversified and have higher concentrations in asset class, collateral type and geographic location until our capital raise reaches levels that will allow for greater diversification.\nThe charts below summarize our portfolio as a percentage of par value by type of rate, loan type, collateral type and geographical region as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nFloating Vs. Fixed Rate:\n\nInvestments by Loan Type:\n\nInvestments by Property Type:\n\nInvestments by Region:\n\nAn investment's region is defined according to the below map based on the location of underlying property.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we raised combined gross proceeds from the Private Offering and IPO (collectively, the Offerings\u201d), including proceeds from the distribution reinvestment plan, of $130,201 and $114,070 respectively. The changes in our portfolio as of December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 were primarily due to the new loans originated and real estate securities purchased during the period as we invested the proceeds from the Offerings. Due to the small number of investments in our portfolio, the changes in the portfolio composition may be significant. We anticipate that these changes will become less significant as our portfolio increases in size.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans Held for Investment\n\n (1) All-in yield is the present value of all future principal and interest payments on the loan and does not include any origination fees or deferred commitment fees. \nThe increase in the size of our portfolio is due to investing capital received from the Offerings and from increased leverage as we executed on our business strategy. The change in our all-in yield was due to change in portfolio composition through the additional loans originated and due to changes in LIBOR. Due to the small number of loans in our portfolio, the all-in yield may change significantly as we continue to originate loans in the future.\nThe tables below present select loan information for each of our commercial mortgage loans as of:\nDecember 31, 2019\n\nDecember 31, 2018\n\n (1) First mortgage loans are first position mortgage loans and credit loans are mezzanine and subordinated loans. \n (2) Cash coupon is the stated rate on the loan. All-in yield is the present value of all future principal and interest payments on the loan and does not include any origination fees or deferred commitment fees. The total is the weighted average rate as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 using LIBOR of 1.76250% and 2.50269%, respectively. \n (3) Original maturity is the first maturity on the loan and the maximum maturity assumes all extension options are exercised. \n (4) Loan-to-value ( LTV\u201d) was determined at loan origination and is not updated for subsequent property valuations or loan modifications. The total is the weighted average LTV. \n (5) Risk rating is the internal risk rating assigned by the Sub-Advisor. The total is the average rating for the portfolio. See Note 3 - Commercial Mortgage Loans Held for Investment,\" which is included in our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n (6) Cash coupon increases to L+5.30% on the payment date in January 2020. \nReal Estate Securities\nThe table below provides a summary of our real estate securities portfolio:\n\n (1) The weighted average interest rate is based off the balance of the bonds outstanding and the applicable rates. \n (2) The weighted average yield is calculated as interest income divided by the average carrying value. \nThe increase in the size of our real estate securities portfolio is due to investing the proceeds of the Offerings on a levered basis to purchase additional real estate securities. The change in weighted average interest rate, weighted average yield and weighted average years to maturity were due to the change in the portfolio composition.\nThe change in the ratings of our real estate securities was due to the change in the composition of our assets as we invested the capital from the Offerings. Our credit process evaluates the underlying quality of the loans securing the CMBS at the time of purchase and we continually review the credit performance while we own the CMBS. Our Sub-Advisor performs a quarterly asset review of all our investments and assigns an internal risk rating to each. Each real estate security had a credit rating of 2 as of December 31, 2019. While quarterly reviews were performed for real estate securities, an internal risk rating was not assigned prior to December 31, 2018. See Note 4 - Real Estate Securities,\" which is included in our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Ratings by national rating agencies are subject to change and may not be continuously updated, and therefore we do not place reliance on these ratings.\nWe entered into master repurchase agreements to fund our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had total borrowings of $443,294 (which is net of $80 of unamortized debt issuance costs) and $226,204 (which is net of $77 of unamortized debt issuance costs), respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had weighted average borrowings of $329,037 and $99,221 and weighted average borrowing costs of 4.2% and 4.1%, respectively. The increase in borrowings combined with the proceeds from the Offerings were used to fund the growth in our investment portfolio.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We consider these policies to be critical because they require our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management's judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses\nCommercial mortgage loans are held for investment purposes and are anticipated to be held until maturity. Accordingly, they are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, and premiums or discounts. Commercial mortgage loans that are deemed to be impaired will be carried at amortized cost less a specific allowance for loan losses. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis and related discounts, premiums and net deferred fees or costs on investments are amortized over the life of the\ninvestment using the effective interest method. Amortization is reflected as an adjustment to interest income in our consolidated statements of operations. Upon measurement of impairment, we record an allowance for loan losses to reduce the carrying value of the loan with a corresponding charge through the provision for loan losses on our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe allowance for loan losses reflects management's estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. We use a uniform process for determining our allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component and will include a general, formula-based component when the portfolio is determined to be of sufficient size to warrant such a reserve.\nThe asset-specific reserve component relates to reserves for losses on individual impaired loans. We consider a loan to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, we believe that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. This assessment is made on an individual loan basis each quarter based on such factors as payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. A reserve is established for an impaired loan when the present value of payments expected to be received, observable market prices or the estimated fair value of the collateral (for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment) is lower than the carrying value of that loan.\nFor collateral dependent impaired loans, impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of collateral less the estimated cost to sell. Valuations are performed or obtained at the time a loan is determined to be impaired and designated non-performing, and they are updated if circumstances indicate that a significant change in value has occurred. The Advisor generally will use the income approach through internally developed valuation models to estimate the fair value of the collateral for such loans. In more limited cases, the Advisor will obtain external as is\u201d appraisals for loan collateral, generally when third party participations exist.\nGeneral reserves are recorded when (i) available information as of each balance sheet date indicates that it is probable a loss has occurred in the portfolio and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Our policy is to estimate loss rates based on actual losses experienced, if any, or based on historic realized losses experienced in the industry if we have not experienced any losses. Current collateral and economic conditions affecting the probability and severity of losses are taken into account when establishing the allowance for loan losses. We perform a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings to loans that incorporate management's current judgments about their credit quality based on all known and relevant internal and external factors that may affect collectability. We consider, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographic location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. Ratings range from 1\u201d to 5\u201d with 1\u201d representing the lowest risk of loss and 5\u201d representing the highest risk of loss.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 90 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed against interest income in the period the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding the borrower's ability to make pending principal and interest payments. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to placing a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which changes how entities measure credit losses for financial assets carried at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 eliminates the requirement that a credit loss must be probable before it can be recognized and instead requires an entity to recognize the current estimate of all expected credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for SEC filers for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments may be adopted early for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates\u201d, which grants smaller reporting companies (as defined by the SEC) until reporting periods commencing after December 15, 2022 to implement ASU 2016-13. The Company has elected to use this extension and is continuing to evaluate the impact ASU 2016-13 will have on its allowance for loan losses estimate.\nReal Estate Securities at Fair Value\nOur real estate securities are comprised of CMBS and we have chosen to make a fair value option election pursuant to ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments for our securities and, therefore, our investment securities are recorded at fair market value on the consolidated balance sheets. The periodic changes in fair market value are recorded in current period earnings on the consolidated statements of operations as a component of net unrealized gain (loss) in value of real estate securities. These investments generally\nmeet the requirements to be classified as available-for-sale under ASC Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities, which requires the securities to be carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded to other comprehensive income on our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders' equity. Electing the fair value option permits us to record changes in fair value of our investments in the consolidated statements of operations which, in management's view, more appropriately reflects the results of operations for a particular reporting period.\nWe record our transactions in securities on a trade date basis and recognize realized gains and losses on securities transactions on an identified cost basis.\nResults of Operations\nThe table below presents information from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n\nThe change in performance from December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019 generally resulted from the investment of the proceeds from the Offerings in CRE investments on a levered basis. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the ratio of the cost of raising equity capital to the gross amount of equity capital raised was approximately 8.4%.\nThe change in performance from December 31, 2017 to the year ended December 31, 2018 generally resulted from the investment of the proceeds from the Private Offering in CRE investments on a levered basis.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is generated on our interest-earning assets less related interest-bearing liabilities. The following table presents the average balance of interest-earning assets less related interest-bearing liabilities, associated interest income and expense and corresponding yield earned and incurred for the periods indicated.\n\n (1) Based on amortized cost for real estate securities and principal amount for repurchase agreements. Amounts are calculated based on the average daily balance. \n (2) Includes the effect of amortization of premium or accretion of discount. \n (3) Interest income excludes $699 and $72 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to bank deposits and Treasury bills not included in the investment portfolio. \n (4) Calculated as interest income or expense divided by average carrying value. \n (5) Calculated by dividing total average interest-bearing liabilities by total average equity (total average interest-earning assets less total average liabilities). \n (6) Calculated by taking the sum of (i) the net interest spread multiplied by the average leverage and (ii) the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets. \nThe increase in our weighted average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities was due to the investment of proceeds from the Offerings and through increased leverage as we executed our business strategy. The change in the weighted average yield and finance cost was due to the change in the portfolio composition as we invested the proceeds from the Offerings and the changes in interest rates tied to LIBOR.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are set forth in the table below:\n\nThe increase in the advisory fee during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was due to the Advisor waiving the fee for all periods prior to April 1, 2018 and the increase in the investment portfolio on which the advisory fee is calculated. The increase in debt finance costs was due to increased fees associated with the increasing of our warehouse lines of credit to fund our CRE loan portfolio. The professional service fees primarily represent legal, audit and tax expenses and increased during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due to increased activity related to the increase in our investment portfolio. The increase in other expenses was primarily due to increases in bank charges, mortgage servicing fees and miscellaneous expenses. The expense reimbursement was newly implemented during 2019. The Advisor has agreed to reimburse us from time to time for certain costs incurred by us. There were no expense reimbursements during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. These reimbursements represent one-time cash payments to us in order to provide additional operating support to us and ensure a certain return for our stockholders and are not subject to approval from our board of directors. For the year ended December 31, 2019 our total operating expenses were 1.5% of our average invested assets and 55.0% of our net income.\nOther Income (Loss)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, other income (loss) was $989, $(1,279) and $41, respectively. The primary reason for the change in other income (loss) was due to the change in the fair value of the real estate securities resulting from different market conditions during each year.\nNet Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our net income was $13,705 and $2,069, or $1.53 and $0.57 per share (basic and diluted), respectively. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in net interest income as our investment portfolio increased due to investing the proceeds from the Offerings and borrowings. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had net income of $2,069, or $0.57 per share and $81, or $0.11 per share (basic and diluted), respectively. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in investments offset by unrealized losses on real estate securities.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nWe use Funds from Operations ( FFO\u201d), a widely accepted metric, to evaluate our performance. FFO provides a supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to other REITs. Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) has promulgated a standard known as FFO, which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a REIT. As defined by NAREIT, FFO means net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of operating property, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. In addition, NAREIT has further clarified the FFO definition to add-back impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in unconsolidated entities that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate and to exclude the earnings impacts of cumulative effects of accounting changes. We have adopted the NAREIT definition for computing FFO.\nOur business plan is to operate as a mortgage REIT with our portfolio consisting of CRE debt and CRE securities. We will typically have no FFO adjustments to our net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP. Although we have the ability to acquire real property, we have not acquired any at this time and as such have not had any FFO adjustments to our net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP.\nDue to the unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives ( IPA\u201d), an industry trade group, published a standardized measure known as Modified Funds from Operations ( MFFO\u201d), which the IPA has promulgated as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which may be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT.\nThe IPA defines MFFO as FFO adjusted for acquisition fees and expenses, amounts relating to straight line rents and amortization of premiums on debt investments, non-recurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income, non-recurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nWe define MFFO in accordance with the concepts established by the IPA and adjust FFO for certain items, such as amortization of premium and discounts on real estate securities. We purchase real estate securities at a premium or discount to par value, and in accordance with GAAP, record the amortization of premium/accretion of the discount to interest income. We believe that excluding the amortization of premiums and discounts provides better insight to the expected contractual cash flows. In addition, we adjust FFO for unrealized gains or losses on real estate securities. Any mark-to-market or fair value adjustments are based on general market or overall industry conditions and may be temporary in nature.\nBecause MFFO may be a recognized measure of operating performance within the non-listed REIT industry, MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it may be useful in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs. Like FFO, MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, as detailed in the table below, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we continue to acquire a significant amount of investments.\nOur presentation of FFO and MFFO may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other REITs. We believe that the use of FFO and MFFO provides a more complete understanding of our operating performance to stockholders and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs. Neither FFO nor MFFO is intended to be an alternative to net income\u201d or to cash flows from operating activities\u201d as determined by GAAP as a measure of our capacity to pay distributions. Management uses FFO and MFFO to compare our operating performance to that of other REITs and to assess our operating performance.\nNeither the SEC, any other regulatory body nor NAREIT has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, another regulatory body or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.\nOur FFO and MFFO are calculated as follows:\n\nNet Asset Value\nPrior to the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price for each class of our common stock in our IPO was $25.00 per share, plus applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. Following the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price per share for each class of our common stock in our IPO generally equals our prior month's NAV per share, as determined monthly, plus applicable selling commissions and dealer manager fees. Our NAV for each class of shares is based on the net asset values of our investments, the addition of any other assets (such as cash on hand) and the deduction of any liabilities, including the allocation/accrual of any performance participation and any stockholder servicing fees applicable to such class of shares.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the major components of our NAV as of December 31, 2019 ($ and shares in thousands):\n\n (1) Stockholder servicing fees only apply to Class T, Class S, and Class D shares. For purposes of NAV, we recognize the stockholder servicing fee as a reduction of NAV on a monthly basis as such fee is paid. Under GAAP, we accrue the full cost of the stockholder servicing fee as an offering cost at the time we sell Class T, Class S and Class D shares. As of December 31, 2019, we have accrued under GAAP $187 of stockholder servicing fees payable to the Dealer Manager related to the Class T shares sold and $90 of stockholder servicing fees payable to the Dealer Manager related to the Class D shares sold. As of December 31, 2019, we have not sold any Class S shares and, therefore, we have not accrued any stockholder servicing fees payable to the Dealer Manager related to Class S shares. The Dealer Manager does not retain any of these fees, all of which are retained by, or reallowed (paid) to, participating broker-dealers and servicing broker-dealers for ongoing stockholder services performed by such broker-dealers. \nThe table below outlines our total NAV and NAV per share by share class as of December 31, 2019 ($ and shares in thousands except for per share data):\n\nThe following table reconciles stockholders' equity per our consolidated balance sheet to our NAV:\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to pay distributions to our stockholders, fund investments, originate loans, repay borrowings, and other general business needs including the payment of our operating and administrative expenses. Our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of the net proceeds from the Offerings, net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from repurchase agreements and other financing arrangements and future issuances of equity and/or debt securities.\nWe currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for all anticipated uses, including the acquisition of additional investments, required debt service and the payment of distributions to stockholders.\nCash Flow Analysis\n\nWe held cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $37,639, $28,497, and $1,406 as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased due to normal fluctuations and were primarily related to the net proceeds from the Offerings and the net proceeds from our repurchase agreements that were not used to purchase investments.\nOur operating activities generated net cash of $10,078 and $3,228 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The increase from cash provided by operating activities was due to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio. Our operating activities generated net cash of $3,228 and $307 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The increase from cash provided by operating activities was due to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio.\nOur investing activities used $317,580 and $283,090 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The primary driver of the change was due to the origination of mortgage loans and purchase of real estate securities as we invested the proceeds of the Offerings on a levered basis. Our investing activities used $283,090 and $52,777 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The primary driver of the change was due to the origination of mortgage loans and purchase of real estate securities as we invested the proceeds of the Private Offering on a levered basis.\nOur financing activities provided net cash of $316,644 and $306,953 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due to $12,315 greater net proceeds from issuance of our common stock, including redemptions, and $7,383 greater net proceeds from our repurchase agreement financing, partially offset by $10,007 greater distributions paid. Net cash provided by financing activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 due to $190,948 greater net proceeds from our repurchase agreement financing and $67,730 increased net proceeds from issuance of our common stock, including redemptions, partially offset by increased distributions paid of $5,089.\nRepurchase Agreements\nCommercial Mortgage Loans\nOn February 15, 2018, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a master repurchase agreement (the CF Repo Facility\u201d) with Column Financial, Inc. as administrative agent for certain of its affiliates. The CF Repo Facility had an initial advance amount of $100,000 subject to a maximum advance amount of $250,000. We increased the advance amount in August 2018 to $175,000, and in January 2019 to the maximum of $250,000. The initial term of the CF Repo Facility was 12 months and we extended the maturity date in November 2019 to November 2020. Advances under the CF Repo Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.0%. The CF Repo Facility is generally subject to certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nOn May 6, 2019, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an uncommitted master repurchase agreement (the JPM Repo Facility\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association. The JPM Repo Facility provides up to $150,000 in advances. Advances under the JPM Repo Facility accrue interest at per annum rates equal to the sum of (i) the applicable LIBOR index rate plus (ii) a margin of between 1.75% to 2.25%, depending on the attributes of the purchased assets. The initial maturity date of the JPM Repo Facility is May 6, 2021, with two successive one-year extensions at our option, which may be exercised upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The JPM Repo Facility is subject to certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements as of December 31, 2019.\nThe JPM Repo Facility and CF Repo Facility (collectively, the Repo Facilities\u201d) are used to finance eligible loans and act in the manner of a revolving credit facility that can be repaid as our assets are paid off and re-drawn as advances against new assets.\nThe details of the Repo Facilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows:\n\n\n (1) Excluding $80 and $77 of unamortized debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nReal Estate Securities\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had entered into two master repurchase agreements for real estate securities with separate counterparties and had the following balances outstanding as described in the table below:\n\nDistributions\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 and for the period from January 1, 2019 to July 31, 2019, we paid distributions on Class P Shares based on daily record dates, payable in arrears the following month, equal to a daily amount of 1/365th of $1.92 per share. Distributions declared on or after August 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 on Class P Shares are based on monthly record dates, payable in arrears the following month, equal to a monthly amount of 1/12th of $1.92 per share.\nFor each class of common stock offered in the IPO, we pay the same gross distribution based on monthly record dates, payable in arrears the following month, equal to a monthly amount of 1/12th of $1.62 per share from August 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid a monthly gross distribution of 1/12th of $1.62 per share on our Class A and Class D common stock to stockholders of record beginning in the month of September and on our Class T and Class I common stock to stockholders of record beginning in the month of August. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not have shares outstanding of Class A, Class T, Class S, Class D or Class I common stock.\n\n (1) For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, 38.3%, 49.0% and 75.1% of distributions were paid from the net combined proceeds of our Private Offering and IPO, respectively. \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur contractual obligations, excluding expected interest payments, as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are summarized as follows:\n\n (1) Excluding $80 and $77 of unamortized debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nWe have made a commitment to advance additional funds under certain of our CRE loans if the borrower meets certain conditions. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had 22 and 13 CRE loans, respectively, with a total remaining future funding commitment of $54,620 and $30,343, respectively. The future funding commitments are advanced at our discretion if the borrower has requested the advance and has met certain loan specific requirements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nReview of our Policies\nOur board of directors, including our independent directors, has reviewed our policies described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our registration statement and determined that they are in the best interests of our stockholders because: (i) they increase the\nlikelihood that we will be able to originate, acquire and manage a diversified portfolio of first mortgage loans secured by CRE and credit loans, thereby reducing risk in our portfolio; (ii) there are sufficient loan underwriting opportunities with the attributes that we seek; (iii) our executive officers, director, affiliates of our Advisor and Sub-Advisor have expertise with the type of real estate investments we seek; and (iv) our borrowings will enable us to originate and acquire loan assets and earn revenue more quickly, thereby increasing our likelihood of generating income for our stockholders and preserving stockholder capital.", "item_7_tables": "Table 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr>

</tr>\n</table>", "summary": "This analysis provides an in-depth look at the financial operations and condition of a company during a specific reporting period, as outlined in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. The report starts by discussing forward-looking statements that are based on management's beliefs, expectations, and current knowledge which might not be reliable indicators of future performance due to risks and uncertainties.\n\nThe Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section provides a narrative explanation of the financial statements and includes forward-looking statements. The MD&A emphasizes that the company's statements might not be entirely accurate as they are subject to market disruptions, cash flow sufficiency, the absence of a public trading market for common stock, borrowing limits, conflicts of interest between the Advisor and Sub-Advisor, and threats to the company's REIT status.\n\nThe company is a Maryland corporation focused on CRE investments through debt instruments like first mortgage loans and CRE securities. It conducts most of its business through its Operating Partnership and is externally managed by its Advisor, which is a subsidiary of Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation.\n\nAs of July 19, 2019, the company raised substantial gross proceeds through its Private Offering, and as of March 10, 2020, a significant amount of common stock remained to be sold in the IPO. The investment portfolio, primarily floating rate and diversified across asset types and locations, generates the company's revenue.\n\nThe company's operating results are influenced by factors such as market conditions, portfolio composition, leverage, and net interest income. The CRE debt sector is a significant market opportunity, with a vast amount of CRE mortgages expected to mature in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe report provides a detailed breakdown of the composition of the company's portfolio by loan type, property type, geographical region, and whether the rate is fixed or floating. It also elaborates on the commercial mortgage loans held for investment, their yield, balance, and characteristics.\n\nThe company details its critical accounting policies, particularly relating to commercial mortgage loans and real estate securities valuation. The results of its operations are tabulated, highlighting the income from interest, operating expenses, and other income or losses resulting in net income before taxes.\n\nIt uses Funds from Operations (FFO) and Modified Funds from Operations (MFFO) as non-GAAP measures to assess performance. It outlines its liquidity and capital resources, including cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities.\n\nLastly, the company's contractual obligations and commitments, including repurchase agreements and future funding commitments for CRE loans, are detailed. The report concludes with a review of the company's policies by its board of directors."}
