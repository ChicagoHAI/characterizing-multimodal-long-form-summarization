Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of patients with cancer. Our first product approved by the FDA, COSELA\u2122 (trilaciclib), is the first and only therapy indicated to proactively help protect bone marrow from the damage of chemotherapy and is the first innovation in managing myeloprotection in decades.\nWe shall use COSELA\u201d when referring to our FDA approved drug and trilaciclib\u201d when referring to our development of COSELA for additional indications.\nCOSELA is a prescription medicine used to help reduce the occurrence of low blood cell counts caused by damage to bone marrow from chemotherapy. COSELA is used to treat adults taking certain chemotherapies (platinum/etoposide or topotecan) for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.\nCOSELA is an injection for intravenous (IV) use given within 4 hours before chemotherapy.\nCommercial Product\nOn February 12, 2021, COSELA (trilaciclib) for injection was approved by the FDA to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in adult patients treated with a platinum/etoposide-containing regimen or topotecan-containing regimen for ES-SCLC. We are also exploring potential use of trilaciclib in a variety of tumors, including colorectal cancer ( CRC\u201d), breast cancer, bladder cancer, and in trials designed to inform the design of future additional pivotal studies across multiple tumor types and treatment combinations including targeted chemotherapy medicines called antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).\nIn June 2020, we entered into a three-year co-promotion agreement for COSELA in the United States and Puerto Rico with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In December 2021, G1 and Boehringer Ingelheim mutually agreed to end the co-promotion agreement for COSELA, effective March 2022. At that time, the Company announced that it would hire and deploy a total of 34 oncology sales representatives to allow G1 to target all accounts to accelerate sales activities and help maximize the adoption of COSELA. As of February 21, 2022, all 34 sales representatives have been hired, trained, and deployed.\nProduct Pipeline\nTrilaciclib is a first-in-class therapy designed to help protect against chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression.\nWe are executing on our tumor-agnostic strategy to evaluate the potential benefits of trilaciclib to patients with other tumors to continuously develop new data with trilaciclib in a variety of chemotherapeutic settings and in combination with other agents to maximize the applicability of the drug to potential future treatment paradigms. We currently have five on-going clinical trials: a pivotal trial in 1L colorectal cancer ( CRC\u201d), a pivotal trial in 1L mTNBC, a Phase 2 1L bladder cancer trial with chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor, a Phase 2 trial designed to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and myeloprotective benefit of trilaciclib administered prior to an antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC\u201d), and a Phase 2 trial in neoadjuvant TNBC designed to validate trilaciclib's immune-based mechanism of action ( MOA\u201d). These studies across treatment settings and tumor types will evaluate trilaciclib's dual benefits in both multi-lineage myeloprotection and anti-tumor efficacy. In addition, the MOA and ADC trials will inform the design of future additional pivotal studies across multiple tumor types and treatment combinations. The Company is also conducting significant preclinical work to assess the additive/synergistic potential of trilaciclib with a variety of novel and emerging therapeutic agents to identify synergies to evaluate in future clinical trials. G1's clinical approach to designing our clinical program includes monitoring the evolution of future standards of care and develop trilaciclib with these in mind, allowing us to conduct or support trials that will generate important data to maximize future usage in a variety of future settings.\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 281: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTrilaciclib Product Pipeline\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Candidate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Indication\n</td> <td> Current Status\n</td> <td> Timing of\nInitial Results\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Endpoints\n</td> <td> Development &\nCommercialization Rights\n(all indications)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> trilaciclib\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1L metastatic Colorectal cancer (CRC)\n</td> <td> Registrational trial (enrolling)\n</td> <td> 1Q 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Primary: myeloprotection\nSecondary: ORR, PFS/OS, PRO\n</td> <td>\nG1 Therapeutics owns all global development and commercial rights across all indications, with the exception of Greater China (Simcere)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1L metastatic Triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC)\n</td> <td> Registrational trial (enrolling)\n</td> <td> 2H 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Primary: OS\nSecondary: PRO, myeloprotection, PFS/ORR\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1L Bladder cancer (mUC)\n</td> <td> Phase 2 trial\n(enrolling)\n</td> <td> 4Q 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Primary: PFS\nSecondary: ORR*, OS, myeloprotection*, others\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) combination trial in mTNBC\n</td> <td> Phase 2 trial (enrolling)\n</td> <td> 4Q 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Primary: PFS\nSecondary: ORR*, OS, myeloprotection*, others\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Mechanism of action trial in early stage neoadjuvant TNBC\n</td> <td> Phase 2 trial (enrolling)\n</td> <td> 4Q 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Primary: Immune-based MOA*\nSecondary: pCR, immune response, others\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPFS=progression-free survival; OS=overall survival; PRO=patient reported outcome; ORR=overall response rate; pCR=pathological complete response; MOA=mechanism of action. *=initial results for Phase 2 trials expected in 4Q 2022\nLerociclib\nLerociclib is a differentiated oral CDK4/6 inhibitor being developed for use in combination with other targeted therapies in multiple oncology indications. In 2020, we entered into separate, exclusive agreements with EQRx, Inc. (rights for U.S., Europe, Japan and all markets outside Asia-Pacific) and Genor Biopharma Co. Inc. (rights for Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan) for the development and commercialization of lerociclib in all indications. Combined, these agreements provided $26.0 million in upfront payments, along with sales-based royalties, and the opportunity for up to $330.0 million in potential milestone payments. EQRx, Inc. and Genor Biopharma Co. Inc. are responsible for all costs related to the development and commercialization of lerociclib in their respective territories.\nRintodestrant\nRintodestrant is a clinical-stage oral SERD, for use as a monotherapy and in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors, initially Ibrance\u00ae (palbociclib), for the treatment of ER+, HER2- breast cancer. We are in the process of evaluating partnering options for rintodestrant.\nCDK2 Inhibitor\nIn 2020, we entered into a global license agreement with ARC Therapeutics, LLC for the development and commercialization of an internally discovered CDK2 inhibitor for all human and veterinary uses. ARC is currently granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing, license with the right to grant sublicenses to one of our solely owned patent families.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) impact on operations\nWe have implemented business continuity plans to address the COVID-19 pandemic and minimize disruptions to ongoing operations. Enrollment of patients in current and future clinical trials may be impacted by COVID-19. Although we have not had any significant supply chain delays or shortages as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to date, we have experienced delays in the delivery of our investigational product to certain investigative sites due to shortages of ancillary materials and the delay of governmental inspections. To date, we are on track to meet all of our previously announced clinical milestones. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues or increases in severity, we could experience disruptions to our clinical development timelines. If we experience delays in patient enrollment, we could incur increased clinical program expense if it is deemed necessary or advisable to improve patient recruitment by opening additional clinical sites. COVID-19 travel limitations and government-mandated work-from-home or shelter-in-place orders, may reduce the number of in-person meetings with prescribers and fewer patient visits with physicians, potentially resulting in fewer new prescriptions.\nWe established a COVID-19 response team which continually monitors the impact of COVID-19 on our operations. The COVID-19 response team manages our workplace protocols that govern our employees' use of our office. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business, we put in place the following safety measures for our employees, patients, healthcare professionals, and suppliers to limit exposure: we substantially restricted travel, supplied personal protective equipment to employees, limited access to our headquarters and asked most of our staff to work remotely. As of December 31, 2021, the majority of our employees are still working remotely, which may negatively impact our ability to conduct research and development activities, engage in sales-related initiatives, or efficiently conduct day-to-day operations. In addition, we added bandwidth and VPN capacity to our infrastructure to facilitate remote work arrangements. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, including how it will impact our employees, clinical trials, development programs, supply chain, and other aspects of our operations, and report to our Board of Directors regularly on the progress of our response to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nFinancial Overview\nSince our inception in 2008, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to synthesizing, acquiring, testing and developing our product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and providing selling, general and administrative support for these operations as well as securing intellectual property protection for our products. Currently, COSELA is our only product approved for sale. We began generating revenue for the net product sales from COSELA in March of 2021.We recorded $11.1 million of net product sales from COSELA and $20.4 million of license revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $45.3 million of license revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, our loan agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., and licensing arrangements. Under our licensing arrangements, we are eligible to receive certain development and sales-based milestones. Our ability to earn these milestones and the timing of achieving these milestones is primarily dependent upon the outcome of the licensee's activities and is uncertain at this time.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $221.2 million. Since inception, we have incurred net losses. Our net losses were $148.4 million, $99.3 million and $122.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $584.5 million. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs, our commercial launch of COSELA, and from selling, general and administrative expenses associated with our operations. We expect our research and development, commercial activities, and selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in connection with our ongoing and future activities as we:\nTable 282: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> continue development of trilaciclib, including initiation of additional clinical trials\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 283: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> identify and develop new product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 284: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> seek additional marketing approvals for trilaciclib upon successful completion of clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 285: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> grow our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize COSELA and any future products for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 286: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> achieve market acceptance of our products in the medical community and with third-party payors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 287: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 288: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> hire additional personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> enter into collaboration arrangements, if any, for the development of our products or in-license other products and technologies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 290: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> identify and develop new product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 291: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 292: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nOn February 12, 2021, COSELA was approved by the FDA and we began generating revenue for the product sales of COSELA in March 2021. Prior to the approval of COSELA, our revenues were derived solely from our license agreements.\nWe entered into an exclusive license agreement with Nanjing Simcere Dongyuan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd ( Simcere\u201d) in August 2020 and granted them the rights to develop and commercialize trilaciclib in Greater China (mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) (the Simcere Territory\u201d). We received an upfront payment of $14.0 million (less applicable withholding taxes of $1.4 million) in September 2020. This was recognized as revenue once the transfer of the license and related technology and know-how was completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. We have the potential to receive $156.0 million upon reaching development and commercial milestones, and receive tiered low double-digit royalties on annual net sales of trilaciclib in the Simcere Territory. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, three development milestones totaling $8.0 million (less applicable withholding taxes of $0.8 million) were received and recognized as revenue.\nWe entered into an exclusive license agreement with EQRx, Inc. ( EQRx\u201d) in July 2020 and granted them the rights to develop and commercialize lerociclib in the United States, Europe, Japan and all other global markets, excluding the Asia-Pacific region (except Japan) (the EQRx Territory\u201d). We received an upfront payment of $20.0 million in August 2020. This was recognized as revenue in September 2020 when we transferred the license and related technology and know-how. We have the potential to receive $290.0 million upon reaching development and commercial milestones, and receive tiered royalties ranging from mid-single digits to mid-teens based on annual net sales of lerociclib in the EQRx Territory.\nWe entered into an exclusive license agreement with Genor Biopharma Co. Inc. ( Genor\u201d) in June 2020 and granted them the rights to develop and commercialize lerociclib in the Asia-Pacific Region, excluding Japan (the Genor Territory\u201d). We received an upfront payment of $6.0 million in July 2020. This was recognized as revenue in September 2020 when we transferred the license and related technology and know-how. We have the potential to receive $40.0 million upon reaching development and commercial milestones, and receive tiered royalties ranging from high single to low double-digits based on annual net sales of lerociclib in the Genor Territory. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, one development milestone totaling $3.0 million was received and recognized as revenue.\nWe entered into an exclusive license agreement with ARC Therapeutics, LLC ( ARC\u201d) in May 2020. We granted ARC an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license of its CDK2 inhibitor compounds in exchange for an upfront payment and equity in ARC with a total value of approximately $2.1 million, which resulted in the recognition of related party revenue. We are entitled to receive additional milestone payments and sales-based royalties, and has right of first negotiation to re-acquire these assets.\nOperating expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into three categories: cost of goods sold, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense, comprise a significant component of each of these expense categories. We allocate expenses associated with personnel costs based on the nature of work associated with these resources.\nCost of goods sold\nCost of goods sold includes direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of COSELA, including third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight-in, third-party logistics costs associated with COSELA, and personnel costs. Cost of goods sold may also include period costs related to certain inventory manufacturing services and inventory adjustment charges.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe largest component of our total operating expenses since inception has been research and development activities, including the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Our research and development expense primarily consists of:\nTable 293: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> salaries and personnel-related costs, including bonuses, benefits and any stock-based compensation, for our scientific personnel performing or managing out-sourced research and development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 294: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs incurred under agreements with contract research organizations and investigative sites that conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 295: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs related to manufacturing pharmaceutical active ingredients and drug products for preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 296: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> costs related to upfront and milestone payments under in-licensing agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 297: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fees paid to consultants and other third parties who support our product development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 298: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> allocated facility-related costs and overhead.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe successful development of our products are highly uncertain. Products in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Accordingly, we expect research and development costs to increase as we conduct later stage clinical trials. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of products will depend on a variety of factors including:\nTable 299: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, rate of progress, and expenses of our ongoing as well as any additional clinical trials and other research and development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 300: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> future clinical trial results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 301: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> achievement of milestones requiring payments under our in-licensing agreements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 302: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rates or drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 303: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> potential additional studies requested by regulatory agencies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 304: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> significant and changing government regulation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 305: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe track research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis only for clinical-stage product candidates. Preclinical research and development expenses and chemical manufacturing research and development expenses are not assigned or allocated to individual development programs. In 2021, we had two clinical-stage products, trilaciclib and rintodestrant.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, allocated expenses and other expenses for outside professional services, including legal, audit and accounting services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees, pre-commercialization costs, expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents and costs of our information systems. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research and development and commercialization of COSELA.\nWe expect to continue to incur additional selling, general and administrative expenses in the future in connection with the commercialization of COSELA, as we support continued research and development activities, and as we support our operations in a public company environment, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq, additional insurance expenses, and expenses related to investor relations activities.\nTotal other income (expense), net\nTotal other income (expense), net consists of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and interest expenses incurred under our loan and security agreement with Hercules.\nIncome taxes\nTo date, we have not been required to pay U.S. federal or state income taxes because we have not generated taxable income. Income tax expense recognized in 2021 and 2020 related to the foreign withholding taxes incurred as a result of the Simcere license agreement.\nCritical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor elements of those arrangements that we determine should be accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d), we assess which activities in our license or collaboration agreements are performance obligations that should be accounted for separately and determine the transaction price of the arrangement, which includes the assessment of the probability of achievement of future milestones and other potential consideration. For arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, such as granting a license or performing manufacturing or research and development activities, we allocate the transaction price based on the relative standalone selling price and recognize revenue that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) control is transferred to the customer and the performance obligation is satisfied. Accordingly, we develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. These key assumptions may include revenue forecasts, clinical development timelines and costs, discount rates and probabilities of clinical and regulatory success.\nLicense Revenue\nLicenses of Intellectual Property\nIf a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue associated with the bundled performance obligation. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of progress and related revenue recognition.\nMilestone Payments\nAt the inception of each arrangement that includes developmental and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the achievement of each milestone specifically relates to our efforts to satisfy a performance obligation or transfer a distinct good or service within a performance obligation. We evaluates each milestone to determine when and how much of the milestone to include in the transaction price. We first estimates the amount of the milestone payment that we could receive using either the expected value or the most likely amount approach. We primarily uses the most likely amount approach as that approach is generally most predictive for milestone payments with a binary outcome. Then, we considers whether any portion of that estimated amount is subject to the variable consideration constraint (that is, whether it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur upon resolution of the uncertainty). We update the estimate of variable consideration included in the transaction price at each reporting date which includes updating the assessment of the likely amount of consideration and the application of the constraint to reflect current facts and circumstances.\nRoyalties\nFor arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we will recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any revenue related to sales-based royalties or milestone payments based on the level of sales.\nProduct Sales, Net\nWe sell COSELA to specialty distributors in the U.S. and, in accordance with ASC 606, recognizes revenue at the point in time when the customer is deemed to have obtained control of the product. The customer is deemed to have obtained control of the product at the time of physical receipt of the product at the customers' distribution facilities, or Free on Board ( FOB\u201d) destination, the terms of which are designated in the contract.\nProduct sales are recorded at the net selling price, which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established for (a) rebates and chargebacks, (b) co-pay assistance programs, (c) distribution fees, (d) product returns, and (e) other discounts. Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes which are probability-weighted for relevant factors such as current contractual and statutory requirements, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the applicable contract. The amount of variable consideration may be constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from estimates, we adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.\nLiabilities related to co-pay assistance, rebates, and GPO fees are classified as Accrued Expenses\u201d in the Condensed Balance Sheets. Discounts such as chargebacks, returns, and specialty distributor fees are recorded as a reduction to trade accounts receivable, which is included in Accounts Receivable\u201d in the Condensed Balance Sheets.\nForms of Variable Consideration\nRebates and Chargebacks: We estimate reductions to product sales for Public Health Service Institutions, such as Medicaid, Medicare and Veterans Administration ( VA\u201d) programs, as well as certain other qualifying federal and state government programs, and other group purchasing organizations. We estimate these reductions based upon our contracts with government agencies and other organizations, statutorily defined discounts and estimated payor mix. These organizations purchase directly from our specialty distributors at a discount and the specialty distributors charge us back the difference between the wholesaler price and the discounted price. Our liability for Medicaid rebates consists of estimates for claims that a state will make. We reserve for this discounted pricing is based on expected sales to qualified healthcare providers and the chargebacks that customers have already claimed.\nCo-pay assistance: Eligible patients who have commercial insurance may receive assistance from us to reduce the patient's out of pocket costs. Liabilities for co-pay assistance are calculated by actual program participation from third-party administrators.\nDistribution Fees: We have written contracts with its customers that include terms for distribution fees and costs for inventory management. We estimate and record distribution fees due to its customers based on gross sales.\nProduct Returns: We generally offers a right of return based on the product's expiration date and certain spoilage and damaged instances. We estimate the amount of product sales that may be returned and record the estimate as a reduction of product sales in the period the related product sales are recognized. Our estimates for expected returns are based primarily on an ongoing analysis of sales information and visibility into the inventory remaining in the distribution channel.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold includes direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of COSELA, including third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight-in, third-party logistics costs associated with COSELA, and our personnel costs. Cost of goods sold may also include period costs related to certain inventory manufacturing services and inventory adjustment charges. In connection with the FDA approval of COSELA on February 12, 2021, we subsequently began capitalizing inventory manufactured or purchased after this date. As a result, certain manufacturing costs associated with product shipments of COSELA were expensed prior to FDA approval and, therefore, are not included in cost of goods sold during the current period.\nAccrued research and development expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we estimate and accrue research and development expenses, including external clinical study costs associated with clinical trial activities. The process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders, identifying services that have been provided on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs.\nCosts for clinical trial activities are recognized based on an evaluation of our vendors' progress towards completion of specific tasks, using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors regarding their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of individual contracts and payment timing may differ significantly from the period in which the services were performed. We determine accrual estimates through reports from and discussions with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials, or the services completed. Our estimates of accrued external clinical study costs as of each balance sheet date are based on the facts and circumstances known at the time.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from the amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of the services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred.\nStock-based compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. Our stock-based compensation awards have historically consisted of stock options.\nWe recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. We account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating forfeitures as of the date of grant.\nWe recorded non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $22.3 million, $18.8 million and $16.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the expected volatility of our common stock, the assumed dividend yield, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options, and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. In applying these assumptions, we considered the following factors:\nTable 306: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common stock; we calculate expected volatility based on reported data for selected similar publicly traded companies for which the historical information is available as we do not have sufficient history to estimate volatility using only our common stock; in 2019, we began incorporating our historical stock price in conjunction with selected similar publicly traded companies; we plan to continue to use the guideline peer group volatility information until the historical volatility of our common stock is sufficient to measure expected volatility for future option grants;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 307: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the assumed dividend yield of zero is based on our expectation of not paying dividends for the foreseeable future;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 308: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our estimates of expected term used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were based on the estimated time from the grant date to the date of exercise;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 309: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> we determine the risk-free interest rate by reference to implied yields available from U.S. Treasury securities with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> we account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating forfeitures as of an award's grant date.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 10 - Stock-Based Compensation\u201d to the accompanying audited financial statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for the weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for awards granted in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nPrior to our initial public offering, the fair value of our common shares underlying our stock options was estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. In order to determine the fair value of our common shares underlying granted stock options, our board of directors considered, among other things, timely valuations of our common shares prepared by an unrelated third-party valuation firm in accordance with the guidance provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.\nGiven the absence of a public trading market for our common shares, our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered a number of objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common shares, including (1) our business, financial condition and results of operations, including related industry trends affecting our operations; (2) our forecasted operating performance and projected future cash flows; (3) the illiquid nature of our common shares; (4) liquidation preferences and other rights and privileges of our common shares; (5) market multiples of our most comparable public peers and (6) market conditions affecting our industry. Since our IPO, our board of directors has determined the fair value of each common share underlying share-based awards based on the closing price of our common shares as reported by the Nasdaq on the date of grant.\nIncome taxes\nWe recognize deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. We periodically evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Based upon the weight of the available evidence, which includes historical operating performance, reported cumulative net losses since inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results, we maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets for all periods presented. We intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets for the foreseeable future until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance.\nAt December 31, 2021, we have federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs\u201d) of approximately $510.0 million, which are available to offset future taxable income. Of the $510.0 million available, $95.4 million will begin to expire in 2029. The remaining $414.6 million has an indefinite carryforward period. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act\u201d), federal NOLs arising after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely. However, for NOLs arising after December 31, 2017, NOL carryforwards will be limited to 80% of taxable income. Our NOLs generated in 2017 and in prior years will not be subject to the 80% limitation under the Tax Act. In addition, we had state net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $332.7 million, which are available to offset future state taxable income. The state net operating loss carryforwards are inclusive of North Carolina net operating losses, which are recorded at zero benefit, as discussed in the income tax footnote. State net operating losses begin to expire in 2024. Because we had incurred cumulative net operating losses since inception, all tax years remain open to examination by U.S. federal and state income tax authorities. As of December 31, 2021, we also had federal research and development (R&D) credit carryforwards of approximately $17.0 million available to offset future income tax which begin to expire in 2035.\nOur ability to utilize net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards may be substantially limited due to ownership changes that may have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), as well as similar state provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of NOL and R&D credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change,\u201d as defined by Section 382 of the Code, results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percent of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups.\nIn April 2019, we completed an evaluation study as to whether an ownership change\u201d had occurred and determined that the limitation would be approximately $8.0 million on federal net operating loss carryforwards, $1.2 million on state net operating loss carryforwards, and $0.1 million on R&D tax credit carryforwards. The carryforward amounts reported above have already been reduced for these limitations. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance on the remaining NOLs and tax credits as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset associated with them will not be realized regardless of whether an ownership change\u201d has occurred.\nResults of operations\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020\nTable 311: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product sales, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,929\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,809\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 173,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 141,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (142,457\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (96,476\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45,981\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (909\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,667\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,778\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,889\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (346\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (542\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,970\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,368\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,602\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (147,427\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (97,844\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49,583\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (485\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (148,352\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (99,254\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (49,098\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct sales, net\nProduct sales, net was $11.1 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The sales revenue recognized in the current year was related to the product sales of COSELA. We received FDA approval of COSELA on February 12, 2021 and the product has been commercially available since March 2, 2021.\nLicense revenue\nLicense revenue was $20.4 million and $45.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. License revenue recognized in the current year was primarily related to $11.0 million in milestone payments from Genor and Simcere. We also recognized $2.5 million and $1.0 million in clinical trial costs reimbursed by EQRx and Simcere, respectively. Additionally, we recognized $5.9 million in supply, manufacturing services and patent reimbursable costs from EQRx, Genor, and Simcere. License revenue recognized in the prior year was primarily related to $42.1 million in revenue recognized from the Simcere, EQRx, Genor and ARC upfront payments under the respective license agreements following the transfer of related technology and know-how which occurred during the period. We also recognized $1.3 million for clinical trial costs reimbursed by EQRx and $0.4 million in patent costs to be reimbursed by EQRx, Genor, and Simcere. Additionally, we recognized $1.3 million in revenue for existing inventory transfers to EQRx and Genor which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nCost of goods sold\nCost of goods sold was $2.0 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Cost of goods sold includes our third-party logistics costs for the sales of COSELA, inventory overhead costs, and personnel costs.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses were $76.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $73.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $2.9 million, or 4%, was primarily due to an increase of $20.0 million in our clinical program costs, offset by a decrease of $16.2 million for manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product to support our clinical trials and a decrease of $0.9 million in external costs related to discovery and preclinical development. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses allocated to trilaciclib, rintodestrant, lerociclib, and unallocated research and development expenses for the periods indicated:\nTable 312: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical expenses-trilaciclib\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical expenses-rintodestrant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical expenses-lerociclib\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Chemical manufacturing and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discovery and pre-clinical expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 73,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $95.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $27.2 million, or 40%, was due to an increase of $12.7 million in personnel related costs due to increased headcount, of which $5.4 million related to non-cash stock compensation expense, an increase of $12.1 million in commercialization activities, an increase of $2.2 in information technology systems and related expenses, and an increase of $0.2 million medical affairs costs related to trilaciclib, professional services, insurance, and other administrative costs.\nTotal other income (expense), net\nTotal other income (expense), net was $(5.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $(1.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The decrease of $15.7 million, or -18%, was primarily due to a decrease of $10.2 million in our clinical program costs due to a decrease in spend for ongoing clinical trials of $5.7 million and decrease of $5.9 million related to a regulatory filing expense of $2.9 million incurred in 2019 and reimbursed in 2020, partially offset by an increase in personnel costs of $1.4 million. The decrease of $1.3 million in costs for manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product to support our clinical trials, as well as a decrease in research and development expenses was also due to a decrease of $4.2 million in external costs related to discovery and preclinical development. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses allocated to trilaciclib, rintodestrant, lerociclib, and unallocated research and development expenses for the periods indicated:\nTable 314: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical expenses-trilaciclib\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical expenses-rintodestrant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical expenses-lerociclib\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Chemical manufacturing and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discovery and pre-clinical expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 73,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $40.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $28.5 million, or 71%, was due to an increase of $6.8 million in personnel related costs due to increased headcount, of which $1.7 million related to non-cash stock compensation expense, an increase of $15.8 million in expenses related to pre-commercialization activities, an increase of $2.0 million in medical affairs costs related to trilaciclib, an increase of $0.8 million in information technology systems and related expenses, and an increase of $3.1 million professional services, insurance, and other administrative costs.\nTotal other income (expense), net\nTotal other income (expense), net was $(1.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $8.0 million was primarily driven by a lower balance of money market funds due to cash used in operating activities and changes in interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expense on loan payable, and loss on disposal of fixed assets.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense was $1.4 million and $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The income tax expense recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the foreign withholding taxes incurred as a result of the upfront payment received from the Simcere license agreement entered into in 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred cumulative losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception in 2008. We incurred net losses of $148.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, $99.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $122.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $584.5 million.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $221.2 million. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through proceeds from our initial public offering, our follow-on stock offerings, our debt agreement with Hercules Capital, and proceeds from our license agreements. Under our licensing arrangements, we are eligible to receive certain development and sales-based milestones. Our ability to earn these milestones and the timing of achieving these milestones is primarily dependent upon the outcome of the licensee's activities and are uncertain at this time.\nShelf registration statement\nOn July 2, 2021, we filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d), which we refer to as the 2021 Form S-3. Each issuance under the shelf registration statement would have required the filing of a prospectus supplement identifying the amount and terms of securities to be issued. The 2021 Form S-3 did not limit the amount of securities that could have been issued thereunder.\nOn February 23, 2022, because we are no longer a well-known seasoned issuer\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, we filed an automatic post-effective amendment to the 2021 Form S-3 on Form POSASR, which became effective upon filing, to register for sale up to $300.0 million of any combination of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine and, as required by SEC rules, will file another post-effective amendment to the 2021 Form S-3 on Form POS AM after the filing of this Form 10-K. Once the post-effective amendment to the 2021 Form S-3 on Form POS AM has been declared effective by the SEC, the 2021 Form S-3 will remain in effect for up to three years from the date it originally became effective, which was July 2, 2021. We make no assurances as to our ability to continue to use the 2021 Form S-3.\nAt-the-market offerings\nOn June 15, 2018, we entered into a sales agreement for at the market offerings\u201d with Cowen and Company, LLC ( Cowen\u201d), which allows us to issue and sell shares of common stock pursuant to a shelf registration statement for total gross sales proceeds of up to $125.0 million from time to time through Cowen, acting as our agent. Between June 18, 2018 and August 2, 2018, we sold 752,008 shares of common stock pursuant to this agreement resulting in $36.1 million in net proceeds, realizing $12.1 million in the second quarter and the remaining $24.0 million by August 2, 2018.\nBetween January 14, 2021 and February 9, 2021, we sold 3,513,027 shares of common stock pursuant to this agreement resulting in $86.4 million in net proceeds. As of February 9, 2021, we have used the entirety of the remaining availability under the sales agreement with Cowen.\nIn connection with the 2021 Form S-3, on July 2, 2021, we entered into a sales agreement for at the market offerings\u201d with Cowen, which allowed us to issue and sell shares of common stock pursuant to the 2021 Form S-3 for total gross sales proceeds of up to $150.0 million from time to time through Cowen, acting as our agent (the 2021 Sales Agreement\u201d). We did not sell any shares of common stock or other securities under the 2021 Sales Agreement and we terminated the 2021 Sales Agreement on February 23, 2022. Also, on February 23, 2022, we entered into the 2022 Sales Agreement for at the market offerings\u201d with Cowen, which allows us to issue and sell shares of common stock pursuant to the 2021 Form S-3, once it has been post-effectively amended as noted above, for total gross sales proceeds of up to $100.0 million from time to time through Cowen, acting as our agent.\nLoan and Security Agreement with Hercules\nOn May 29, 2020, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. ( Hercules\u201d) under which Hercules has agreed to lend us up to $100.0 million, to be made available in a series of tranches, subject to specified conditions. We borrowed $20.0 million at loan closing. The term of the loan is approximately 48 months, with a maturity date of June 1, 2024. No principal payments are due during an interest-only period, commencing on the initial borrowing date and continuing through June 1, 2022. The interest only period may be extended through January 1, 2023 upon satisfaction of certain milestones. Following the interest only period, we will repay the principal balance and interest of the advances in equal monthly installments through June 1, 2024.\nOn March 31, 2021, we entered into the First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the First Amendment\u201d) with Hercules whereby the Company drew the remaining $10.0 million of the first tranche and the interest rate and financial covenants were amended. Unless loan advances exceeded $40.0 million, no financial covenants were required.\nOn November 1, 2021, we entered into a Second Amendment to the loan and security agreement with Hercules under which Hercules has agreed to lend us up to $150.0 million, to be made available in a series of tranches, subject to certain terms and conditions. The first tranche was increased to $100.0 million. At close of the Second Amendment, we borrowed an additional $45.0 million from Tranche 1 with $25.0 million remaining to be borrowed through September 15, 2022. No principal payments are due during an interest-only period, commencing on the close of the Second Amendment and continuing through December 1, 2024. The interest only period may be extended through December 1, 2025, in quarterly increments, subject to compliance with covenants of the Second Amendment. Following the interest only period, we will repay the principal balance and interest of the advances in equal monthly installments through the maturity date of November 1, 2026.\nCash flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 315: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (132,108\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (83,742\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (99,571\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided/used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,716\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 145,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (61,902\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (99,582\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in operating activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $132.1 million, which consisted of a net loss of $148.4 million and a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million, partially offset by an increase in non-cash equity interest of $0.4 million, non-cash stock compensation expense of $22.3 million, $0.5 million of depreciation expense, $1.1 million in amortization of debt issuance costs, $0.6 million of non-cash interest expense, and $0.2 million from loss on extinguishment of debt.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $83.7 million, which consisted of a net loss of $99.3 million, a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $4.0 million, and a decrease in non-cash equity interest of $0.9 million, partially offset by non-cash stock compensation expense of $18.8 million, $0.6 million of depreciation expense, $0.6 million in amortization of debt issuance costs, $0.3 million loss on disposal of fixed assets, and $0.2 million of non-cash interest expense.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $99.6 million, which consisted of a net loss of $122.4 million, partially offset by non-cash stock compensation expense of $16.4 million, working capital adjustments of $6.0 million and $0.4 million of depreciation expense.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 there was no cash provided or used in investing activities.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which represented proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which represented purchases of property and equipment, primarily associated with laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements for new office space.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $145.9 million, which consisted of $86.4 million in net proceeds from our ATM offering after deducting cash paid during the year for underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses, $55.0 million in proceeds from our loan agreement with Hercules, partially offset by $1.4 million in payments related to debt issuances costs, and $5.9 million in net proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $21.7 million, which consisted of $2.3 million in net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and $20.0 million in proceed from our loan agreement with Hercules, partially offset by $0.6 million in payments related to debt issuances costs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $2.7 million in net proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nOperating capital requirements and plan of operations\nTo date, we have generated limited revenue from product sales. We expect our expenses to increase as we continue the development of and seek additional regulatory approvals for trilaciclib, and continue to commercialize COSELA. We are subject to all of the risks inherent in the development of new products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our projected cash needs for greater than 12 months following the filing of this Annual Report.\nWe have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all of our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\nTable 316: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, progress, results and costs of nonclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 317: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the scope, prioritization and number of our research and development programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 318: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 319: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the extent to which we enter into non-exclusive, jointly funded clinical research collaboration arrangements, if any, for the development of our product candidates in combination with other companies' products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 320: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our ability to establish such collaborative co-development arrangements on favorable terms, if at all;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 321: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under our license agreement and any collaboration agreements into which we enter;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 322: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the extent to which we are obligated to reimburse, or entitled to reimbursement of, clinical trial costs under future collaboration agreements, if any;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 323: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the extent to which we acquire or in-license product candidates and technologies, such as rintodestrant, and the terms of such in-licenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 324: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 325: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> revenue received from commercial sales of our product candidates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 326: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds except for amounts included under our licensing arrangements and the loan agreement with Hercules. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders' ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our clinical trial commitments, consulting fees, operating lease commitments and long-term debt obligations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of patients with cancer. Our first product approved by the FDA, COSELA\u2122 (trilaciclib), is the first and only therapy indicated to proactively help protect bone marrow from the damage of chemotherapy and is the first innovation in managing myeloprotection in decades.\nWe shall use COSELA\u201d when referring to our FDA approved drug and trilaciclib\u201d when referring to our development of COSELA for additional indications.\nCOSELA is a prescription medicine used to help reduce the occurrence of low blood cell counts caused by damage to bone marrow from chemotherapy. COSELA is used to treat adults taking certain chemotherapies (platinum/etoposide or topotecan) for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.\nCOSELA is an injection for intravenous (IV) use given within 4 hours before chemotherapy.\nCommercial Product\nOn February 12, 2021, COSELA (trilaciclib) for injection was approved by the FDA to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in adult patients treated with a platinum/etoposide-containing regimen or topotecan-containing regimen for ES-SCLC. We are also exploring potential use of trilaciclib in a variety of tumors, including colorectal cancer ( CRC\u201d), breast cancer, bladder cancer, and in trials designed to inform the design of future additional pivotal studies across multiple tumor types and treatment combinations including targeted chemotherapy medicines called antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).\nIn June 2020, we entered into a three-year co-promotion agreement for COSELA in the United States and Puerto Rico with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In December 2021, G1 and Boehringer Ingelheim mutually agreed to end the co-promotion agreement for COSELA, effective March 2022. At that time, the Company announced that it would hire and deploy a total of 34 oncology sales representatives to allow G1 to target all accounts to accelerate sales activities and help maximize the adoption of COSELA. As of February 21, 2022, all 34 sales representatives have been hired, trained, and deployed.\nProduct Pipeline\nTrilaciclib is a first-in-class therapy designed to help protect against chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression.\nWe are executing on our tumor-agnostic strategy to evaluate the potential benefits of trilaciclib to patients with other tumors to continuously develop new data with trilaciclib in a variety of chemotherapeutic settings and in combination with other agents to maximize the applicability of the drug to potential future treatment paradigms. We currently have five on-going clinical trials: a pivotal trial in 1L colorectal cancer ( CRC\u201d), a pivotal trial in 1L mTNBC, a Phase 2 1L bladder cancer trial with chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor, a Phase 2 trial designed to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and myeloprotective benefit of trilaciclib administered prior to an antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC\u201d), and a Phase 2 trial in neoadjuvant TNBC designed to validate trilaciclib's immune-based mechanism of action ( MOA\u201d). These studies across treatment settings and tumor types will evaluate trilaciclib's dual benefits in both multi-lineage myeloprotection and anti-tumor efficacy. In addition, the MOA and ADC trials will inform the design of future additional pivotal studies across multiple tumor types and treatment combinations. The Company is also conducting significant preclinical work to assess the additive/synergistic potential of trilaciclib with a variety of novel and emerging therapeutic agents to identify synergies to evaluate in future clinical trials. G1's clinical approach to designing our clinical program includes monitoring the evolution of future standards of care and develop trilaciclib with these in mind, allowing us to conduct or support trials that will generate important data to maximize future usage in a variety of future settings.\n \nTable 281: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTrilaciclib Product Pipeline\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Candidate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Indication\n</td> <td> Current Status\n</td> <td> Timing of\nInitial Results\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Endpoints\n</td> <td> Development &\nCommercialization Rights\n(all indications)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> trilaciclib\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1L metastatic Colorectal cancer (CRC)\n</td> <td> Registrational trial (enrolling)\n</td> <td> 1Q 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Primary: myeloprotection\nSecondary: ORR, PFS/OS, PRO\n</td> <td>\nG1 Therapeutics owns all global development and commercial rights across all indications, with the exception of Greater China (Simcere)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1L metastatic Triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC)\n</td> <td> Registrational trial (enrolling)\n</td> <td> 2H 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Primary: OS\nSecondary: PRO, myeloprotection, PFS/ORR\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1L Bladder cancer (mUC)\n</td> <td> Phase 2 trial\n(enrolling)\n</td> <td> 4Q 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Primary: PFS\nSecondary: ORR*, OS, myeloprotection*, others\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) combination trial in mTNBC\n</td> <td> Phase 2 trial (enrolling)\n</td> <td> 4Q 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Primary: PFS\nSecondary: ORR*, OS, myeloprotection*, others\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Mechanism of action trial in early stage neoadjuvant TNBC\n</td> <td> Phase 2 trial (enrolling)\n</td> <td> 4Q 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Primary: Immune-based MOA*\nSecondary: pCR, immune response, others\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPFS=progression-free survival; OS=overall survival; PRO=patient reported outcome; ORR=overall response rate; pCR=pathological complete response; MOA=mechanism of action. *=initial results for Phase 2 trials expected in 4Q 2022\nLerociclib\nLerociclib is a differentiated oral CDK4/6 inhibitor being developed for use in combination with other targeted therapies in multiple oncology indications. In 2020, we entered into separate, exclusive agreements with EQRx, Inc. (rights for U.S., Europe, Japan and all markets outside Asia-Pacific) and Genor Biopharma Co. Inc. (rights for Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan) for the development and commercialization of lerociclib in all indications. Combined, these agreements provided $26.0 million in upfront payments, along with sales-based royalties, and the opportunity for up to $330.0 million in potential milestone payments. EQRx, Inc. and Genor Biopharma Co. Inc. are responsible for all costs related to the development and commercialization of lerociclib in their respective territories.\nRintodestrant\nRintodestrant is a clinical-stage oral SERD, for use as a monotherapy and in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors, initially Ibrance\u00ae (palbociclib), for the treatment of ER+, HER2- breast cancer. We are in the process of evaluating partnering options for rintodestrant.\nCDK2 Inhibitor\nIn 2020, we entered into a global license agreement with ARC Therapeutics, LLC for the development and commercialization of an internally discovered CDK2 inhibitor for all human and veterinary uses. ARC is currently granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing, license with the right to grant sublicenses to one of our solely owned patent families.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) impact on operations\nWe have implemented business continuity plans to address the COVID-19 pandemic and minimize disruptions to ongoing operations. Enrollment of patients in current and future clinical trials may be impacted by COVID-19. Although we have not had any significant supply chain delays or shortages as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to date, we have experienced delays in the delivery of our investigational product to certain investigative sites due to shortages of ancillary materials and the delay of governmental inspections. To date, we are on track to meet all of our previously announced clinical milestones. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues or increases in severity, we could experience disruptions to our clinical development timelines. If we experience delays in patient enrollment, we could incur increased clinical program expense if it is deemed necessary or advisable to improve patient recruitment by opening additional clinical sites. COVID-19 travel limitations and government-mandated work-from-home or shelter-in-place orders, may reduce the number of in-person meetings with prescribers and fewer patient visits with physicians, potentially resulting in fewer new prescriptions.\nWe established a COVID-19 response team which continually monitors the impact of COVID-19 on our operations. The COVID-19 response team manages our workplace protocols that govern our employees' use of our office. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business, we put in place the following safety measures for our employees, patients, healthcare professionals, and suppliers to limit exposure: we substantially restricted travel, supplied personal protective equipment to employees, limited access to our headquarters and asked most of our staff to work remotely. As of December 31, 2021, the majority of our employees are still working remotely, which may negatively impact our ability to conduct research and development activities, engage in sales-related initiatives, or efficiently conduct day-to-day operations. In addition, we added bandwidth and VPN capacity to our infrastructure to facilitate remote work arrangements. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, including how it will impact our employees, clinical trials, development programs, supply chain, and other aspects of our operations, and report to our Board of Directors regularly on the progress of our response to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nFinancial Overview\nSince our inception in 2008, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to synthesizing, acquiring, testing and developing our product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and providing selling, general and administrative support for these operations as well as securing intellectual property protection for our products. Currently, COSELA is our only product approved for sale. We began generating revenue for the net product sales from COSELA in March of 2021.We recorded $11.1 million of net product sales from COSELA and $20.4 million of license revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $45.3 million of license revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, our loan agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., and licensing arrangements. Under our licensing arrangements, we are eligible to receive certain development and sales-based milestones. Our ability to earn these milestones and the timing of achieving these milestones is primarily dependent upon the outcome of the licensee's activities and is uncertain at this time.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $221.2 million. Since inception, we have incurred net losses. Our net losses were $148.4 million, $99.3 million and $122.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $584.5 million. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs, our commercial launch of COSELA, and from selling, general and administrative expenses associated with our operations. We expect our research and development, commercial activities, and selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in connection with our ongoing and future activities as we:\n \u2022 continue development of trilaciclib, including initiation of additional clinical trials \n \u2022 identify and develop new product candidates; \n \u2022 seek additional marketing approvals for trilaciclib upon successful completion of clinical trials; \n \u2022 grow our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize COSELA and any future products for which we may obtain marketing approval; \n \u2022 achieve market acceptance of our products in the medical community and with third-party payors; \n \u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u2022 hire additional personnel; \n \u2022 enter into collaboration arrangements, if any, for the development of our products or in-license other products and technologies; \n \u2022 identify and develop new product candidates; \n \u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and \n \u2022 continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company. \nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nOn February 12, 2021, COSELA was approved by the FDA and we began generating revenue for the product sales of COSELA in March 2021. Prior to the approval of COSELA, our revenues were derived solely from our license agreements.\nWe entered into an exclusive license agreement with Nanjing Simcere Dongyuan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd ( Simcere\u201d) in August 2020 and granted them the rights to develop and commercialize trilaciclib in Greater China (mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) (the Simcere Territory\u201d). We received an upfront payment of $14.0 million (less applicable withholding taxes of $1.4 million) in September 2020. This was recognized as revenue once the transfer of the license and related technology and know-how was completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. We have the potential to receive $156.0 million upon reaching development and commercial milestones, and receive tiered low double-digit royalties on annual net sales of trilaciclib in the Simcere Territory. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, three development milestones totaling $8.0 million (less applicable withholding taxes of $0.8 million) were received and recognized as revenue.\nWe entered into an exclusive license agreement with EQRx, Inc. ( EQRx\u201d) in July 2020 and granted them the rights to develop and commercialize lerociclib in the United States, Europe, Japan and all other global markets, excluding the Asia-Pacific region (except Japan) (the EQRx Territory\u201d). We received an upfront payment of $20.0 million in August 2020. This was recognized as revenue in September 2020 when we transferred the license and related technology and know-how. We have the potential to receive $290.0 million upon reaching development and commercial milestones, and receive tiered royalties ranging from mid-single digits to mid-teens based on annual net sales of lerociclib in the EQRx Territory.\nWe entered into an exclusive license agreement with Genor Biopharma Co. Inc. ( Genor\u201d) in June 2020 and granted them the rights to develop and commercialize lerociclib in the Asia-Pacific Region, excluding Japan (the Genor Territory\u201d). We received an upfront payment of $6.0 million in July 2020. This was recognized as revenue in September 2020 when we transferred the license and related technology and know-how. We have the potential to receive $40.0 million upon reaching development and commercial milestones, and receive tiered royalties ranging from high single to low double-digits based on annual net sales of lerociclib in the Genor Territory. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, one development milestone totaling $3.0 million was received and recognized as revenue.\nWe entered into an exclusive license agreement with ARC Therapeutics, LLC ( ARC\u201d) in May 2020. We granted ARC an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license of its CDK2 inhibitor compounds in exchange for an upfront payment and equity in ARC with a total value of approximately $2.1 million, which resulted in the recognition of related party revenue. We are entitled to receive additional milestone payments and sales-based royalties, and has right of first negotiation to re-acquire these assets.\nOperating expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into three categories: cost of goods sold, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense, comprise a significant component of each of these expense categories. We allocate expenses associated with personnel costs based on the nature of work associated with these resources.\nCost of goods sold\nCost of goods sold includes direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of COSELA, including third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight-in, third-party logistics costs associated with COSELA, and personnel costs. Cost of goods sold may also include period costs related to certain inventory manufacturing services and inventory adjustment charges.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe largest component of our total operating expenses since inception has been research and development activities, including the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Our research and development expense primarily consists of:\n \u2022 salaries and personnel-related costs, including bonuses, benefits and any stock-based compensation, for our scientific personnel performing or managing out-sourced research and development activities; \n \u2022 costs incurred under agreements with contract research organizations and investigative sites that conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials; \n \u2022 costs related to manufacturing pharmaceutical active ingredients and drug products for preclinical studies and clinical trials; \n \u2022 costs related to upfront and milestone payments under in-licensing agreements; \n \u2022 fees paid to consultants and other third parties who support our product development; \n \u2022 allocated facility-related costs and overhead. \nThe successful development of our products are highly uncertain. Products in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Accordingly, we expect research and development costs to increase as we conduct later stage clinical trials. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of products will depend on a variety of factors including:\n \u2022 the scope, rate of progress, and expenses of our ongoing as well as any additional clinical trials and other research and development activities; \n \u2022 future clinical trial results; \n \u2022 achievement of milestones requiring payments under our in-licensing agreements; \n \u2022 uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rates or drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; \n \u2022 potential additional studies requested by regulatory agencies; \n \u2022 significant and changing government regulation; and \n \u2022 the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals. \nWe track research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis only for clinical-stage product candidates. Preclinical research and development expenses and chemical manufacturing research and development expenses are not assigned or allocated to individual development programs. In 2021, we had two clinical-stage products, trilaciclib and rintodestrant.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, allocated expenses and other expenses for outside professional services, including legal, audit and accounting services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees, pre-commercialization costs, expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents and costs of our information systems. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research and development and commercialization of COSELA.\nWe expect to continue to incur additional selling, general and administrative expenses in the future in connection with the commercialization of COSELA, as we support continued research and development activities, and as we support our operations in a public company environment, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq, additional insurance expenses, and expenses related to investor relations activities.\nTotal other income (expense), net\nTotal other income (expense), net consists of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and interest expenses incurred under our loan and security agreement with Hercules.\nIncome taxes\nTo date, we have not been required to pay U.S. federal or state income taxes because we have not generated taxable income. Income tax expense recognized in 2021 and 2020 related to the foreign withholding taxes incurred as a result of the Simcere license agreement.\nCritical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor elements of those arrangements that we determine should be accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d), we assess which activities in our license or collaboration agreements are performance obligations that should be accounted for separately and determine the transaction price of the arrangement, which includes the assessment of the probability of achievement of future milestones and other potential consideration. For arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, such as granting a license or performing manufacturing or research and development activities, we allocate the transaction price based on the relative standalone selling price and recognize revenue that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) control is transferred to the customer and the performance obligation is satisfied. Accordingly, we develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. These key assumptions may include revenue forecasts, clinical development timelines and costs, discount rates and probabilities of clinical and regulatory success.\nLicense Revenue\nLicenses of Intellectual Property\nIf a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue associated with the bundled performance obligation. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of progress and related revenue recognition.\nMilestone Payments\nAt the inception of each arrangement that includes developmental and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the achievement of each milestone specifically relates to our efforts to satisfy a performance obligation or transfer a distinct good or service within a performance obligation. We evaluates each milestone to determine when and how much of the milestone to include in the transaction price. We first estimates the amount of the milestone payment that we could receive using either the expected value or the most likely amount approach. We primarily uses the most likely amount approach as that approach is generally most predictive for milestone payments with a binary outcome. Then, we considers whether any portion of that estimated amount is subject to the variable consideration constraint (that is, whether it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur upon resolution of the uncertainty). We update the estimate of variable consideration included in the transaction price at each reporting date which includes updating the assessment of the likely amount of consideration and the application of the constraint to reflect current facts and circumstances.\nRoyalties\nFor arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we will recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any revenue related to sales-based royalties or milestone payments based on the level of sales.\nProduct Sales, Net\nWe sell COSELA to specialty distributors in the U.S. and, in accordance with ASC 606, recognizes revenue at the point in time when the customer is deemed to have obtained control of the product. The customer is deemed to have obtained control of the product at the time of physical receipt of the product at the customers' distribution facilities, or Free on Board ( FOB\u201d) destination, the terms of which are designated in the contract.\nProduct sales are recorded at the net selling price, which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established for (a) rebates and chargebacks, (b) co-pay assistance programs, (c) distribution fees, (d) product returns, and (e) other discounts. Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes which are probability-weighted for relevant factors such as current contractual and statutory requirements, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the applicable contract. The amount of variable consideration may be constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from estimates, we adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.\nLiabilities related to co-pay assistance, rebates, and GPO fees are classified as Accrued Expenses\u201d in the Condensed Balance Sheets. Discounts such as chargebacks, returns, and specialty distributor fees are recorded as a reduction to trade accounts receivable, which is included in Accounts Receivable\u201d in the Condensed Balance Sheets.\nForms of Variable Consideration\nRebates and Chargebacks: We estimate reductions to product sales for Public Health Service Institutions, such as Medicaid, Medicare and Veterans Administration ( VA\u201d) programs, as well as certain other qualifying federal and state government programs, and other group purchasing organizations. We estimate these reductions based upon our contracts with government agencies and other organizations, statutorily defined discounts and estimated payor mix. These organizations purchase directly from our specialty distributors at a discount and the specialty distributors charge us back the difference between the wholesaler price and the discounted price. Our liability for Medicaid rebates consists of estimates for claims that a state will make. We reserve for this discounted pricing is based on expected sales to qualified healthcare providers and the chargebacks that customers have already claimed.\nCo-pay assistance: Eligible patients who have commercial insurance may receive assistance from us to reduce the patient's out of pocket costs. Liabilities for co-pay assistance are calculated by actual program participation from third-party administrators.\nDistribution Fees: We have written contracts with its customers that include terms for distribution fees and costs for inventory management. We estimate and record distribution fees due to its customers based on gross sales.\nProduct Returns: We generally offers a right of return based on the product's expiration date and certain spoilage and damaged instances. We estimate the amount of product sales that may be returned and record the estimate as a reduction of product sales in the period the related product sales are recognized. Our estimates for expected returns are based primarily on an ongoing analysis of sales information and visibility into the inventory remaining in the distribution channel.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold includes direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of COSELA, including third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight-in, third-party logistics costs associated with COSELA, and our personnel costs. Cost of goods sold may also include period costs related to certain inventory manufacturing services and inventory adjustment charges. In connection with the FDA approval of COSELA on February 12, 2021, we subsequently began capitalizing inventory manufactured or purchased after this date. As a result, certain manufacturing costs associated with product shipments of COSELA were expensed prior to FDA approval and, therefore, are not included in cost of goods sold during the current period.\nAccrued research and development expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we estimate and accrue research and development expenses, including external clinical study costs associated with clinical trial activities. The process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders, identifying services that have been provided on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs.\nCosts for clinical trial activities are recognized based on an evaluation of our vendors' progress towards completion of specific tasks, using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors regarding their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of individual contracts and payment timing may differ significantly from the period in which the services were performed. We determine accrual estimates through reports from and discussions with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials, or the services completed. Our estimates of accrued external clinical study costs as of each balance sheet date are based on the facts and circumstances known at the time.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from the amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of the services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred.\nStock-based compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. Our stock-based compensation awards have historically consisted of stock options.\nWe recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. We account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating forfeitures as of the date of grant.\nWe recorded non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $22.3 million, $18.8 million and $16.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the expected volatility of our common stock, the assumed dividend yield, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options, and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. In applying these assumptions, we considered the following factors:\n \u2022 we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common stock; we calculate expected volatility based on reported data for selected similar publicly traded companies for which the historical information is available as we do not have sufficient history to estimate volatility using only our common stock; in 2019, we began incorporating our historical stock price in conjunction with selected similar publicly traded companies; we plan to continue to use the guideline peer group volatility information until the historical volatility of our common stock is sufficient to measure expected volatility for future option grants; \n \u2022 the assumed dividend yield of zero is based on our expectation of not paying dividends for the foreseeable future; \n \u2022 our estimates of expected term used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were based on the estimated time from the grant date to the date of exercise; \n \u2022 we determine the risk-free interest rate by reference to implied yields available from U.S. Treasury securities with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant; and \n \u2022 we account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating forfeitures as of an award's grant date. \nSee Note 10 - Stock-Based Compensation\u201d to the accompanying audited financial statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for the weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for awards granted in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nPrior to our initial public offering, the fair value of our common shares underlying our stock options was estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. In order to determine the fair value of our common shares underlying granted stock options, our board of directors considered, among other things, timely valuations of our common shares prepared by an unrelated third-party valuation firm in accordance with the guidance provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.\nGiven the absence of a public trading market for our common shares, our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered a number of objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common shares, including (1) our business, financial condition and results of operations, including related industry trends affecting our operations; (2) our forecasted operating performance and projected future cash flows; (3) the illiquid nature of our common shares; (4) liquidation preferences and other rights and privileges of our common shares; (5) market multiples of our most comparable public peers and (6) market conditions affecting our industry. Since our IPO, our board of directors has determined the fair value of each common share underlying share-based awards based on the closing price of our common shares as reported by the Nasdaq on the date of grant.\nIncome taxes\nWe recognize deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. We periodically evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Based upon the weight of the available evidence, which includes historical operating performance, reported cumulative net losses since inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results, we maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets for all periods presented. We intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets for the foreseeable future until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance.\nAt December 31, 2021, we have federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs\u201d) of approximately $510.0 million, which are available to offset future taxable income. Of the $510.0 million available, $95.4 million will begin to expire in 2029. The remaining $414.6 million has an indefinite carryforward period. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act\u201d), federal NOLs arising after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely. However, for NOLs arising after December 31, 2017, NOL carryforwards will be limited to 80% of taxable income. Our NOLs generated in 2017 and in prior years will not be subject to the 80% limitation under the Tax Act. In addition, we had state net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $332.7 million, which are available to offset future state taxable income. The state net operating loss carryforwards are inclusive of North Carolina net operating losses, which are recorded at zero benefit, as discussed in the income tax footnote. State net operating losses begin to expire in 2024. Because we had incurred cumulative net operating losses since inception, all tax years remain open to examination by U.S. federal and state income tax authorities. As of December 31, 2021, we also had federal research and development (R&D) credit carryforwards of approximately $17.0 million available to offset future income tax which begin to expire in 2035.\nOur ability to utilize net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards may be substantially limited due to ownership changes that may have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), as well as similar state provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of NOL and R&D credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change,\u201d as defined by Section 382 of the Code, results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percent of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups.\nIn April 2019, we completed an evaluation study as to whether an ownership change\u201d had occurred and determined that the limitation would be approximately $8.0 million on federal net operating loss carryforwards, $1.2 million on state net operating loss carryforwards, and $0.1 million on R&D tax credit carryforwards. The carryforward amounts reported above have already been reduced for these limitations. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance on the remaining NOLs and tax credits as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset associated with them will not be realized regardless of whether an ownership change\u201d has occurred.\nResults of operations\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020\nTable 311: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product sales, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,929\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,809\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 173,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 141,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (142,457\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (96,476\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45,981\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (909\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,667\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,778\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,889\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (346\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (542\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,970\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,368\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,602\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (147,427\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (97,844\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49,583\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (485\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (148,352\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (99,254\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (49,098\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct sales, net\nProduct sales, net was $11.1 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The sales revenue recognized in the current year was related to the product sales of COSELA. We received FDA approval of COSELA on February 12, 2021 and the product has been commercially available since March 2, 2021.\nLicense revenue\nLicense revenue was $20.4 million and $45.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. License revenue recognized in the current year was primarily related to $11.0 million in milestone payments from Genor and Simcere. We also recognized $2.5 million and $1.0 million in clinical trial costs reimbursed by EQRx and Simcere, respectively. Additionally, we recognized $5.9 million in supply, manufacturing services and patent reimbursable costs from EQRx, Genor, and Simcere. License revenue recognized in the prior year was primarily related to $42.1 million in revenue recognized from the Simcere, EQRx, Genor and ARC upfront payments under the respective license agreements following the transfer of related technology and know-how which occurred during the period. We also recognized $1.3 million for clinical trial costs reimbursed by EQRx and $0.4 million in patent costs to be reimbursed by EQRx, Genor, and Simcere. Additionally, we recognized $1.3 million in revenue for existing inventory transfers to EQRx and Genor which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nCost of goods sold\nCost of goods sold was $2.0 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Cost of goods sold includes our third-party logistics costs for the sales of COSELA, inventory overhead costs, and personnel costs.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses were $76.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $73.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $2.9 million, or 4%, was primarily due to an increase of $20.0 million in our clinical program costs, offset by a decrease of $16.2 million for manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product to support our clinical trials and a decrease of $0.9 million in external costs related to discovery and preclinical development. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses allocated to trilaciclib, rintodestrant, lerociclib, and unallocated research and development expenses for the periods indicated:\nTable 312: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical expenses-trilaciclib\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical expenses-rintodestrant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,132\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Clinical expenses-lerociclib\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Chemical manufacturing and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discovery and pre-clinical expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 73,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $95.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $27.2 million, or 40%, was due to an increase of $12.7 million in personnel related costs due to increased headcount, of which $5.4 million related to non-cash stock compensation expense, an increase of $12.1 million in commercialization activities, an increase of $2.2 in information technology systems and related expenses, and an increase of $0.2 million medical affairs costs related to trilaciclib, professional services, insurance, and other administrative costs.\nTotal other income (expense), net\nTotal other income (expense), net was $(5.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $(1.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease of $3.6 million, or -263%, was primarily driven and increase in interest expense on loan payable due to higher principal balance in 2021 as compared to 2020.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense was $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease of $0.5 million, or -34%, in foreign withhold taxes incurred is a result of a decrease in license revenue recognized from Simcere as compared to the prior.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019\nTable 313: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product sales, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of goods sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and Development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,731\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 141,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (96,476\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (129,041\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,627\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,778\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,778\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (542\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (557\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,368\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,962\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (97,844\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (122,447\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (99,254\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (122,447\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct sales, net\nProduct sales, net was $0 for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nLicense revenue\nLicense revenue was $45.3 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The license revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily related to $42.1 million in revenue recognized from the Simcere, EQRx, Genor and ARC upfront payments under the respective license agreements following the transfer of the related technology and know-how which occurred during the period. We also recognized $1.3 million for clinical trial costs and $0.4 million in patent costs to be reimbursed by EQRx, Genor, and Simcere.

The decrease of $15.7 million, or -18%, was primarily due to a decrease of $10.2 million in our clinical program costs due to a decrease in spend for ongoing clinical trials of $5.7 million and decrease of $5.9 million related to a regulatory filing expense of $2.9 million incurred in 2019 and reimbursed in 2020, partially offset by an increase in personnel costs of $1.4 million. The decrease of $1.3 million in costs for manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product to support our clinical trials, as well as a decrease in research and development expenses was also due to a decrease of $4.2 million in external costs related to discovery and preclinical development.

The increase of $28.5 million, or 71%, was due to an increase of $6.8 million in personnel related costs due to increased headcount, of which $1.7 million related to non-cash stock compensation expense, an increase of $15.8 million in expenses related to pre-commercialization activities, an increase of $2.0 million in medical affairs costs related to trilaciclib, an increase of $0.8 million in information technology systems and related expenses, and an increase of $3.1 million professional services, insurance, and other administrative costs.\nTotal other income (expense), net\nTotal other income (expense), net was $(1.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $8.0 million was primarily driven by a lower balance of money market funds due to cash used in operating activities and changes in interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expense on loan payable, and loss on disposal of fixed assets.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense was $1.4 million and $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The income tax expense recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the foreign withholding taxes incurred as a result of the upfront payment received from the Simcere license agreement entered into in 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred cumulative losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception in 2008. We incurred net losses of $148.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, $99.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $122.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $584.5 million.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $221.2 million. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through proceeds from our initial public offering, our follow-on stock offerings, our debt agreement with Hercules Capital, and proceeds from our license agreements. Under our licensing arrangements, we are eligible to receive certain development and sales-based milestones. Our ability to earn these milestones and the timing of achieving these milestones is primarily dependent upon the outcome of the licensee's activities and are uncertain at this time.\nShelf registration statement\nOn July 2, 2021, we filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d), which we refer to as the 2021 Form S-3. Each issuance under the shelf registration statement would have required the filing of a prospectus supplement identifying the amount and terms of securities to be issued. The 2021 Form S-3 did not limit the amount of securities that could have been issued thereunder.\nOn February 23, 2022, because we are no longer a well-known seasoned issuer\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, we filed an automatic post-effective amendment to the 2021 Form S-3 on Form POSASR, which became effective upon filing, to register for sale up to $300.0 million of any combination of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine and, as required by SEC rules, will file another post-effective amendment to the 2021 Form S-3 on Form POS AM after the filing of this Form 10-K. Once the post-effective amendment to the 2021 Form S-3 on Form POS AM has been declared effective by the SEC, the 2021 Form S-3 will remain in effect for up to three years from the date it originally became effective, which was July 2, 2021. We make no assurances as to our ability to continue to use the 2021 Form S-3.\nAt-the-market offerings\nOn June 15, 2018, we entered into a sales agreement for at the market offerings\u201d with Cowen and Company, LLC ( Cowen\u201d), which allows us to issue and sell shares of common stock pursuant to a shelf registration statement for total gross sales proceeds of up to $125.0 million from time to time through Cowen, acting as our agent. Between June 18, 2018 and August 2, 2018, we sold 752,008 shares of common stock pursuant to this agreement resulting in $36.1 million in net proceeds, realizing $12.1 million in the second quarter and the remaining $24.0 million by August 2, 2018.\nBetween January 14, 2021 and February 9, 2021, we sold 3,513,027 shares of common stock pursuant to this agreement resulting in $86.4 million in net proceeds. As of February 9, 2021, we have used the entirety of the remaining availability under the sales agreement with Cowen.\nIn connection with the 2021 Form S-3, on July 2, 2021, we entered into a sales agreement for at the market offerings\u201d with Cowen, which allowed us to issue and sell shares of common stock pursuant to the 2021 Form S-3 for total gross sales proceeds of up to $150.0 million from time to time through Cowen, acting as our agent (the 2021 Sales Agreement\u201d). We did not sell any shares of common stock or other securities under the 2021 Sales Agreement and we terminated the 2021 Sales Agreement on February 23, 2022. Also, on February 23, 2022, we entered into the 2022 Sales Agreement for at the market offerings\u201d with Cowen, which allows us to issue and sell shares of common stock pursuant to the 2021 Form S-3, once it has been post-effectively amended as noted above, for total gross sales proceeds of up to $100.0 million from time to time through Cowen, acting as our agent.\nLoan and Security Agreement with Hercules\nOn May 29, 2020, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. ( Hercules\u201d) under which Hercules has agreed to lend us up to $100.0 million, to be made available in a series of tranches, subject to specified conditions. We borrowed $20.0 million at loan closing. The term of the loan is approximately 48 months, with a maturity date of June 1, 2024. No principal payments are due during an interest-only period, commencing on the initial borrowing date and continuing through June 1, 2022. The interest only period may be extended through January 1, 2023 upon satisfaction of certain milestones. Following the interest only period, we will repay the principal balance and interest of the advances in equal monthly installments through June 1, 2024.\nOn March 31, 2021, we entered into the First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the First Amendment\u201d) with Hercules whereby the Company drew the remaining $10.0 million of the first tranche and the interest rate and financial covenants were amended. Unless loan advances exceeded $40.0 million, no financial covenants were required.\nOn November 1, 2021, we entered into a Second Amendment to the loan and security agreement with Hercules under which Hercules has agreed to lend us up to $150.0 million, to be made available in a series of tranches, subject to certain terms and conditions. The first tranche was increased to $100.0 million. At close of the Second Amendment, we borrowed an additional $45.0 million from Tranche 1 with $25.0 million remaining to be borrowed through September 15, 2022. No principal payments are due during an interest-only period, commencing on the close of the Second Amendment and continuing through December 1, 2024. The interest only period may be extended through December 1, 2025, in quarterly increments, subject to compliance with covenants of the Second Amendment. Following the interest only period, we will repay the principal balance and interest of the advances in equal monthly installments through the maturity date of November 1, 2026.\nCash flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 315: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (132,108\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (83,742\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (99,571\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided/used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,716\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 145,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (61,902\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (99,582\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in operating activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $132.1 million, which consisted of a net loss of $148.4 million and a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million, partially offset by an increase in non-cash equity interest of $0.4 million, non-cash stock compensation expense of $22.3 million, $0.5 million of depreciation expense, $1.1 million in amortization of debt issuance costs, $0.6 million of non-cash interest expense, and $0.2 million from loss on extinguishment of debt.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $83.7 million, which consisted of a net loss of $99.3 million, a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $4.0 million, and a decrease in non-cash equity interest of $0.9 million, partially offset by non-cash stock compensation expense of $18.8 million, $0.6 million of depreciation expense, $0.6 million in amortization of debt issuance costs, $0.3 million loss on disposal of fixed assets, and $0.2 million of non-cash interest expense.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $99.6 million, which consisted of a net loss of $122.4 million, partially offset by non-cash stock compensation expense of $16.4 million, working capital adjustments of $6.0 million and $0.4 million of depreciation expense.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 there was no cash provided or used in investing activities.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which represented proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which represented purchases of property and equipment, primarily associated with laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements for new office space.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $145.9 million, which consisted of $86.4 million in net proceeds from our ATM offering after deducting cash paid during the year for underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses, $55.0 million in proceeds from our loan agreement with Hercules, partially offset by $1.4 million in payments related to debt issuances costs, and $5.9 million in net proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $21.7 million, which consisted of $2.3 million in net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and $20.0 million in proceed from our loan agreement with Hercules, partially offset by $0.6 million in payments related to debt issuances costs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $2.7 million in net proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nOperating capital requirements and plan of operations\nTo date, we have generated limited revenue from product sales. We expect our expenses to increase as we continue the development of and seek additional regulatory approvals for trilaciclib, and continue to commercialize COSELA. We are subject to all of the risks inherent in the development of new products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our projected cash needs for greater than 12 months following the filing of this Annual Report.\nWe have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all of our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of nonclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates; \n \u2022 the scope, prioritization and number of our research and development programs; \n \u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; \n \u2022 the extent to which we enter into non-exclusive, jointly funded clinical research collaboration arrangements, if any, for the development of our product candidates in combination with other companies' products; \n \u2022 our ability to establish such collaborative co-development arrangements on favorable terms, if at all; \n \u2022 the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under our license agreement and any collaboration agreements into which we enter; \n \u2022 the extent to which we are obligated to reimburse, or entitled to reimbursement of, clinical trial costs under future collaboration agreements, if any; \n \u2022 the extent to which we acquire or in-license product candidates and technologies, such as rintodestrant, and the terms of such in-licenses; \n \u2022 the costs of commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; \n \u2022 revenue received from commercial sales of our product candidates; and \n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims. \nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds except for amounts included under our licensing arrangements and the loan agreement with Hercules. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders' ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our clinical trial commitments, consulting fees, operating lease commitments and long-term debt obligations. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021:\nTable 327: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 to 3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 to 5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligation, including interest and end of term charge (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations(3,4,5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 119,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents future minimum lease payments under the non-cancelable lease for our headquarters in Research Triangle Park, NC and our former headquarters in Research Triangle Park, NC. The lease for the new office space commenced in September 2019 for approximately 60,000 square feet of laboratory space and office space in Research Triangle Park, NC. The lease will expire in September 2027, with the Company having the option to renew for an additional 5 years. The lease for our former headquarters will expire in December 2022. The minimum lease payments above do not include any related common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes. \n (2) Amounts in the table reflect payments due for our Second Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules with outstanding borrowings of $75.0 million as of December 31, 2021. The amounts in the table above reflect interest-only payments through December 1, 2024 with payments on principal beginning thereafter. For purposes of the table above, interest payments were calculated using an annual interest rate of 9.15%, which was the interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, the table above includes end of term charges of $2.1 million due on June 1, 2025 and $5.1 million due upon maturity on November 1, 2026. See Note 8 of the financial statements for further discussion of the Hercules loan agreement. \n (3) We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with contract research organizations (CROs) for clinical trials and with vendors for preclinical studies and other services and products for operating purposes which are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30-60 days prior written notice. As of December 31, 2021, we have several on-going clinical studies in various stages. Under agreements with various CROs and clinical study sites, we incur expenses related to clinical studies of our product candidates and potential other clinical candidates. The timing and amounts of these disbursements are contingent upon the services rendered or as expenses are incurred by the CROs or clinical trial sites. Therefore, we cannot estimate the potential timing and amount of these payments and they have been excluded from the table above. Also, the above amounts exclude potential payments to be made under our license agreement for rintodestrant with the University of Illinois that are based on the progress of rintodestrant, as these payments are not determinable. \n (4) We entered into a Product Agreement with Patheon Manufacturing Services, LLC as issued under the Master Manufacturing Services Agreement dated August 27, 2019 to manufacture and supply trilaciclib for commercial production. The initial term of the agreement is effective until December 31, 2024. If the annual volume of product ordered does not meet a specified amount, a true-up payment to this minimum will be due at the end of the applicable year. This minimum purchase amount was excluded from the table above as the conditions of the committed amount make it undeterminable at this time. \n (5) We entered into a three-year co-promotion agreement in the United States and Puerto Rico with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or BI, in June 2020. In December 2021, G1 and BI announced that the parties mutually agreed to end the co-promotion agreement for COSELA, effective March 2022. At that time, we announced that we would hire and deploy a total of 34 oncology sales representatives to accelerate sales activities and help maximize the adoption of COSELA. For two years following the termination, sales payments to BI will be decreased to mid-single digit percentages of net sales. The sales payments will vary based on the level of net sales in an applicable year following the termination. Our obligations to make sales payments under the co-promotion agreement will terminate in March 2024. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our financial statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of patients with cancer. Our first product approved by the FDA, COSELA\u2122 (trilaciclib), is the first and only therapy indicated to proactively help protect bone marrow from the damage of chemotherapy and is the first innovation in managing myeloprotection in decades.\nWe shall use COSELA\u201d when referring to our FDA approved drug and trilaciclib\u201d when referring to our development of COSELA for additional indications.\nCOSELA is a prescription medicine used to help reduce the occurrence of low blood cell counts caused by damage to bone marrow from chemotherapy. COSELA is used to treat adults taking certain chemotherapies (platinum/etoposide or topotecan) for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.\nCOSELA is an injection for intravenous (IV) use given within 4 hours before chemotherapy.\nCommercial Product\nOn February 12, 2021, COSELA (trilaciclib) for injection was approved by the FDA to decrease the incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in adult patients treated with a platinum/etoposide-containing regimen or topotecan-containing regimen for ES-SCLC. We are also exploring potential use of trilaciclib in a variety of tumors, including colorectal cancer ( CRC\u201d), breast cancer, bladder cancer, and in trials designed to inform the design of future additional pivotal studies across multiple tumor types and treatment combinations including targeted chemotherapy medicines called antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs).\nIn June 2020, we entered into a three-year co-promotion agreement for COSELA in the United States and Puerto Rico with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In December 2021, G1 and Boehringer Ingelheim mutually agreed to end the co-promotion agreement for COSELA, effective March 2022. At that time, the Company announced that it would hire and deploy a total of 34 oncology sales representatives to allow G1 to target all accounts to accelerate sales activities and help maximize the adoption of COSELA. As of February 21, 2022, all 34 sales representatives have been hired, trained, and deployed.\nProduct Pipeline\nTrilaciclib is a first-in-class therapy designed to help protect against chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression.\nWe are executing on our tumor-agnostic strategy to evaluate the potential benefits of trilaciclib to patients with other tumors to continuously develop new data with trilaciclib in a variety of chemotherapeutic settings and in combination with other agents to maximize the applicability of the drug to potential future treatment paradigms. We currently have five on-going clinical trials: a pivotal trial in 1L colorectal cancer ( CRC\u201d), a pivotal trial in 1L mTNBC, a Phase 2 1L bladder cancer trial with chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor, a Phase 2 trial designed to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and myeloprotective benefit of trilaciclib administered prior to an antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC\u201d), and a Phase 2 trial in neoadjuvant TNBC designed to validate trilaciclib's immune-based mechanism of action ( MOA\u201d). These studies across treatment settings and tumor types will evaluate trilaciclib's dual benefits in both multi-lineage myeloprotection and anti-tumor efficacy. In addition, the MOA and ADC trials will inform the design of future additional pivotal studies across multiple tumor types and treatment combinations. The Company is also conducting significant preclinical work to assess the additive/synergistic potential of trilaciclib with a variety of novel and emerging therapeutic agents to identify synergies to evaluate in future clinical trials. G1's clinical approach to designing our clinical program includes monitoring the evolution of future standards of care and develop trilaciclib with these in mind, allowing us to conduct or support trials that will generate important data to maximize future usage in a variety of future settings.\n \n\nPFS=progression-free survival; OS=overall survival; PRO=patient reported outcome; ORR=overall response rate; pCR=pathological complete response; MOA=mechanism of action. *=initial results for Phase 2 trials expected in 4Q 2022\nLerociclib\nLerociclib is a differentiated oral CDK4/6 inhibitor being developed for use in combination with other targeted therapies in multiple oncology indications. In 2020, we entered into separate, exclusive agreements with EQRx, Inc. (rights for U.S., Europe, Japan and all markets outside Asia-Pacific) and Genor Biopharma Co. Inc. (rights for Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan) for the development and commercialization of lerociclib in all indications. Combined, these agreements provided $26.0 million in upfront payments, along with sales-based royalties, and the opportunity for up to $330.0 million in potential milestone payments. EQRx, Inc. and Genor Biopharma Co. Inc. are responsible for all costs related to the development and commercialization of lerociclib in their respective territories.\nRintodestrant\nRintodestrant is a clinical-stage oral SERD, for use as a monotherapy and in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors, initially Ibrance\u00ae (palbociclib), for the treatment of ER+, HER2- breast cancer. We are in the process of evaluating partnering options for rintodestrant.\nCDK2 Inhibitor\nIn 2020, we entered into a global license agreement with ARC Therapeutics, LLC for the development and commercialization of an internally discovered CDK2 inhibitor for all human and veterinary uses. ARC is currently granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing, license with the right to grant sublicenses to one of our solely owned patent families.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) impact on operations\nWe have implemented business continuity plans to address the COVID-19 pandemic and minimize disruptions to ongoing operations. Enrollment of patients in current and future clinical trials may be impacted by COVID-19. Although we have not had any significant supply chain delays or shortages as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to date, we have experienced delays in the delivery of our investigational product to certain investigative sites due to shortages of ancillary materials and the delay of governmental inspections. To date, we are on track to meet all of our previously announced clinical milestones. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues or increases in severity, we could experience disruptions to our clinical development timelines. If we experience delays in patient enrollment, we could incur increased clinical program expense if it is deemed necessary or advisable to improve patient recruitment by opening additional clinical sites. COVID-19 travel limitations and government-mandated work-from-home or shelter-in-place orders, may reduce the number of in-person meetings with prescribers and fewer patient visits with physicians, potentially resulting in fewer new prescriptions.\nWe established a COVID-19 response team which continually monitors the impact of COVID-19 on our operations. The COVID-19 response team manages our workplace protocols that govern our employees' use of our office. To mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business, we put in place the following safety measures for our employees, patients, healthcare professionals, and suppliers to limit exposure: we substantially restricted travel, supplied personal protective equipment to employees, limited access to our headquarters and asked most of our staff to work remotely. As of December 31, 2021, the majority of our employees are still working remotely, which may negatively impact our ability to conduct research and development activities, engage in sales-related initiatives, or efficiently conduct day-to-day operations. In addition, we added bandwidth and VPN capacity to our infrastructure to facilitate remote work arrangements. We will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, including how it will impact our employees, clinical trials, development programs, supply chain, and other aspects of our operations, and report to our Board of Directors regularly on the progress of our response to the COVID-19 outbreak.\nFinancial Overview\nSince our inception in 2008, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to synthesizing, acquiring, testing and developing our product candidates, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and providing selling, general and administrative support for these operations as well as securing intellectual property protection for our products. Currently, COSELA is our only product approved for sale. We began generating revenue for the net product sales from COSELA in March of 2021.We recorded $11.1 million of net product sales from COSELA and $20.4 million of license revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $45.3 million of license revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities, our loan agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc., and licensing arrangements. Under our licensing arrangements, we are eligible to receive certain development and sales-based milestones. Our ability to earn these milestones and the timing of achieving these milestones is primarily dependent upon the outcome of the licensee's activities and is uncertain at this time.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $221.2 million. Since inception, we have incurred net losses. Our net losses were $148.4 million, $99.3 million and $122.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $584.5 million. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs, our commercial launch of COSELA, and from selling, general and administrative expenses associated with our operations. We expect our research and development, commercial activities, and selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in connection with our ongoing and future activities as we:\n \u2022 continue development of trilaciclib, including initiation of additional clinical trials \n \u2022 identify and develop new product candidates; \n \u2022 seek additional marketing approvals for trilaciclib upon successful completion of clinical trials; \n \u2022 grow our sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize COSELA and any future products for which we may obtain marketing approval; \n \u2022 achieve market acceptance of our products in the medical community and with third-party payors; \n \u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u2022 hire additional personnel; \n \u2022 enter into collaboration arrangements, if any, for the development of our products or in-license other products and technologies; \n \u2022 identify and develop new product candidates; \n \u2022 add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and \n \u2022 continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company. \nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nOn February 12, 2021, COSELA was approved by the FDA and we began generating revenue for the product sales of COSELA in March 2021. Prior to the approval of COSELA, our revenues were derived solely from our license agreements.\nWe entered into an exclusive license agreement with Nanjing Simcere Dongyuan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd ( Simcere\u201d) in August 2020 and granted them the rights to develop and commercialize trilaciclib in Greater China (mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) (the Simcere Territory\u201d). We received an upfront payment of $14.0 million (less applicable withholding taxes of $1.4 million) in September 2020. This was recognized as revenue once the transfer of the license and related technology and know-how was completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. We have the potential to receive $156.0 million upon reaching development and commercial milestones, and receive tiered low double-digit royalties on annual net sales of trilaciclib in the Simcere Territory. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, three development milestones totaling $8.0 million (less applicable withholding taxes of $0.8 million) were received and recognized as revenue.\nWe entered into an exclusive license agreement with EQRx, Inc. ( EQRx\u201d) in July 2020 and granted them the rights to develop and commercialize lerociclib in the United States, Europe, Japan and all other global markets, excluding the Asia-Pacific region (except Japan) (the EQRx Territory\u201d). We received an upfront payment of $20.0 million in August 2020. This was recognized as revenue in September 2020 when we transferred the license and related technology and know-how. We have the potential to receive $290.0 million upon reaching development and commercial milestones, and receive tiered royalties ranging from mid-single digits to mid-teens based on annual net sales of lerociclib in the EQRx Territory.\nWe entered into an exclusive license agreement with Genor Biopharma Co. Inc. ( Genor\u201d) in June 2020 and granted them the rights to develop and commercialize lerociclib in the Asia-Pacific Region, excluding Japan (the Genor Territory\u201d). We received an upfront payment of $6.0 million in July 2020. This was recognized as revenue in September 2020 when we transferred the license and related technology and know-how. We have the potential to receive $40.0 million upon reaching development and commercial milestones, and receive tiered royalties ranging from high single to low double-digits based on annual net sales of lerociclib in the Genor Territory. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, one development milestone totaling $3.0 million was received and recognized as revenue.\nWe entered into an exclusive license agreement with ARC Therapeutics, LLC ( ARC\u201d) in May 2020. We granted ARC an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license of its CDK2 inhibitor compounds in exchange for an upfront payment and equity in ARC with a total value of approximately $2.1 million, which resulted in the recognition of related party revenue. We are entitled to receive additional milestone payments and sales-based royalties, and has right of first negotiation to re-acquire these assets.\nOperating expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into three categories: cost of goods sold, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense, comprise a significant component of each of these expense categories. We allocate expenses associated with personnel costs based on the nature of work associated with these resources.\nCost of goods sold\nCost of goods sold includes direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of COSELA, including third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight-in, third-party logistics costs associated with COSELA, and personnel costs. Cost of goods sold may also include period costs related to certain inventory manufacturing services and inventory adjustment charges.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nThe largest component of our total operating expenses since inception has been research and development activities, including the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Our research and development expense primarily consists of:\n \u2022 salaries and personnel-related costs, including bonuses, benefits and any stock-based compensation, for our scientific personnel performing or managing out-sourced research and development activities; \n \u2022 costs incurred under agreements with contract research organizations and investigative sites that conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials; \n \u2022 costs related to manufacturing pharmaceutical active ingredients and drug products for preclinical studies and clinical trials; \n \u2022 costs related to upfront and milestone payments under in-licensing agreements; \n \u2022 fees paid to consultants and other third parties who support our product development; \n \u2022 allocated facility-related costs and overhead. \nThe successful development of our products are highly uncertain. Products in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Accordingly, we expect research and development costs to increase as we conduct later stage clinical trials. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. Our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of products will depend on a variety of factors including:\n \u2022 the scope, rate of progress, and expenses of our ongoing as well as any additional clinical trials and other research and development activities; \n \u2022 future clinical trial results; \n \u2022 achievement of milestones requiring payments under our in-licensing agreements; \n \u2022 uncertainties in clinical trial enrollment rates or drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients; \n \u2022 potential additional studies requested by regulatory agencies; \n \u2022 significant and changing government regulation; and \n \u2022 the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals. \nWe track research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis only for clinical-stage product candidates. Preclinical research and development expenses and chemical manufacturing research and development expenses are not assigned or allocated to individual development programs. In 2021, we had two clinical-stage products, trilaciclib and rintodestrant.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, allocated expenses and other expenses for outside professional services, including legal, audit and accounting services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees, pre-commercialization costs, expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents and costs of our information systems. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research and development and commercialization of COSELA.\nWe expect to continue to incur additional selling, general and administrative expenses in the future in connection with the commercialization of COSELA, as we support continued research and development activities, and as we support our operations in a public company environment, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq, additional insurance expenses, and expenses related to investor relations activities.\nTotal other income (expense), net\nTotal other income (expense), net consists of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and interest expenses incurred under our loan and security agreement with Hercules.\nIncome taxes\nTo date, we have not been required to pay U.S. federal or state income taxes because we have not generated taxable income. Income tax expense recognized in 2021 and 2020 related to the foreign withholding taxes incurred as a result of the Simcere license agreement.\nCritical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor elements of those arrangements that we determine should be accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASC 606\u201d), we assess which activities in our license or collaboration agreements are performance obligations that should be accounted for separately and determine the transaction price of the arrangement, which includes the assessment of the probability of achievement of future milestones and other potential consideration. For arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, such as granting a license or performing manufacturing or research and development activities, we allocate the transaction price based on the relative standalone selling price and recognize revenue that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) control is transferred to the customer and the performance obligation is satisfied. Accordingly, we develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. These key assumptions may include revenue forecasts, clinical development timelines and costs, discount rates and probabilities of clinical and regulatory success.\nLicense Revenue\nLicenses of Intellectual Property\nIf a license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenue allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue associated with the bundled performance obligation. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of progress and related revenue recognition.\nMilestone Payments\nAt the inception of each arrangement that includes developmental and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the achievement of each milestone specifically relates to our efforts to satisfy a performance obligation or transfer a distinct good or service within a performance obligation. We evaluates each milestone to determine when and how much of the milestone to include in the transaction price. We first estimates the amount of the milestone payment that we could receive using either the expected value or the most likely amount approach. We primarily uses the most likely amount approach as that approach is generally most predictive for milestone payments with a binary outcome. Then, we considers whether any portion of that estimated amount is subject to the variable consideration constraint (that is, whether it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue would not occur upon resolution of the uncertainty). We update the estimate of variable consideration included in the transaction price at each reporting date which includes updating the assessment of the likely amount of consideration and the application of the constraint to reflect current facts and circumstances.\nRoyalties\nFor arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we will recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any revenue related to sales-based royalties or milestone payments based on the level of sales.\nProduct Sales, Net\nWe sell COSELA to specialty distributors in the U.S. and, in accordance with ASC 606, recognizes revenue at the point in time when the customer is deemed to have obtained control of the product. The customer is deemed to have obtained control of the product at the time of physical receipt of the product at the customers' distribution facilities, or Free on Board ( FOB\u201d) destination, the terms of which are designated in the contract.\nProduct sales are recorded at the net selling price, which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established for (a) rebates and chargebacks, (b) co-pay assistance programs, (c) distribution fees, (d) product returns, and (e) other discounts. Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes which are probability-weighted for relevant factors such as current contractual and statutory requirements, and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the applicable contract. The amount of variable consideration may be constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from estimates, we adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.\nLiabilities related to co-pay assistance, rebates, and GPO fees are classified as Accrued Expenses\u201d in the Condensed Balance Sheets. Discounts such as chargebacks, returns, and specialty distributor fees are recorded as a reduction to trade accounts receivable, which is included in Accounts Receivable\u201d in the Condensed Balance Sheets.\nForms of Variable Consideration\nRebates and Chargebacks: We estimate reductions to product sales for Public Health Service Institutions, such as Medicaid, Medicare and Veterans Administration ( VA\u201d) programs, as well as certain other qualifying federal and state government programs, and other group purchasing organizations. We estimate these reductions based upon our contracts with government agencies and other organizations, statutorily defined discounts and estimated payor mix. These organizations purchase directly from our specialty distributors at a discount and the specialty distributors charge us back the difference between the wholesaler price and the discounted price. Our liability for Medicaid rebates consists of estimates for claims that a state will make. We reserve for this discounted pricing is based on expected sales to qualified healthcare providers and the chargebacks that customers have already claimed.\nCo-pay assistance: Eligible patients who have commercial insurance may receive assistance from us to reduce the patient's out of pocket costs. Liabilities for co-pay assistance are calculated by actual program participation from third-party administrators.\nDistribution Fees: We have written contracts with its customers that include terms for distribution fees and costs for inventory management. We estimate and record distribution fees due to its customers based on gross sales.\nProduct Returns: We generally offers a right of return based on the product's expiration date and certain spoilage and damaged instances. We estimate the amount of product sales that may be returned and record the estimate as a reduction of product sales in the period the related product sales are recognized. Our estimates for expected returns are based primarily on an ongoing analysis of sales information and visibility into the inventory remaining in the distribution channel.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold includes direct and indirect costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of COSELA, including third-party manufacturing costs, packaging services, freight-in, third-party logistics costs associated with COSELA, and our personnel costs. Cost of goods sold may also include period costs related to certain inventory manufacturing services and inventory adjustment charges. In connection with the FDA approval of COSELA on February 12, 2021, we subsequently began capitalizing inventory manufactured or purchased after this date. As a result, certain manufacturing costs associated with product shipments of COSELA were expensed prior to FDA approval and, therefore, are not included in cost of goods sold during the current period.\nAccrued research and development expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we estimate and accrue research and development expenses, including external clinical study costs associated with clinical trial activities. The process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders, identifying services that have been provided on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs.\nCosts for clinical trial activities are recognized based on an evaluation of our vendors' progress towards completion of specific tasks, using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors regarding their actual costs incurred. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of individual contracts and payment timing may differ significantly from the period in which the services were performed. We determine accrual estimates through reports from and discussions with applicable personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials, or the services completed. Our estimates of accrued external clinical study costs as of each balance sheet date are based on the facts and circumstances known at the time.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from the amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of the services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred.\nStock-based compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. Our stock-based compensation awards have historically consisted of stock options.\nWe recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. We account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating forfeitures as of the date of grant.\nWe recorded non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $22.3 million, $18.8 million and $16.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the expected volatility of our common stock, the assumed dividend yield, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options, and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. In applying these assumptions, we considered the following factors:\n \u2022 we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common stock; we calculate expected volatility based on reported data for selected similar publicly traded companies for which the historical information is available as we do not have sufficient history to estimate volatility using only our common stock; in 2019, we began incorporating our historical stock price in conjunction with selected similar publicly traded companies; we plan to continue to use the guideline peer group volatility information until the historical volatility of our common stock is sufficient to measure expected volatility for future option grants; \n \u2022 the assumed dividend yield of zero is based on our expectation of not paying dividends for the foreseeable future; \n \u2022 our estimates of expected term used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were based on the estimated time from the grant date to the date of exercise; \n \u2022 we determine the risk-free interest rate by reference to implied yields available from U.S. Treasury securities with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant; and \n \u2022 we account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating forfeitures as of an award's grant date. \nSee Note 10 - Stock-Based Compensation\u201d to the accompanying audited financial statements included in Item 15 of this Annual Report for the weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for awards granted in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nPrior to our initial public offering, the fair value of our common shares underlying our stock options was estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. In order to determine the fair value of our common shares underlying granted stock options, our board of directors considered, among other things, timely valuations of our common shares prepared by an unrelated third-party valuation firm in accordance with the guidance provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.\nGiven the absence of a public trading market for our common shares, our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered a number of objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common shares, including (1) our business, financial condition and results of operations, including related industry trends affecting our operations; (2) our forecasted operating performance and projected future cash flows; (3) the illiquid nature of our common shares; (4) liquidation preferences and other rights and privileges of our common shares; (5) market multiples of our most comparable public peers and (6) market conditions affecting our industry. Since our IPO, our board of directors has determined the fair value of each common share underlying share-based awards based on the closing price of our common shares as reported by the Nasdaq on the date of grant.\nIncome taxes\nWe recognize deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. We periodically evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Based upon the weight of the available evidence, which includes historical operating performance, reported cumulative net losses since inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results, we maintained a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets for all periods presented. We intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets for the foreseeable future until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance.\nAt December 31, 2021, we have federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs\u201d) of approximately $510.0 million, which are available to offset future taxable income. Of the $510.0 million available, $95.4 million will begin to expire in 2029. The remaining $414.6 million has an indefinite carryforward period. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act\u201d), federal NOLs arising after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely. However, for NOLs arising after December 31, 2017, NOL carryforwards will be limited to 80% of taxable income. Our NOLs generated in 2017 and in prior years will not be subject to the 80% limitation under the Tax Act. In addition, we had state net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $332.7 million, which are available to offset future state taxable income. The state net operating loss carryforwards are inclusive of North Carolina net operating losses, which are recorded at zero benefit, as discussed in the income tax footnote. State net operating losses begin to expire in 2024. Because we had incurred cumulative net operating losses since inception, all tax years remain open to examination by U.S. federal and state income tax authorities. As of December 31, 2021, we also had federal research and development (R&D) credit carryforwards of approximately $17.0 million available to offset future income tax which begin to expire in 2035.\nOur ability to utilize net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards may be substantially limited due to ownership changes that may have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), as well as similar state provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of NOL and R&D credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change,\u201d as defined by Section 382 of the Code, results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percent of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups.\nIn April 2019, we completed an evaluation study as to whether an ownership change\u201d had occurred and determined that the limitation would be approximately $8.0 million on federal net operating loss carryforwards, $1.2 million on state net operating loss carryforwards, and $0.1 million on R&D tax credit carryforwards. The carryforward amounts reported above have already been reduced for these limitations. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance on the remaining NOLs and tax credits as we believe that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset associated with them will not be realized regardless of whether an ownership change\u201d has occurred.\nResults of operations\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020\n\nProduct sales, net\nProduct sales, net was $11.1 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The sales revenue recognized in the current year was related to the product sales of COSELA. We received FDA approval of COSELA on February 12, 2021 and the product has been commercially available since March 2, 2021.\nLicense revenue\nLicense revenue was $20.4 million and $45.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. License revenue recognized in the current year was primarily related to $11.0 million in milestone payments from Genor and Simcere. We also recognized $2.5 million and $1.0 million in clinical trial costs reimbursed by EQRx and Simcere, respectively. Additionally, we recognized $5.9 million in supply, manufacturing services and patent reimbursable costs from EQRx, Genor, and Simcere. License revenue recognized in the prior year was primarily related to $42.1 million in revenue recognized from the Simcere, EQRx, Genor and ARC upfront payments under the respective license agreements following the transfer of related technology and know-how which occurred during the period. We also recognized $1.3 million for clinical trial costs reimbursed by EQRx and $0.4 million in patent costs to be reimbursed by EQRx, Genor, and Simcere. Additionally, we recognized $1.3 million in revenue for existing inventory transfers to EQRx and Genor which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nCost of goods sold\nCost of goods sold was $2.0 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Cost of goods sold includes our third-party logistics costs for the sales of COSELA, inventory overhead costs, and personnel costs.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses were $76.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $73.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $2.9 million, or 4%, was primarily due to an increase of $20.0 million in our clinical program costs, offset by a decrease of $16.2 million for manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product to support our clinical trials and a decrease of $0.9 million in external costs related to discovery and preclinical development. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses allocated to trilaciclib, rintodestrant, lerociclib, and unallocated research and development expenses for the periods indicated:\n\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $95.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $27.2 million, or 40%, was due to an increase of $12.7 million in personnel related costs due to increased headcount, of which $5.4 million related to non-cash stock compensation expense, an increase of $12.1 million in commercialization activities, an increase of $2.2 in information technology systems and related expenses, and an increase of $0.2 million medical affairs costs related to trilaciclib, professional services, insurance, and other administrative costs.\nTotal other income (expense), net\nTotal other income (expense), net was $(5.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $(1.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease of $3.6 million, or -263%, was primarily driven and increase in interest expense on loan payable due to higher principal balance in 2021 as compared to 2020.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense was $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease of $0.5 million, or -34%, in foreign withhold taxes incurred is a result of a decrease in license revenue recognized from Simcere as compared to the prior.\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019\n\nProduct sales, net\nProduct sales, net was $0 for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nLicense revenue\nLicense revenue was $45.3 million and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The license revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily related to $42.1 million in revenue recognized from the Simcere, EQRx, Genor and ARC upfront payments under the respective license agreements following the transfer of the related technology and know-how which occurred during the period. We also recognized $1.3 million for clinical trial costs and $0.4 million in patent costs to be reimbursed by EQRx, Genor, and Simcere. Additionally, we recognized $1.3 million in revenue for existing inventory transfers to EQRx and Genor which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nCost of goods sold\nCost of goods sold was $0 for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses were $73.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $89.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $15.7 million, or -18%, was primarily due to a decrease of $10.2 million in our clinical program costs due to a decrease in spend for ongoing clinical trials of $5.7 million and decrease of $5.9 million related to a regulatory filing expense of $2.9 million incurred in 2019 and reimbursed in 2020, partially offset by an increase in personnel costs of $1.4 million. The decrease of $1.3 million in costs for manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product to support our clinical trials, as well as a decrease in research and development expenses was also due to a decrease of $4.2 million in external costs related to discovery and preclinical development. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses allocated to trilaciclib, rintodestrant, lerociclib, and unallocated research and development expenses for the periods indicated:\n\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $40.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $28.5 million, or 71%, was due to an increase of $6.8 million in personnel related costs due to increased headcount, of which $1.7 million related to non-cash stock compensation expense, an increase of $15.8 million in expenses related to pre-commercialization activities, an increase of $2.0 million in medical affairs costs related to trilaciclib, an increase of $0.8 million in information technology systems and related expenses, and an increase of $3.1 million professional services, insurance, and other administrative costs.\nTotal other income (expense), net\nTotal other income (expense), net was $(1.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $8.0 million was primarily driven by a lower balance of money market funds due to cash used in operating activities and changes in interest rates during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, interest expense on loan payable, and loss on disposal of fixed assets.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense was $1.4 million and $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The income tax expense recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the foreign withholding taxes incurred as a result of the upfront payment received from the Simcere license agreement entered into in 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred cumulative losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception in 2008. We incurred net losses of $148.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, $99.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $122.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $584.5 million.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $221.2 million. To date, we have funded our operations primarily through proceeds from our initial public offering, our follow-on stock offerings, our debt agreement with Hercules Capital, and proceeds from our license agreements. Under our licensing arrangements, we are eligible to receive certain development and sales-based milestones. Our ability to earn these milestones and the timing of achieving these milestones is primarily dependent upon the outcome of the licensee's activities and are uncertain at this time.\nShelf registration statement\nOn July 2, 2021, we filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d), which we refer to as the 2021 Form S-3. Each issuance under the shelf registration statement would have required the filing of a prospectus supplement identifying the amount and terms of securities to be issued. The 2021 Form S-3 did not limit the amount of securities that could have been issued thereunder.\nOn February 23, 2022, because we are no longer a well-known seasoned issuer\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, we filed an automatic post-effective amendment to the 2021 Form S-3 on Form POSASR, which became effective upon filing, to register for sale up to $300.0 million of any combination of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine and, as required by SEC rules, will file another post-effective amendment to the 2021 Form S-3 on Form POS AM after the filing of this Form 10-K. Once the post-effective amendment to the 2021 Form S-3 on Form POS AM has been declared effective by the SEC, the 2021 Form S-3 will remain in effect for up to three years from the date it originally became effective, which was July 2, 2021. We make no assurances as to our ability to continue to use the 2021 Form S-3.\nAt-the-market offerings\nOn June 15, 2018, we entered into a sales agreement for at the market offerings\u201d with Cowen and Company, LLC ( Cowen\u201d), which allows us to issue and sell shares of common stock pursuant to a shelf registration statement for total gross sales proceeds of up to $125.0 million from time to time through Cowen, acting as our agent. Between June 18, 2018 and August 2, 2018, we sold 752,008 shares of common stock pursuant to this agreement resulting in $36.1 million in net proceeds, realizing $12.1 million in the second quarter and the remaining $24.0 million by August 2, 2018.\nBetween January 14, 2021 and February 9, 2021, we sold 3,513,027 shares of common stock pursuant to this agreement resulting in $86.4 million in net proceeds. As of February 9, 2021, we have used the entirety of the remaining availability under the sales agreement with Cowen.\nIn connection with the 2021 Form S-3, on July 2, 2021, we entered into a sales agreement for at the market offerings\u201d with Cowen, which allowed us to issue and sell shares of common stock pursuant to the 2021 Form S-3 for total gross sales proceeds of up to $150.0 million from time to time through Cowen, acting as our agent (the 2021 Sales Agreement\u201d). We did not sell any shares of common stock or other securities under the 2021 Sales Agreement and we terminated the 2021 Sales Agreement on February 23, 2022. Also, on February 23, 2022, we entered into the 2022 Sales Agreement for at the market offerings\u201d with Cowen, which allows us to issue and sell shares of common stock pursuant to the 2021 Form S-3, once it has been post-effectively amended as noted above, for total gross sales proceeds of up to $100.0 million from time to time through Cowen, acting as our agent.\nLoan and Security Agreement with Hercules\nOn May 29, 2020, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. ( Hercules\u201d) under which Hercules has agreed to lend us up to $100.0 million, to be made available in a series of tranches, subject to specified conditions. We borrowed $20.0 million at loan closing. The term of the loan is approximately 48 months, with a maturity date of June 1, 2024. No principal payments are due during an interest-only period, commencing on the initial borrowing date and continuing through June 1, 2022. The interest only period may be extended through January 1, 2023 upon satisfaction of certain milestones. Following the interest only period, we will repay the principal balance and interest of the advances in equal monthly installments through June 1, 2024.\nOn March 31, 2021, we entered into the First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the First Amendment\u201d) with Hercules whereby the Company drew the remaining $10.0 million of the first tranche and the interest rate and financial covenants were amended. Unless loan advances exceeded $40.0 million, no financial covenants were required.\nOn November 1, 2021, we entered into a Second Amendment to the loan and security agreement with Hercules under which Hercules has agreed to lend us up to $150.0 million, to be made available in a series of tranches, subject to certain terms and conditions. The first tranche was increased to $100.0 million. At close of the Second Amendment, we borrowed an additional $45.0 million from Tranche 1 with $25.0 million remaining to be borrowed through September 15, 2022. No principal payments are due during an interest-only period, commencing on the close of the Second Amendment and continuing through December 1, 2024. The interest only period may be extended through December 1, 2025, in quarterly increments, subject to compliance with covenants of the Second Amendment. Following the interest only period, we will repay the principal balance and interest of the advances in equal monthly installments through the maturity date of November 1, 2026.\nCash flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n\nNet cash used in operating activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $132.1 million, which consisted of a net loss of $148.4 million and a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $8.8 million, partially offset by an increase in non-cash equity interest of $0.4 million, non-cash stock compensation expense of $22.3 million, $0.5 million of depreciation expense, $1.1 million in amortization of debt issuance costs, $0.6 million of non-cash interest expense, and $0.2 million from loss on extinguishment of debt.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $83.7 million, which consisted of a net loss of $99.3 million, a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $4.0 million, and a decrease in non-cash equity interest of $0.9 million, partially offset by non-cash stock compensation expense of $18.8 million, $0.6 million of depreciation expense, $0.6 million in amortization of debt issuance costs, $0.3 million loss on disposal of fixed assets, and $0.2 million of non-cash interest expense.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $99.6 million, which consisted of a net loss of $122.4 million, partially offset by non-cash stock compensation expense of $16.4 million, working capital adjustments of $6.0 million and $0.4 million of depreciation expense.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 there was no cash provided or used in investing activities.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which represented proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which represented purchases of property and equipment, primarily associated with laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements for new office space.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by financing activities was $145.9 million, which consisted of $86.4 million in net proceeds from our ATM offering after deducting cash paid during the year for underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses, $55.0 million in proceeds from our loan agreement with Hercules, partially offset by $1.4 million in payments related to debt issuances costs, and $5.9 million in net proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $21.7 million, which consisted of $2.3 million in net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and $20.0 million in proceed from our loan agreement with Hercules, partially offset by $0.6 million in payments related to debt issuances costs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $2.7 million in net proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nOperating capital requirements and plan of operations\nTo date, we have generated limited revenue from product sales. We expect our expenses to increase as we continue the development of and seek additional regulatory approvals for trilaciclib, and continue to commercialize COSELA. We are subject to all of the risks inherent in the development of new products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our projected cash needs for greater than 12 months following the filing of this Annual Report.\nWe have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all of our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of nonclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates; \n \u2022 the scope, prioritization and number of our research and development programs; \n \u2022 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; \n \u2022 the extent to which we enter into non-exclusive, jointly funded clinical research collaboration arrangements, if any, for the development of our product candidates in combination with other companies' products; \n \u2022 our ability to establish such collaborative co-development arrangements on favorable terms, if at all; \n \u2022 the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under our license agreement and any collaboration agreements into which we enter; \n \u2022 the extent to which we are obligated to reimburse, or entitled to reimbursement of, clinical trial costs under future collaboration agreements, if any; \n \u2022 the extent to which we acquire or in-license product candidates and technologies, such as rintodestrant, and the terms of such in-licenses; \n \u2022 the costs of commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; \n \u2022 revenue received from commercial sales of our product candidates; and \n \u2022 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims. \nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. We do not have any committed external source of funds except for amounts included under our licensing arrangements and the loan agreement with Hercules. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders' ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our clinical trial commitments, consulting fees, operating lease commitments and long-term debt obligations. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021:\n\n (1) Represents future minimum lease payments under the non-cancelable lease for our headquarters in Research Triangle Park, NC and our former headquarters in Research Triangle Park, NC. The lease for the new office space commenced in September 2019 for approximately 60,000 square feet of laboratory space and office space in Research Triangle Park, NC. The lease will expire in September 2027, with the Company having the option to renew for an additional 5 years. The lease for our former headquarters will expire in December 2022. The minimum lease payments above do not include any related common area maintenance charges or real estate taxes. \n (2) Amounts in the table reflect payments due for our Second Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement with Hercules with outstanding borrowings of $75.0 million as of December 31, 2021. The amounts in the table above reflect interest-only payments through December 1, 2024 with payments on principal beginning thereafter. For purposes of the table above, interest payments were calculated using an annual interest rate of 9.15%, which was the interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, the table above includes end of term charges of $2.1 million due on June 1, 2025 and $5.1 million due upon maturity on November 1, 2026. See Note 8 of the financial statements for further discussion of the Hercules loan agreement. \n (3) We enter into agreements in the normal course of business with contract research organizations (CROs) for clinical trials and with vendors for preclinical studies and other services and products for operating purposes which are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30-60 days prior written notice. As of December 31, 2021, we have several on-going clinical studies in various stages. Under agreements with various CROs and clinical study sites, we incur expenses related to clinical studies of our product candidates and potential other clinical candidates. The timing and amounts of these disbursements are contingent upon the services rendered or as expenses are incurred by the CROs or clinical trial sites. Therefore, we cannot estimate the potential timing and amount of these payments and they have been excluded from the table above. Also, the above amounts exclude potential payments to be made under our license agreement for rintodestrant with the University of Illinois that are based on the progress of rintodestrant, as these payments are not determinable. \n (4) We entered into a Product Agreement with Patheon Manufacturing Services, LLC as issued under the Master Manufacturing Services Agreement dated August 27, 2019 to manufacture and supply trilaciclib for commercial production. The initial term of the agreement is effective until December 31, 2024. If the annual volume of product ordered does not meet a specified amount, a true-up payment to this minimum will be due at the end of the applicable year. This minimum purchase amount was excluded from the table above as the conditions of the committed amount make it undeterminable at this time. \n (5) We entered into a three-year co-promotion agreement in the United States and Puerto Rico with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or BI, in June 2020. In December 2021, G1 and BI announced that the parties mutually agreed to end the co-promotion agreement for COSELA, effective March 2022. At that time, we announced that we would hire and deploy a total of 34 oncology sales representatives to accelerate sales activities and help maximize the adoption of COSELA. For two years following the termination, sales payments to BI will be decreased to mid-single digit percentages of net sales. The sales payments will vary based on the level of net sales in an applicable year following the termination. Our obligations to make sales payments under the co-promotion agreement will terminate in March 2024. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have, during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report

biopharmaceutical company, which focuses on the development and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Their flagship product, COSELA\u2122 (trilaciclib), has been approved by the FDA and is used to protect bone marrow from chemotherapy damage in adult patients with small cell lung cancer. Development and commercialization rights are owned by G1 Therapeutics, except in Greater China.\n\nThe company's product pipeline includes ongoing clinical trials for various cancers, with trilaciclib being a core focus. The report mentions significant cooperative activities, including a terminated co-promotion agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim and new sales initiatives implemented by the company.\n\nFinancially, the company began generating revenue from COSELA sales in March 2021, with $11.1 million of net product sales and $20.4 million of license revenue in 2021. The company relies primarily on equity securities sales, licensing arrangements, and a loan agreement with Hercules Capital for funding. As of December 31, 2021, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $221.2 million, with accumulated deficit standing at $584.5 million.\n\nKey contractual obligations include operating lease obligations for office space and a long-term debt obligation, including interest, with Hercules Capital. The company's future funding requirements will depend on various factors, including the progress and results of its research and development programs, regulatory approvals, collaborative arrangements, and potential in-licensing of new products.\n\nFinally, the company's liquidity is expected to support projected cash needs for more than 12 months beyond filing this report, and plans are in place to secure additional funding through equity offerings, debt financings, and other financial activities if necessary.\n\nThe financial tables at the end summarize the company's cash flows, showcasing net cash used in operating activities, cash provided or used in investing activities, and cash provided by financing activities for the years 2019-2021.
