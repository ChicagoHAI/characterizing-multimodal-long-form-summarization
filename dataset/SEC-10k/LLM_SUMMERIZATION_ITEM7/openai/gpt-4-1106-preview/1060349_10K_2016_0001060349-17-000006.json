( AC\u201d) and its subsidiaries along with certain cash and other assets (the Spin-off\u201d). AC owns and operates, directly or indirectly, the alternatives and the institutional research businesses previously owned and operated by GBL. In the Spin-off, each holder of GAMCO's Class A Common Stock ( Class A Stock\u201d) of record as of 5:00 p.m. New York City time on November 12, 2015 (the Record Date\u201d), received one share of AC Class A common stock for each share of GAMCO Class A Stock held on the Record Date. Each record holder of GAMCO's Class B Stock received one share of AC Class B common stock for each share of GAMCO Class B Stock held on the Record Date. Subsequent to the Spin-off, GAMCO no longer consolidates the financial results of AC for the purposes of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of AC have been reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the Spin-off Date. Historical AUM have similarly been adjusted to remove AUM managed by AC.\nOur revenues are highly correlated to the level of AUM and fees associated with our various investment products, rather than our own corporate assets. AUM, which are directly influenced by the level and changes of the overall equity markets, can also fluctuate through acquisitions, the creation of new products, the addition of new accounts or the loss of existing accounts. Since various equity products have different fees, changes in our business mix may also affect revenues. At times, the performance of our equity products may differ markedly from popular market indices, and this can also impact our revenues. It is our belief that general stock market trends will have the greatest impact on our level of AUM and hence, revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $39.7 billion of AUM. We conduct our investment advisory business principally through: GAMCO (Institutional and Private Wealth Management), and Funds Advisor (Funds). We also are a distributor of our open-end funds through our broker-dealer subsidiary G.distributors.\nOrganizational Chart\nSubsequent to the Spin-off, this is the current organizational chart of the Company.\n2016 Business and Investment Highlights\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> On December 1, 2016, the Company launched Gabelli Media Mogul (NYSE: MOGLC), its first in a series of actively managed, non-transparent exchange traded managed funds ( ETMFs\u201d). Gabelli Media Mogul will invest primarily in the media industry; specifically in companies that were spun-off from Dr. John Malone's Liberty Media Corporation ( Liberty Media\u201d) as constituted in 2001, including companies formed through subsequent mergers of those spin-offs and companies in which Liberty Media and its successors have invested.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> On October 4, 2016, the Company announced that Katrina O'Leary joined GAMCO's institutional team as Vice President, head of Consultant Relations. Ms. O'Leary will launch a dedicated effort to develop the firm's relationships with the global consulting community. The role underscores GAMCO's commitment to delivering superior risk adjusted returns and providing best in class client service in a rapidly changing investment environment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> On August 15, 2016, the Company issued a $110 million five year convertible note to Cascade Investment, L.L.C. in a private transaction.

This newly organized closed-end fund initially traded on the NYSE MKT as a $100 combination consisting of one preferred share at $40 and three common shares at $19 each under the symbol GGO.C. This innovative offering demonstrates the flexibility of the closed-end fund structure. Separate trading on the NYSE MKT for the common shares ( GGO\u201d) and the Series A Preferred shares ( GGO.A\u201d) commenced on November 2, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> 2016 was the first full year of advising the Bancroft Fund, and Ellsworth Growth and Income Fund. The Dinsmore team now manages over $350 million in AUM across three closed-end funds. 2016 was also the first full year of advising The Gabelli Value Plus+ Trust, our first London Stock Exchange listed closed-end fund. The Fund had $171 million of AUM at December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Net debt improved from $262.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $156.9 million at December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nInvestment advisory and incentive fees, which are based on the amount and composition of AUM in our Funds, Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts, represent our largest source of revenues. In addition to the general level and trends of the stock market, growth in revenues depends on good investment performance, which influences the value of existing AUM as well as contributes to higher investment and lower redemption rates and facilitates the ability to attract additional investors while maintaining current fee levels. Growth in AUM is also dependent on being able to access various distribution channels, which is usually based on several factors, including performance and service. A majority of our cash inflows to mutual fund products have come through third party distribution programs, including NTF programs. We have also been engaged to act as a sub-advisor for other much larger financial services companies with much larger sales distribution organizations. These sub-advisory clients are subject to business combinations that may result in the termination of the relationship. The loss of a sub-advisory relationship could have a significant impact on our financial results in the future.\nAdvisory fees from the open-end funds, closed-end funds and sub-advisory accounts are computed daily or weekly based on average net assets. Advisory fees from Institutional and Private Wealth Management clients are generally computed quarterly based on account values as of the end of the preceding quarter. These revenues are based on AUM which is highly correlated to the stock market and can vary in direct proportion to movements in the stock market and the level of sales compared with redemptions, financial market conditions and the fee structure for AUM. Revenues derived from the equity-oriented portfolios generally have higher management fee rates than fixed income portfolios.\nWe also receive incentive fees from certain Institutional and Private Wealth Management clients, which are based upon meeting or exceeding a specific benchmark index or indices. These fees are recognized at the end of the stipulated contract period, which may be quarterly or annually, for the respective account. Management fees on assets attributable to a majority of the closed-end preferred shares are earned at year-end if the total return to common shareholders of the closed-end fund for the calendar year exceeds the dividend rate of the preferred shares. These fees are recognized at the end of the measurement period.\nDistribution fees and other income primarily include distribution fee revenue earned in accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the Company Act, as amended, along with sales charges and underwriting fees associated with the sale of the mutual funds plus other revenues. Distribution fees fluctuate based on the level of AUM and the amount and type of mutual funds sold directly by G.distributors or through various distribution channels.\nCompensation costs include variable and fixed compensation and related expenses paid to officers, portfolio managers, sales, trading, research and all other professional staff. Variable compensation paid to sales personnel and portfolio management generally represents 40% of revenues and is the largest component of total compensation costs. Distribution costs include marketing, product distribution and promotion costs. Management fee is incentive-based and entirely variable compensation in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits which is paid to Mr. Gabelli or his designee for acting as CEO pursuant to his 2008 Employment Agreement so long as he is an executive of GBL and devotes the substantial majority of his working time to the business. Other operating expenses include general and administrative operating costs.\nOther income and expenses include net gains and losses from investments (which includes both realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading securities), interest and dividend income, and interest expense. Net gains and losses from investments are derived from our proprietary investment portfolio consisting of various public and private investments.\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the share of net income attributable to the minority stockholders, as reported on a separate company basis, of our consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries and net income attributable to third party limited partners of certain partnerships and offshore funds we consolidate. Please refer to Note A in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nIncome/(loss) on discontinued operations, net of taxes represents the results of the businesses and assets that were part of the Spin-off of AC. Please refer to Note P in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition\nWe ended the 2016 year with approximately $77.1 million in cash and investments. The $77.1 million consists of $39.8 million cash and cash equivalents, primarily invested in our 100% U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund, $0.1 million invested in common stocks and available for sale ( AFS\u201d) securities of $37.2 million. Of the $37.2 million of AFS securities, $37.1 million represent our investment in shares of Westwood Holdings Group.\nThe face value of our debt consisted of $100 million of a 4% PIK Note due to AC, $110 million of a 4.5% convertible note due August 15, 2021 and $24.2 million of 5.875% senior notes due June 1, 2021.\nEquity was a negative $166.6 million on December 31, 2016 compared to a negative $276.3 million on December 31, 2015.\nWe filed a shelf registration with the SEC in 2015 which, among other things, provides us the flexibility to sell any combination of senior and subordinate debt securities, convertible debt securities, equity securities (including common and preferred stock), and other securities up to a total amount of $500 million. The shelf is available through April 10, 2018, at which time it may be renewed.\nOur primary short-term goal is to use our liquid resources to pay down our existing debt. As a secondary goal, we will look to opportunistically and strategically grow operating income at what we consider a margin of safety. We will also consider alternatives to return capital to our shareholders including stock repurchases and dividends.\nAssets Under Management Highlights\nWe reported assets under management as follows

Equity AUM were $37.9 billion on December 31, 2016, 2.2% above the $37.1 billion on December 31, 2015. We earn incentive fees for certain institutional client assets, assets attributable to certain preferred issues for our closed-end funds and our GDL Fund (NYSE: GDL). As of December 31, 2016, assets with incentive based fees were $2.5 billion, 7.4% below the $2.7 billion on December 31, 2015. The majority of these assets have calendar year-end measurement periods; therefore, our incentive fees are primarily recognized in the fourth quarter when the uncertainty is removed at the end of the annual measurement period.\nOperating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenues\nTotal revenues were $353.0 million in 2016, $28.0 million or 7.3% lower than the total revenues of $381.0 million in 2015.

Average total AUM declined 10.0% to $38.9 billion in 2016 as compared to $43.2 billion in 2015. Average equity AUM fell 10.6% to $37.2 billion in 2016 from $41.6 billion in 2015, primarily from net outflows. Incentive fees, which comprised 4.4% of total revenues in 2016, result from our ability to either generate an absolute return in a portfolio or meet or exceed a specific benchmark index or indices and can vary significantly from one period to another. Incentive fees were higher in 2016 as a greater number of portfolios exceeded their respective benchmarks as compared to 2015.\nFund revenues decreased $14.9 million or 7.0%, to $199.3 million, driven by lower average AUM. Revenue from open-end funds decreased $21.9 million, or 14.4%, to $130.0 million from the prior year as average AUM in 2016 decreased $2.2 billion, or 12.6%, to $15.2 billion from the $17.4 billion in 2014. Closed-end fund revenues increased $7.0 million, or 11.2%, to $69.3 million from the prior year and was comprised of an increase of $7.8 million in incentive fees on certain closed-end fund AUM partially reduced by a decrease of $0.8 million in investment advisory fees attributable to lower average AUM. Revenue from Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts, excluding incentive fees, which are generally billed on beginning quarter AUM, decreased $11.7 million, or 10.3%, principally due to lower billable AUM levels throughout the course of 2016. Incentive fees earned on certain accounts increased by $1.7 million. In 2016, average AUM in our equity Institutional and Private Wealth Management business decreased $2.1 billion, or 11.1%, for the year to $16.8 billion.\nDistribution Fees and Other Income: Distribution fees and other income decreased $6.5 million, or 12.7%, to $44.5 million in 2016 from $51.0 million in 2015. Lower distribution fees of $41.0 million in 2016 versus $47.7 million for the prior year, principally as a result of decreased average AUM in our open-end equity mutual funds of 13.7%, offset by an increase of $0.2 million in fees from the sale of load shares of mutual funds and other income, contributed to this decrease.\nExpenses\nCompensation: Total compensation costs, which are largely variable in nature, decreased $53.9 million, or 39.5%, to $82.6 million in 2016 from $136.5 million in 2015. Variable compensation costs, principally portfolio manager and relationship manager fees, decreased $53.6 million to $56.6 million in 2016 from $110.2 million in 2015 and decreased as a percent of revenues to 16.0% in 2016 from 28.9% in 2015. The principle reason was the December 2015 Restricted Stock Units ( RSU\u201d) agreement with Mr. Gabelli which reduced variable compensation by $44.6 million in 2016. (see page 34) Variable compensation is also driven by revenue levels which decreased in 2016 from 2015. Fixed compensation costs decreased slightly to $26.0 million in 2016 from $26.3 million in 2015.\nStock based compensation: Stock based compensation was $4.0 million in 2016, a decrease of $5.9 million, as compared to $9.9 million in 2015. The decrease primarily results from the acceleration of 130,650 RSAs during 2015 for an additional expense of $3.5 million that would have been recognized in future years.\nManagement Fee: In 2016 management fee expense decreased to $6.5 million versus $15.5 million in 2015. Management fee expense is incentive-based and entirely variable in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits which is paid to Mr. Gabelli (or his designee) in accordance with his employment agreement. Most importantly the December 2015 RSU agreement reduced the management fee by $12.4 million in 2016. (see page 34)\nDistribution Costs: Distribution costs, which include marketing, promotion and distribution costs decreased $7.8 million, or 15.0%, to $44.2 million in 2016 from $52.0 million in 2015 driven by a decrease in average open-end equity mutual funds AUM of 13.7%.\nOther Operating Expenses: Our other operating expenses were $23.9 million in 2016 compared to $19.2 million in 2015, an increase of $4.7 million or 24.4%. The largest components of this increase were additional donated securities expense of $1.6 million and an increase to the research services fee of $1.5 million.\nOperating Income and Margin\nOperating income increased $43.9 million, or 29.7%, to $191.8 million for 2016 versus $147.9 million in the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to higher incentive fees of $11.0 million and reduced variable compensation expense relating to the RSU agreement of $57.0 million partially offset by lower non-incentive fee revenues of $39.0 million. Operating margin was 54.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016, versus 38.8% in the prior year period. The increase in operating margin was due primarily to lower variable compensation costs and management fee expense related to the RSU agreement. (see page 34)\nOperating income before management fee was $198.3 million for the year ended of 2016, versus $163.5 million in the prior year. Operating margin before management fee was 56.2% in the 2016 period versus 42.9% in the 2015 period. The reconciliation of operating income before management fee and operating margin before management fee, both of which are non-GAAP measures to their respective GAAP measures, is provided at the end of this section.\nOther Income and Expense\nTotal other income (expense), net of interest expense, was an expense of $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to an expense of $8.9 million in 2015. This is comprised of net gain from investments of $1.6 million in 2016 as compared to $5.0 million in 2015; loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.1 million in 2015; interest and dividend income of $1.5 million in 2016 versus $2.2 million in 2015; interest expense of $12.7 million in 2016 as compared to $8.6 million in 2015 and Shareholder-designated contribution expense of $6.4 million in 2015.\nInterest expense increased $4.1 million to $12.7 million in 2016, from $8.6 million in 2015 primarily related to the higher average amount of debt outstanding in 2016 versus 2015.\nIn 2015, the Board of Directors of GBL again adopted a Shareholder Designated Charitable Contribution program on behalf of all registered Class A and Class B shareholders. Under the programs the Board approved a $0.25 per share contribution, resulting in a charge of $6.4 million in 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate ( ETR\u201d) was 35.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, versus 37.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The ETR for 2016 benefitted by 1.4% due to the reversal of tax accruals related to the closing out of a state audit.\nShareholder Compensation and Initiatives\nDuring 2016, we returned $13.2 million of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We returned to shareholders a total of $0.08 per share in regular quarterly cash dividends in 2016 totaling $2.4 million. During 2015, we returned $34.7 million of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We returned to shareholders a total of $0.28 per share in regular quarterly cash dividends totaling $7.5 million.\nThrough our stock buyback program, we repurchased 348,687 and 426,628 shares in 2016 and 2015, respectively, for approximately $10.8 million and $27.2 million, or $30.88 and $63.85 per share, respectively (For 2015, 413,228 shares were at an average investment of $64.86 per share prior to the distribution of AC on November 30, 2015 and 13,400 shares were at an average price of $32.56 following the distribution of AC). Approximately 233,000 shares remain authorized under our stock buyback program at December 31, 2016. Since our IPO we have repurchased 9,901,340 shares for a total investment of $438.8 million, or $44.32 per share.\nWeighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in 2016 and 2015 were 30.2 million and 25.7 million, respectively.\nOperating income before management fee expense is used by management for purposes of evaluating its business operations. We believe this measure is useful in illustrating the operating results of the Company as management fee expense is based on pre-tax income before management fee expense, which includes non-operating items including investment gains and losses from the Company's proprietary investment portfolio and interest expense. We believe that an investor would find this useful in analyzing the business operations of the Company without the impact of the non-operating items such as trading and investment portfolios or interest expense.\nReconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP:\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 353,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 380,976\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 191,796\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 147,949\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add back: management fee expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,518\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,503\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income before management fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 198,314\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,452\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 54.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 38.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating margin before management fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 56.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 42.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues\nTotal revenues were $381.0 million in 2015, $40.9 million or 9.7% lower than the total revenues of $421.9 million in 2014.

Average equity AUM fell 7.3% to $41.6 billion in 2015 from $44.9 billion in 2014, primarily from net outflows. Incentive fees, which comprised 1.2% of total revenues in 2015, result from our ability to either generate an absolute return in a portfolio or meet or exceed a specific benchmark index or indices and can vary significantly from one period to another. Incentive fees were lower in 2015 as fewer portfolios exceeded their respective benchmarks.\nFund revenues decreased $23.9 million or 10.1%, to $214.2 million, driven by lower average AUM. Revenue from open-end funds decreased $19.0 million, or 11.1%, from the prior year as average AUM in 2015 decreased $2.0 billion, or 10.3%, to $17.4 billion from the $19.4 billion in 2014. Closed-end fund revenues decreased $5.0 million, or 7.4%, to $62.3 million from the prior year and was comprised of a decline of $3.4 million in incentive fees on certain closed-end fund AUM and a decrease of $1.6 million in investment advisory fees attributable to lower average AUM. Revenue from Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts, excluding incentive fees, which are generally billed on beginning quarter AUM, decreased $6.1 million, or 5.0%, principally due to lower billable AUM levels throughout the course of 2015. Incentive fees earned on certain accounts declined by $1.1 million. In 2015, average AUM in our equity Institutional and Private Wealth Management business decreased $1.3 billion, or 6.3%, for the year to $18.9 billion.\nDistribution Fees and Other Income: Distribution fees and other income decreased $10.4 million, or 16.9%, to $51.0 million in 2015 from $61.4 million in 2014. Lower distribution fees of $47.7 million in 2015 versus $56.1 million for the prior year, principally as a result of decreased average AUM in our open-end equity mutual funds of 10.7% and a decrease of $2.0 million in fees from the sale of load shares of mutual funds and other income contributed to this decrease.\nExpenses\nCompensation: Total compensation costs, which are largely variable in nature, decreased $14.8 million, or 9.8%, to $136.5 million in 2015 from $151.3 million in 2014. Variable compensation costs, principally portfolio manager and relationship manager fees, decreased $11.6 million to $110.2 million in 2015 from $121.8 million in 2014 and remained steady as a percent of revenues at 28.9% in both 2015 and 2014. Variable compensation is driven by revenue levels which decreased in 2015 from 2014. Fixed compensation costs decreased to $26.3 million in 2015 from $29.5 million in 2014.\nStock based compensation: Stock based compensation was $9.9 million in 2015, an increase of $4.6 million, as compared to $5.3 million in 2014. The increase primarily results from the acceleration of 130,650 RSAs during 2015 for an additional expense of $3.5 million that would have been recognized in future years.\nManagement Fee: In 2015 management fee expense decreased to $15.5 million versus $18.7 million in 2014. Management fee expense is incentive-based and entirely variable in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits which is paid to Mr. Gabelli (or his designee) in accordance with his employment agreement.\nDistribution Costs: Distribution costs, which include marketing, promotion and distribution costs decreased $7.7 million, or 12.9%, to $52.0 million in 2015 from $59.7 million in 2014 driven by a decrease in average open-end equity mutual funds AUM of 10.7%.\nOther Operating Expenses: Our other operating expenses were $19.2 million in 2015 compared to $17.5 million in 2014, an increase of $1.7 million or 9.7%. The year over year increase was attributable to recovery of legal expense in 2014 related to prior years of $1.3 million. The remainder of $0.4 million increase was spread among multiple categories of expense.\nOperating Income and Margin\nOperating income decreased $21.6 million, or 12.7%, to $147.9 million for 2015 versus $169.5 million in the prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to the declines in revenues which were largely attributable to the lower levels of average AUM in 2015 versus 2014. Operating margin was 38.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015, versus 40.2% in the prior year period. The decline in operating margin was due to increased fixed costs as a percentage of revenues partially offset by lower management fee expense.\nOperating income before management fee was $163.5 million for the year ended of 2015, versus $188.1 million in the prior year. Operating margin before management fee was 42.9% in the 2015 period versus 44.6% in the 2014 period.

Under the program the Board approved a $0.25 per share contribution, resulting in a charge of $6.4 million in 2015. During 2013, the Board had approved a $0.25 per share contribution that was not finalized as to which shareholders would participate until 2014. As a result there was $0.1 million of expense recorded in 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate ( ETR\u201d) was 37.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015, versus 36.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nShareholder Compensation and Initiatives\nDuring 2015, we returned $34.7 million of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases.

Notwithstanding its ability to settle the RSU agreement in stock, GAMCO currently intends to make a cash payment to Mr. Gabelli on the Lapse Date in an amount, under the terms of the agreement, equal to the number of RSUs valued at the lesser of the VWAP of the Company's Class A Stock for the 2016 fiscal year or the value on the Lapse Date or, if not a trading day, then the first trading date thereafter. The Board's decision to grant these RSUs and thereby defer the cash payment of his 2016 variable compensation until January 1, 2020 was to provide the Company with greater financial flexibility. While the issuance of the award itself does not change Mr. Gabelli's compensation, the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d) reporting for his compensation has changed. The 2016 results were materially bolstered by the GAAP-mandated treatment of these RSUs. Margins for 2016 therefore are not comparable with prior periods.\nUnder GAAP, only 25% of this deferred compensation expense is being recognized in the current year with the remainder amortized ratably over 2017, 2018, and 2019. Expressed another way, 2016 benefitted from a reduction of 75% of the compensation, and 2017, 2018, and 2019 will, in turn, be impacted by an additional 25% of the compensation from 2016 in each year.\nThe balance sheet is also impacted; the compensation payable at December 31, 2016 is only 25% of the full amount of the 2016 compensation that will be due once the RSUs are fully vested. At December 31, 2016, the amount of unrecognized compensation was $53.5 million.\nThe following tables show a reconciliation of our results for 2016, and our balance sheet at December 31, 2016 between the GAAP basis and a non-GAAP adjusted basis of the deferred compensation (the RSU grant) as if all of the expense was recognized in 2016. We believe this adjusted measure is useful in evaluating the ongoing operating results of the Company absent the material adjustment related to the treatment of the deferred compensation agreement.\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Full Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Impact

The shelf is available through April 2018, at which time it may be renewed.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $39.8 million, an increase of $26.1 million from the prior year-end primarily due to the Company's operating activities described below. Total face value debt outstanding at December 31, 2016 was $234.2 million, consisting of $100 million of a 4% PIK Note due November 30, 2020, $110 million of a 4.5% Convertible note due August 15, 2021 and $24.2 million of 5.875% senior notes due 2021. It is anticipated that the majority of our cash flow will go towards servicing our debt for the next few years.\nCash provided by operating activities was $115.7 million in 2016 and $117.1 million in 2015. Our largest source of cash comes from net earnings as adjusted for non-cash expenses. In 2016, this totaled $117.1 million versus $87.3 million in 2015. Other sources of cash included an increase in compensation payable of $24.3 million, and an increase in income taxes payable of $13.2 million. Cash uses included an increase of recievables from affiliates of $22.3 million, an increase in investment advisory fees receivable of $19.4 million, reductions of $13.6 million as a result of a decrease in payable to affiliates, reductions in stock based compensation expense of $5.9, a reduction in deferred income taxes of $6.7 million and $0.8 million from other changes in net assets and liabilities. In 2015, cash was provided by net income of $87.3 million, a reduction of assets of $24.6 million and decreases in payable to affiliates, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $8.4 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $1.4 million in 2016 is due to purchases of available for sale securities of $1.8 million less $0.4 million in proceeds from sales of available for sale securities. Net cash used in investing activities of $6.2 million in 2015 is due to purchases of available for sale securities of $6.3 million less $0.1 million in proceeds from sales of available for sale securities.\nNet cash used in financing activities of $88.2 million in 2016 principally resulted from $150 million in repayments of our AC 4% PIK Note due November 30, 2020 , $35 million repayment of the loan from GGCP, $10.8 million of repurchases of our Class A Stock under the Stock Repurchase Program, and $2.3 million in dividends paid offset by the issuance of the 4.5% Convertible Note due August 15, 2021 of $109.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities of $109.9 million in 2015 principally resulted from $76.5 million in repurchases of our 5.875% Senior Notes due June 1, 2021 resulting from the tender offer for those notes in December 2015, $21.7 million in net cash transferred to AC, $27.2 million of repurchases of our Class A Stock under the Stock Repurchase Program, $13.1 million in redemptions of our zero coupon subordinated debentures and $7.5 million in dividends paid partially offset by $35.0 million in borrowings from GGCP and $1.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nUnder the terms of the lease of our Rye, New York office, we are obligated to make minimum total payments of $13.1 million through December 2028.\nOn November 25, 2015, Moody's Investors Services downgraded the Company to Ba1 from Baa3. We continue to maintain an investment grade rating with Standard and Poor's Ratings Services. We believe that our ability to maintain our investment grade rating will provide greater access to the capital markets, enhance liquidity and lower overall borrowing costs.\nG.distributors is registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer and is regulated by FINRA. As such, it is subject to the minimum net capital requirements promulgated by the SEC. G.distributors' net capital exceeded these minimum requirements at December 31, 2016. G.distributors computes its net capital under the alternative method permitted by the SEC, which requires minimum net capital of the greater of $250,000 or 2% of the aggregate debit items in the reserve formula for those broker-dealers subject to Rule 15c3-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, G.distributors had net capital, as defined, of approximately $2.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively, exceeding the regulatory requirement by approximately $2.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Net capital requirements for our affiliated broker-dealer may increase in accordance with rules and regulations to the extent they engage in other business activities.\nOur subsidiary, GAMCO Asset Management (UK) Limited is authorized and regulated by the FCA. In February 2011, GAMCO Asset Management (UK) Limited increased its permitted license with the FCA's predecessor, the Financial Services Authority ( FSA\u201d) and has held Total Capital of \u00a3580,000 and \u00a3519,000 ($713,000 and $769,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively) and had a Financial Resources Requirement of \u00a3265,000 and \u00a3262,000 ($326,000 and $388,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively). We have consistently met or exceeded these minimum requirements.\nMarket Risk\nOur primary market risk exposure is to changes in equity prices and interest rates. Since approximately 95% of our AUM are equities, our financial results are subject to equity-market risk as revenues from our investment management services are sensitive to stock market dynamics. In addition, returns from our proprietary investment portfolio are exposed to interest rate and equity market risk.\nThe Company's Chief Investment Officer oversees the proprietary investment portfolios and allocations of proprietary capital among the various strategies. The Chief Investment Officer and the Board of Directors review the proprietary investment portfolios throughout the year. Additionally, the Company monitors its proprietary investment portfolios to ensure that they are in compliance with the Company's guidelines.\nEquity Price Risk\nThe Company earns substantially all of its revenue as advisory and distribution fees from our affiliated open-end and closed-end funds, Institutional and Private Wealth Management, and Investment Partnership assets. Such fees represent a percentage of AUM, and the majority of these assets are in equity investments. Accordingly, since revenues are proportionate to the value of those investments, a substantial increase or decrease in equity markets overall will have a corresponding effect on the Company's revenues.\nWith respect to our proprietary investment activities, included in investments in securities of $37.3 million and $33.0 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were investments in common stocks totaling $37.2 million and $33.0 million, respectively, and closed-end funds of $0.1 million and $0.0 million, respectively. Of the $37.2 million and $33.0 million, invested in common stocks at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, $37.1 million and $32.6 million, respectively, was related to our investment in Westwood Holdings Group Inc. (NYSE: WHG). Securities sold, not yet purchased are financial instruments purchased under agreements to resell and financial instruments sold under agreement to repurchase. These financial instruments are stated at fair value and are subject to market risks resulting from changes in price and volatility. At December 31, 2016 there were no securities sold, not yet purchased. At December 31, 2015, the fair value of securities sold, not yet purchased was $0.1 million.\nThe following table provides a sensitivity analysis for our investments in equity securities as of December 31, 2016. The sensitivity analysis assumes a 10% increase or decrease in the value of these investments (in thousands):\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> assuming\n</td> <td> </td> <td> assuming\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10% decrease in\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 10% increase in\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (unaudited)\n</td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> equity prices\n</td> <td> </td> <td> equity prices\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> At December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity price sensitive investments, at fair value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,285\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,557\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> At December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity price sensitive investments, at fair value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,848\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,563\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,133\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment advisory fees for mutual funds and sub-advisory relationships are based on average daily or weekly asset values. Advisory fees earned on Institutional and Private Wealth Management assets, for any given quarter, are generally determined based on asset values at the beginning of a quarter with any significant increases or decreases in market value of assets managed which occur during a quarter resulting in a relative increase or decrease in revenues for the following quarter.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk results, principally, from our investment of excess cash in a money market fund that holds U.S. Government securities. These investments are primarily short term in nature, and the carrying value of these investments generally approximates fair value. Based on December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalent balance of $39.8 million a 1% increase in interest rates would increase our interest income by $0.4 million annually. Given that our current annualized return on these investments is close to 0.37%, an analysis of a 1% decrease is not meaningful.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and capital and operating lease agreements. The following table sets forth our significant contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 5.875% Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,225\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,225\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on 5.875% Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,285\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,423\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,423\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,423\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,423\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AC 4% PIK Note\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on AC 4% PIK Note\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,066\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,967\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,533\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,733\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,833\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4.5% Convertible note\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 110,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 110,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on 4.5% Convertible note\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22,894\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,950\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,950\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,950\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,950\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,094\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,091\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,211\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,560\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cancelable operating </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,642\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 290,203\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,256\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,475\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,543\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,329\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 139,036\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,564\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe AC 4% PIK Note interest may be paid in kind with additional notes on the same terms as the original note at the Company's option. See Note F Debt for additional details.\nThe capital lease contains an escalation clause tied to the change in the New York Metropolitan Area Consumer Price Index which may cause the future minimum payments to exceed $1,080,000 annually. Any increases to the base rental will be accounted for prospectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not invest in any other off-balance sheet vehicles that provide financing, liquidity, market or credit risk support or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn the ordinary course of business, we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on historical experience, when available, and on other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nWe believe the critical assumptions and estimates are those applied to revenue recognition, the accounting for and valuation of investments in securities, income taxes, and stock based compensation accounting.\nMajor Revenue-Generating Services and Revenue Recognition\nThe Company's revenues are derived primarily from investment advisory and incentive fees, institutional research services and distribution fees.\nInvestment advisory and incentive fees are directly influenced by the level and mix of AUM as fees are derived from a contractually-determined percentage of AUM for each account as well as incentive fees earned on certain accounts. Advisory fees from the open-end funds, closed-end funds and sub-advisory accounts are computed daily or weekly based on average net assets and amounts receivable are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Advisory fees from Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts are generally computed quarterly based on account values as of the end of the preceding quarter, and amounts receivable are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company derived approximately 87%, 87% and 85% of its total revenues from advisory and management fees, including incentive fees, for the periods ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These revenues vary depending upon the level of sales compared with redemptions, financial market conditions, performance and the fee structure for AUM. Revenues derived from the equity-oriented portfolios generally have higher management fee rates than fixed income portfolios.\nThe Company earns incentive fees from certain Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts, which are based upon meeting or exceeding a specific benchmark index or indices. Incentive fees refer to fees earned when the return generated for the client exceeds the benchmark and can be earned even if the return to the client is negative as long as the return exceeds the benchmark. These fees are recognized, for each respective account, at the end of the stipulated contract period which is either quarterly or annually and varies by account. Receivables due for incentive fees earned are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. There were $2.4 million in incentive fees receivable as of December 31, 2016. There were no incentive fees receivable as of December 31, 2015. Management fees on a majority of the closed-end preferred shares are earned at year-end if the total return to common shareholders of the closed-end fund for the calendar year exceeds the dividend rate of the preferred shares. These fees are recognized at the end of the measurement period, which is annually. Receivables due for management fees on closed-end preferred shares are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. There were $7.3 million in management fees receivable on closed-end preferred shares as of December 31, 2016. There were no management fees receivable on closed-end preferred shares as of December 31, 2015. For The GDL Fund, there is an incentive fee earned as of the end of the calendar year and varies to the extent the total return of the fund is in excess of the 90 day T-Bill Index total return. This fee is recognized at the end of the measurement period, which is annually on a calendar year basis. Receivables due on incentive fees relating to The GDL Fund are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition and were $4.2 million and $3.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDistribution fees revenues are derived primarily from the distribution of Gabelli, GAMCO, Comstock and Teton open-end funds ( Funds\u201d) advised by a subsidiary of GBL, Funds Advisor and a subsidiary of GGCP, Teton. G.distributors distributes these open-end Funds pursuant to distribution agreements with each Fund. Under each distribution agreement with an open-end Fund, G.distributors offers and sells such open-end Fund shares on a continuous basis and pays all of the costs of marketing and selling the shares, including printing and mailing prospectuses and sales literature, advertising and maintaining sales and customer service personnel and sales and services fulfillment systems, and payments to the sponsors of third party distribution programs, financial intermediaries and G.distributors' sales personnel. G.distributors receives fees for such services pursuant to distribution plans adopted under provisions of Rule 12b-1 of the Company Act. G.distributors is the principal underwriter for funds distributed in multiple classes of shares which carry front-end or back-end sales charge or no-load to certain investors.\nUnder the distribution plans, the open-end Class AAA shares of the Funds (except The Gabelli U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund, Gabelli Capital Asset Fund and The Gabelli ABC Fund) and the Class A shares of certain Funds pay G.distributors a distribution or service fee of .25% per year (except the Class A shares of the Westwood Funds which pay .50% per year, except for the TETON Westwood Intermediate Bond Fund which pays .35%, and the Class A shares of the Gabelli Enterprise Mergers and Acquisitions Fund which pay .45% per year) on the average daily net assets of the fund. Class B and Class C shares have a 12b-1 distribution plan with a service and distribution fee totaling 1%. Class B shares were discontinued in 2014.\nDistribution fees from the open-end funds are computed daily based on average net assets. The amounts receivable for distribution fees are included in receivables from affiliates on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nFinally, GBL also has investment gains or losses generated from its proprietary trading activities which are included in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income.\nInvestments in Securities\nInvestments in securities are accounted for as either trading securities\u201d or available for sale\u201d and are stated at fair value. Management determines the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. U.S. Treasury Bills and Notes with maturities of greater than three months at the time of purchase are considered investments in securities. Securities that are not readily marketable are stated at their estimated fair values in accordance with GAAP. A substantial portion of investments in securities are held for resale in anticipation of short-term market movements and therefore are classified as trading securities. Trading securities are stated at fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses reported in current period earnings in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income. AFS investments are stated at fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of other comprehensive income except for losses deemed to be other than temporary which are recorded as realized losses on the consolidated statements of income. Securities transactions and any related gains and losses are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and losses from securities transactions are recorded on the specific identified cost basis and are included in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income.\nAFS securities are evaluated for other than temporary impairment each reporting period and any impairment charges are recorded in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income. Management reviews all available for sale securities whose cost exceeds their fair value to determine if the impairment is other than temporary. Management uses qualitative factors such as diversification of the investment, the intent to hold the investment, the amount of time that the investment has been impaired and the severity of the decline in determining whether the impairment is other than temporary.\nSecurities sold, but not yet purchased are recorded on the trade date, and are stated at fair value and represent obligations of GBL to purchase the securities at prevailing market prices. Therefore, the future satisfaction of such obligations may be for an amount greater or less than the amounts recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate gains or losses recognized are dependent upon the prices at which these securities are purchased to settle the obligations under the sales commitments. Realized gains and losses from covers of securities sold, not yet purchased transactions are included in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income. Securities sold, not yet purchased are stated at fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses reported in current period earnings in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. For each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions and penalties in income tax provision on the consolidated statements of income.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company has granted RSAs and stock options to staff members which were recommended by the Company's Chairman, who did not receive an RSA or option award, and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. We use a fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation provided to our employees. The estimated fair value of RSAs is determined by using the closing price of our Class A Stock on the day prior to the grant date. The total expense, which is reduced by estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the vesting period for these awards which is either (1) 30% over three years from the date of grant and 70% over five years from the date of grant or (2) 30% over three years from the date of grant and 10% each year over years four through ten from the date of grant. The forfeiture rate is determined by reviewing historical forfeiture rates for previous stock-based compensation grants and is reviewed and updated quarterly, if necessary. During the vesting period, dividends to RSA holders are held for them until the RSA vesting dates and are forfeited if the grantee is no longer employed by the Company on the vesting dates. Dividends declared on these RSAs, less estimated forfeitures, are charged to retained earnings on the declaration date. During 2015, the Board of Directors accelerated the lapsing of restrictions on the November 2013 grant of RSAs.\nThe estimated fair value of option awards is determined using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. This sophisticated model utilizes a number of assumptions in arriving at its results, including the estimated life of the option, the risk free interest rate at the date of grant and the volatility of the underlying common stock. There may be other factors, which have not been considered, which may have an effect on the value of the options as well. The effects of changing any of the assumptions or factors employed by the Black Scholes model may result in a significantly different valuation for the options. The total expense, which is reduced by estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the vesting period for these awards which is 75% over three years from the date of grant and 25% after four years from date of grant. The forfeiture rate is determined by reviewing historical forfeiture rates for previous stock-based compensation grants and is reviewed and updated quarterly, if necessary.\nIn connection with the spin-off of AC, the unvested RSA expense relating to the existing GBL RSAs at November 30, 2015 was split between GBL and AC based on the allocation of time of the underlying employees who held the RSAs.\nThe Company has entered into a deferred compensation agreement with Mr. Gabelli whereby his variable compensation for 2016 was in the form of Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs\u201d) determined by the volume-weighted average price ( VWAP\u201d) of the Company's Class A Stock during 2016. The RSUs will vest 100% on January 1, 2020, and the Company intends to settle the award in cash at that time; however, the Company reserves the right to issue shares of the Company's Class A Stock in lieu of such cash payment. Under the terms of the agreement the Company will pay Mr. Gabelli an amount equal to the number of RSUs valued at the lesser of the VWAP of the Company's Class A Stock for the 2016 fiscal year or the value on the lapse date or, if not a trading day, then the first trading date thereafter. Under GAAP, only 25% of this deferred compensation expense is being recognized in 2016 with the remainder amortized ratably over 2017, 2018, and 2019. Notwithstanding its ability to settle the award in stock, given the Company's intent to settle it in cash, in accordance with GAAP (ASC 718), the award is accounted for as a liability-classified award and not as an equity-classified award. The liability is remeasured at fair value on each reporting period from December 31, 2016 until the vesting date. However, given the cap on the obligation in that Mr. Gabelli will not receive cash in excess of the VWAP of the Company's Class A Stock for the 2016 fiscal year, the remeasurement of the liability at fair value will never exceed its value determined using that VWAP price.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nSee Footnote A. Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Developments.\nSeasonality and Inflation\nWe do not believe our operations are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We do not believe inflation will significantly affect our compensation costs, as they are substantially variable in nature. However, the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as information technology and occupancy costs. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations by reducing our AUM, revenues or otherwise.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 to this report.\nIntroduction\nOn November 30, 2015 (the Spin-Off Date\u201d), GBL distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of Associated Capital Group, Inc. ( AC\u201d) and its subsidiaries along with certain cash and other assets (the Spin-off\u201d). AC owns and operates, directly or indirectly, the alternatives and the institutional research businesses previously owned and operated by GBL. In the Spin-off, each holder of GAMCO's Class A Common Stock ( Class A Stock\u201d) of record as of 5:00 p.m. New York City time on November 12, 2015 (the Record Date\u201d), received one share of AC Class A common stock for each share of GAMCO Class A Stock held on the Record Date. Each record holder of GAMCO's Class B Stock received one share of AC Class B common stock for each share of GAMCO Class B Stock held on the Record Date. Subsequent to the Spin-off, GAMCO no longer consolidates the financial results of AC for the purposes of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of AC have been reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the Spin-off Date. Historical AUM have similarly been adjusted to remove AUM managed by AC.\nOur revenues are highly correlated to the level of AUM and fees associated with our various investment products, rather than our own corporate assets. AUM, which are directly influenced by the level and changes of the overall equity markets, can also fluctuate through acquisitions, the creation of new products, the addition of new accounts or the loss of existing accounts. Since various equity products have different fees, changes in our business mix may also affect revenues. At times, the performance of our equity products may differ markedly from popular market indices, and this can also impact our revenues. It is our belief that general stock market trends will have the greatest impact on our level of AUM and hence, revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $39.7 billion of AUM. We conduct our investment advisory business principally through: GAMCO (Institutional and Private Wealth Management), and Funds Advisor (Funds). We also are a distributor of our open-end funds through our broker-dealer subsidiary G.distributors.\nOrganizational Chart\nSubsequent to the Spin-off, this is the current organizational chart of the Company.\n2016 Business and Investment Highlights\n \u00b7 On December 1, 2016, the Company launched Gabelli Media Mogul (NYSE: MOGLC), its first in a series of actively managed, non-transparent exchange traded managed funds ( ETMFs\u201d). Gabelli Media Mogul will invest primarily in the media industry; specifically in companies that were spun-off from Dr. John Malone's Liberty Media Corporation ( Liberty Media\u201d) as constituted in 2001, including companies formed through subsequent mergers of those spin-offs and companies in which Liberty Media and its successors have invested. \n \u00b7 On October 4, 2016, the Company announced that Katrina O'Leary joined GAMCO's institutional team as Vice President, head of Consultant Relations. Ms. O'Leary will launch a dedicated effort to develop the firm's relationships with the global consulting community. The role underscores GAMCO's commitment to delivering superior risk adjusted returns and providing best in class client service in a rapidly changing investment environment. \n \u00b7 On August 15, 2016, the Company issued a $110 million five year convertible note to Cascade Investment, L.L.C. in a private transaction. The note has a coupon of 4.5% and is convertible into GBL Class A common stock at $55 per share. \n \u00b7 On September 2, 2016, GAMCO completed the initial public offering of The Gabelli Go Anywhere Trust, the Company's 15th closed-end fund. This newly organized closed-end fund initially traded on the NYSE MKT as a $100 combination consisting of one preferred share at $40 and three common shares at $19 each under the symbol GGO.C. This innovative offering demonstrates the flexibility of the closed-end fund structure. Separate trading on the NYSE MKT for the common shares ( GGO\u201d) and the Series A Preferred shares ( GGO.A\u201d) commenced on November 2, 2016. \n \u00b7 2016 was the first full year of advising the Bancroft Fund, and Ellsworth Growth and Income Fund. The Dinsmore team now manages over $350 million in AUM across three closed-end funds. 2016 was also the first full year of advising The Gabelli Value Plus+ Trust, our first London Stock Exchange listed closed-end fund. The Fund had $171 million of AUM at December 31, 2016. \n \u00b7 Net debt improved from $262.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $156.9 million at December 31, 2016. \nOverview\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nInvestment advisory and incentive fees, which are based on the amount and composition of AUM in our Funds, Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts, represent our largest source of revenues. In addition to the general level and trends of the stock market, growth in revenues depends on good investment performance, which influences the value of existing AUM as well as contributes to higher investment and lower redemption rates and facilitates the ability to attract additional investors while maintaining current fee levels. Growth in AUM is also dependent on being able to access various distribution channels, which is usually based on several factors, including performance and service. A majority of our cash inflows to mutual fund products have come through third party distribution programs, including NTF programs. We have also been engaged to act as a sub-advisor for other much larger financial services companies with much larger sales distribution organizations. These sub-advisory clients are subject to business combinations that may result in the termination of the relationship. The loss of a sub-advisory relationship could have a significant impact on our financial results in the future.\nAdvisory fees from the open-end funds, closed-end funds and sub-advisory accounts are computed daily or weekly based on average net assets. Advisory fees from Institutional and Private Wealth Management clients are generally computed quarterly based on account values as of the end of the preceding quarter. These revenues are based on AUM which is highly correlated to the stock market and can vary in direct proportion to movements in the stock market and the level of sales compared with redemptions, financial market conditions and the fee structure for AUM. Revenues derived from the equity-oriented portfolios generally have higher management fee rates than fixed income portfolios.\nWe also receive incentive fees from certain Institutional and Private Wealth Management clients, which are based upon meeting or exceeding a specific benchmark index or indices. These fees are recognized at the end of the stipulated contract period, which may be quarterly or annually, for the respective account. Management fees on assets attributable to a majority of the closed-end preferred shares are earned at year-end if the total return to common shareholders of the closed-end fund for the calendar year exceeds the dividend rate of the preferred shares. These fees are recognized at the end of the measurement period.\nDistribution fees and other income primarily include distribution fee revenue earned in accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the Company Act, as amended, along with sales charges and underwriting fees associated with the sale of the mutual funds plus other revenues. Distribution fees fluctuate based on the level of AUM and the amount and type of mutual funds sold directly by G.distributors or through various distribution channels.\nCompensation costs include variable and fixed compensation and related expenses paid to officers, portfolio managers, sales, trading, research and all other professional staff. Variable compensation paid to sales personnel and portfolio management generally represents 40% of revenues and is the largest component of total compensation costs. Distribution costs include marketing, product distribution and promotion costs. Management fee is incentive-based and entirely variable compensation in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits which is paid to Mr. Gabelli or his designee for acting as CEO pursuant to his 2008 Employment Agreement so long as he is an executive of GBL and devotes the substantial majority of his working time to the business. Other operating expenses include general and administrative operating costs.\nOther income and expenses include net gains and losses from investments (which includes both realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading securities), interest and dividend income, and interest expense. Net gains and losses from investments are derived from our proprietary investment portfolio consisting of various public and private investments.\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the share of net income attributable to the minority stockholders, as reported on a separate company basis, of our consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries and net income attributable to third party limited partners of certain partnerships and offshore funds we consolidate. Please refer to Note A in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nIncome/(loss) on discontinued operations, net of taxes represents the results of the businesses and assets that were part of the Spin-off of AC. Please refer to Note P in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition\nWe ended the 2016 year with approximately $77.1 million in cash and investments. The $77.1 million consists of $39.8 million cash and cash equivalents, primarily invested in our 100% U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund, $0.1 million invested in common stocks and available for sale ( AFS\u201d) securities of $37.2 million. Of the $37.2 million of AFS securities, $37.1 million represent our investment in shares of Westwood Holdings Group.\nThe face value of our debt consisted of $100 million of a 4% PIK Note due to AC, $110 million of a 4.5% convertible note due August 15, 2021 and $24.2 million of 5.875% senior notes due June 1, 2021.\nEquity was a negative $166.6 million on December 31, 2016 compared to a negative $276.3 million on December 31, 2015.\nWe filed a shelf registration with the SEC in 2015 which, among other things, provides us the flexibility to sell any combination of senior and subordinate debt securities, convertible debt securities, equity securities (including common and preferred stock), and other securities up to a total amount of $500 million. The shelf is available through April 10, 2018, at which time it may be renewed.\nOur primary short-term goal is to use our liquid resources to pay down our existing debt. As a secondary goal, we will look to opportunistically and strategically grow operating income at what we consider a margin of safety. We will also consider alternatives to return capital to our shareholders including stock repurchases and dividends.\nAssets Under Management Highlights\nWe reported assets under management as follows

Equity AUM were $37.9 billion on December 31, 2016, 2.2% above the $37.1 billion on December 31, 2015. We earn incentive fees for certain institutional client assets, assets attributable to certain preferred issues for our closed-end funds and our GDL Fund (NYSE: GDL). As of December 31, 2016, assets with incentive based fees were $2.5 billion, 7.4% below the $2.7 billion on December 31, 2015. The majority of these assets have calendar year-end measurement periods; therefore, our incentive fees are primarily recognized in the fourth quarter when the uncertainty is removed at the end of the annual measurement period.\nOperating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenues\nTotal revenues were $353.0 million in 2016, $28.0 million or 7.3% lower than the total revenues of $381.0 million in 2015.

Average total AUM declined 10.0% to $38.9 billion in 2016 as compared to $43.2 billion in 2015. Average equity AUM fell 10.6% to $37.2 billion in 2016 from $41.6 billion in 2015, primarily from net outflows. Incentive fees, which comprised 4.4% of total revenues in 2016, result from our ability to either generate an absolute return in a portfolio or meet or exceed a specific benchmark index or indices and can vary significantly from one period to another. Incentive fees were higher in 2016 as a greater number of portfolios exceeded their respective benchmarks as compared to 2015.\nFund revenues decreased $14.9 million or 7.0%, to $199.3 million, driven by lower average AUM. Revenue from open-end funds decreased $21.9 million, or 14.4%, to $130.0 million from the prior year as average AUM in 2016 decreased $2.2 billion, or 12.6%, to $15.2 billion from the $17.4 billion in 2014. Closed-end fund revenues increased $7.0 million, or 11.2%, to $69.3 million from the prior year and was comprised of an increase of $7.8 million in incentive fees on certain closed-end fund AUM partially reduced by a decrease of $0.8 million in investment advisory fees attributable to lower average AUM. Revenue from Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts, excluding incentive fees, which are generally billed on beginning quarter AUM, decreased $11.7 million, or 10.3%, principally due to lower billable AUM levels throughout the course of 2016. Incentive fees earned on certain accounts increased by $1.7 million. In 2016, average AUM in our equity Institutional and Private Wealth Management business decreased $2.1 billion, or 11.1%, for the year to $16.8 billion.\nDistribution Fees and Other Income: Distribution fees and other income decreased $6.5 million, or 12.7%, to $44.5 million in 2016 from $51.0 million in 2015. Lower distribution fees of $41.0 million in 2016 versus $47.7 million for the prior year, principally as a result of decreased average AUM in our open-end equity mutual funds of 13.7%, offset by an increase of $0.2 million in fees from the sale of load shares of mutual funds and other income, contributed to this decrease.\nExpenses\nCompensation: Total compensation costs, which are largely variable in nature, decreased $53.9 million, or 39.5%, to $82.6 million in 2016 from $136.5 million in 2015. Variable compensation costs, principally portfolio manager and relationship manager fees, decreased $53.6 million to $56.6 million in 2016 from $110.2 million in 2015 and decreased as a percent of revenues to 16.0% in 2016 from 28.9% in 2015. The principle reason was the December 2015 Restricted Stock Units ( RSU\u201d) agreement with Mr. Gabelli which reduced variable compensation by $44.6 million in 2016. (see page 34) Variable compensation is also driven by revenue levels which decreased in 2016 from 2015. Fixed compensation costs decreased slightly to $26.0 million in 2016 from $26.3 million in 2015.\nStock based compensation: Stock based compensation was $4.0 million in 2016, a decrease of $5.9 million, as compared to $9.9 million in 2015. The decrease primarily results from the acceleration of 130,650 RSAs during 2015 for an additional expense of $3.5 million that would have been recognized in future years.\nManagement Fee: In 2016 management fee expense decreased to $6.5 million versus $15.5 million in 2015. Management fee expense is incentive-based and entirely variable in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits which is paid to Mr. Gabelli (or his designee) in accordance with his employment agreement. Most importantly the December 2015 RSU agreement reduced the management fee by $12.4 million in 2016. (see page 34)\nDistribution Costs: Distribution costs, which include marketing, promotion and distribution costs decreased $7.8 million, or 15.0%, to $44.2 million in 2016 from $52.0 million in 2015 driven by a decrease in average open-end equity mutual funds AUM of 13.7%.\nOther Operating Expenses: Our other operating expenses were $23.9 million in 2016 compared to $19.2 million in 2015, an increase of $4.7 million or 24.4%. The largest components of this increase were additional donated securities expense of $1.6 million and an increase to the research services fee of $1.5 million.\nOperating Income and Margin\nOperating income increased $43.9 million, or 29.7%, to $191.8 million for 2016 versus $147.9 million in the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to higher incentive fees of $11.0 million and reduced variable compensation expense relating to the RSU agreement of $57.0 million partially offset by lower non-incentive fee revenues of $39.0 million. Operating margin was 54.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016, versus 38.8% in the prior year period. The increase in operating margin was due primarily to lower variable compensation costs and management fee expense related to the RSU agreement. (see page 34)\nOperating income before management fee was $198.3 million for the year ended of 2016, versus $163.5 million in the prior year. Operating margin before management fee was 56.2% in the 2016 period versus 42.9% in the 2015 period. The reconciliation of operating income before management fee and operating margin before management fee, both of which are non-GAAP measures to their respective GAAP measures, is provided at the end of this section.\nOther Income and Expense\nTotal other income (expense), net of interest expense, was an expense of $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to an expense of $8.9 million in 2015. This is comprised of net gain from investments of $1.6 million in 2016 as compared to $5.0 million in 2015; loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.1 million in 2015; interest and dividend income of $1.5 million in 2016 versus $2.2 million in 2015; interest expense of $12.7 million in 2016 as compared to $8.6 million in 2015 and Shareholder-designated contribution expense of $6.4 million in 2015.\nInterest expense increased $4.1 million to $12.7 million in 2016, from $8.6 million in 2015 primarily related to the higher average amount of debt outstanding in 2016 versus 2015.\nIn 2015, the Board of Directors of GBL again adopted a Shareholder Designated Charitable Contribution program on behalf of all registered Class A and Class B shareholders. Under the programs the Board approved a $0.25 per share contribution, resulting in a charge of $6.4 million in 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate ( ETR\u201d) was 35.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, versus 37.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The ETR for 2016 benefitted by 1.4% due to the reversal of tax accruals related to the closing out of a state audit.\nShareholder Compensation and Initiatives\nDuring 2016, we returned $13.2 million of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We returned to shareholders a total of $0.08 per share in regular quarterly cash dividends in 2016 totaling $2.4 million. During 2015, we returned $34.7 million of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We returned to shareholders a total of $0.28 per share in regular quarterly cash dividends totaling $7.5 million.\nThrough our stock buyback program, we repurchased 348,687 and 426,628 shares in 2016 and 2015, respectively, for approximately $10.8 million and $27.2 million, or $30.88 and $63.85 per share, respectively (For 2015, 413,228 shares were at an average investment of $64.86 per share prior to the distribution of AC on November 30, 2015 and 13,400 shares were at an average price of $32.56 following the distribution of AC). Approximately 233,000 shares remain authorized under our stock buyback program at December 31, 2016. Since our IPO we have repurchased 9,901,340 shares for a total investment of $438.8 million, or $44.32 per share.\nWeighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in 2016 and 2015 were 30.2 million and 25.7 million, respectively.\nOperating income before management fee expense is used by management for purposes of evaluating its business operations. We believe this measure is useful in illustrating the operating results of the Company as management fee expense is based on pre-tax income before management fee expense, which includes non-operating items including investment gains and losses from the Company's proprietary investment portfolio and interest expense. We believe that an investor would find this useful in analyzing the business operations of the Company without the impact of the non-operating items such as trading and investment portfolios or interest expense.\nReconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP:\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 353,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 380,976\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 191,796\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 147,949\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add back: management fee expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,518\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,503\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income before management fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 198,314\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,452\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 54.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 38.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating margin before management fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 56.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 42.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues\nTotal revenues were $381.0 million in 2015, $40.9 million or 9.7% lower than the total revenues of $421.9 million in 2014.

Average equity AUM fell 7.3% to $41.6 billion in 2015 from $44.9 billion in 2014, primarily from net outflows. Incentive fees, which comprised 1.2% of total revenues in 2015, result from our ability to either generate an absolute return in a portfolio or meet or exceed a specific benchmark index or indices and can vary significantly from one period to another. Incentive fees were lower in 2015 as fewer portfolios exceeded their respective benchmarks.\nFund revenues decreased $23.9 million or 10.1%, to $214.2 million, driven by lower average AUM. Revenue from open-end funds decreased $19.0 million, or 11.1%, from the prior year as average AUM in 2015 decreased $2.0 billion, or 10.3%, to $17.4 billion from the $19.4 billion in 2014. Closed-end fund revenues decreased $5.0 million, or 7.4%, to $62.3 million from the prior year and was comprised of a decline of $3.4 million in incentive fees on certain closed-end fund AUM and a decrease of $1.6 million in investment advisory fees attributable to lower average AUM. Revenue from Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts, excluding incentive fees, which are generally billed on beginning quarter AUM, decreased $6.1 million, or 5.0%, principally due to lower billable AUM levels throughout the course of 2015. Incentive fees earned on certain accounts declined by $1.1 million. In 2015, average AUM in our equity Institutional and Private Wealth Management business decreased $1.3 billion, or 6.3%, for the year to $18.9 billion.\nDistribution Fees and Other Income: Distribution fees and other income decreased $10.4 million, or 16.9%, to $51.0 million in 2015 from $61.4 million in 2014. Lower distribution fees of $47.7 million in 2015 versus $56.1 million for the prior year, principally as a result of decreased average AUM in our open-end equity mutual funds of 10.7% and a decrease of $2.0 million in fees from the sale of load shares of mutual funds and other income contributed to this decrease.\nExpenses\nCompensation: Total compensation costs, which are largely variable in nature, decreased $14.8 million, or 9.8%, to $136.5 million in 2015 from $151.3 million in 2014. Variable compensation costs, principally portfolio manager and relationship manager fees, decreased $11.6 million to $110.2 million in 2015 from $121.8 million in 2014 and remained steady as a percent of revenues at 28.9% in both 2015 and 2014. Variable compensation is driven by revenue levels which decreased in 2015 from 2014. Fixed compensation costs decreased to $26.3 million in 2015 from $29.5 million in 2014.\nStock based compensation: Stock based compensation was $9.9 million in 2015, an increase of $4.6 million, as compared to $5.3 million in 2014. The increase primarily results from the acceleration of 130,650 RSAs during 2015 for an additional expense of $3.5 million that would have been recognized in future years.\nManagement Fee: In 2015 management fee expense decreased to $15.5 million versus $18.7 million in 2014. Management fee expense is incentive-based and entirely variable in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits which is paid to Mr. Gabelli (or his designee) in accordance with his employment agreement.\nDistribution Costs: Distribution costs, which include marketing, promotion and distribution costs decreased $7.7 million, or 12.9%, to $52.0 million in 2015 from $59.7 million in 2014 driven by a decrease in average open-end equity mutual funds AUM of 10.7%.\nOther Operating Expenses: Our other operating expenses were $19.2 million in 2015 compared to $17.5 million in 2014, an increase of $1.7 million or 9.7%. The year over year increase was attributable to recovery of legal expense in 2014 related to prior years of $1.3 million. The remainder of $0.4 million increase was spread among multiple categories of expense.\nOperating Income and Margin\nOperating income decreased $21.6 million, or 12.7%, to $147.9 million for 2015 versus $169.5 million in the prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to the declines in revenues which were largely attributable to the lower levels of average AUM in 2015 versus 2014. Operating margin was 38.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015, versus 40.2% in the prior year period. The decline in operating margin was due to increased fixed costs as a percentage of revenues partially offset by lower management fee expense.\nOperating income before management fee was $163.5 million for the year ended of 2015, versus $188.1 million in the prior year. Operating margin before management fee was 42.9% in the 2015 period versus 44.6% in the 2014 period.

Under the program the Board approved a $0.25 per share contribution, resulting in a charge of $6.4 million in 2015. During 2013, the Board had approved a $0.25 per share contribution that was not finalized as to which shareholders would participate until 2014. As a result there was $0.1 million of expense recorded in 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate ( ETR\u201d) was 37.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015, versus 36.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nShareholder Compensation and Initiatives\nDuring 2015, we returned $34.7 million of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We returned to shareholders a total of $0.28 per share in regular quarterly cash dividends in 2015 totaling $7.5 million. During 2014, we returned $45.6 million of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We returned to shareholders a total of $0.25 per share in regular quarterly cash dividends and one special cash dividend of $0.25 per share in 2014 totaling $12.9 million.\nThrough our stock buyback program, we repurchased 426,628 and 414,432 shares in 2015 and 2014, respectively, for approximately $27.2 million and $32.7 million, or $63.85 and $78.99 per share, respectively (for 2015, 413,228 shares were at an average investment of $64.86 per share prior to the distribution of AC on November 30, 2015 and 13,400 shares were at an average price of $32.56 following the distribution of AC). Approximately 582,000 shares remain authorized under our stock buyback program at December 31, 2015. Since our IPO we have repurchased 9,552,653 shares for a total investment of $428.0 million, or $44.81 per share.\nWeighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in 2015 and 2014 were 25.7 million and 25.6 million, respectively.\nThere were no stock options outstanding at December 31, 2015.\nOperating income before management fee expense is used by management for purposes of evaluating its business operations. We believe this measure is useful in illustrating the operating results of the Company as management fee expense is based on pre-tax income before management fee expense, which includes non-operating items including investment gains and losses from the Company's proprietary investment portfolio and interest expense. We believe that an investor would find this useful in analyzing the business operations of the Company without the impact of the non-operating items such as trading and investment portfolios or interest expense.\nReconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 380,976\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 421,936\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 147,949\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 169,452\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add back: management fee expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,503\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,663\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income before management fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,452\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 188,115\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 38.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 40.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating margin before management fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 42.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 44.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDEFERRED COMPENSATION\nOn December 21, 2015, GAMCO entered into a deferred compensation agreement with Mr. Gabelli whereby his variable compensation for 2016 will be in the form of Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs\u201d) determined by the volume-weighted average price ( VWAP\u201d) of the Company's Class A Stock during 2016. When the restrictions lapse on January 1, 2020 (the Lapse Date\u201d), this RSU agreement can be settled in either cash or stock. Notwithstanding its ability to settle the RSU agreement in stock, GAMCO currently intends to make a cash payment to Mr. Gabelli on the Lapse Date in an amount, under the terms of the agreement, equal to the number of RSUs valued at the lesser of the VWAP of the Company's Class A Stock for the 2016 fiscal year or the value on the Lapse Date or, if not a trading day, then the first trading date thereafter. The Board's decision to grant these RSUs and thereby defer the cash payment of his 2016 variable compensation until January 1, 2020 was to provide the Company with greater financial flexibility. While the issuance of the award itself does not change Mr. Gabelli's compensation, the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d) reporting for his compensation has changed. The 2016 results were materially bolstered by the GAAP-mandated treatment of these RSUs. Margins for 2016 therefore are not comparable with prior periods.\nUnder GAAP, only 25% of this deferred compensation expense is being recognized in the current year with the remainder amortized ratably over 2017, 2018, and 2019. Expressed another way, 2016 benefitted from a reduction of 75% of the compensation, and 2017, 2018, and 2019 will, in turn, be impacted by an additional 25% of the compensation from 2016 in each year.\nThe balance sheet is also impacted; the compensation payable at December 31, 2016 is only 25% of the full amount of the 2016 compensation that will be due once the RSUs are fully vested. At December 31, 2016, the amount of unrecognized compensation was $53.5 million.\nThe following tables show a reconciliation of our results for 2016, and our balance sheet at December 31, 2016 between the GAAP basis and a non-GAAP adjusted basis of the deferred compensation (the RSU grant) as if all of the expense was recognized in 2016. We believe this adjusted measure is useful in evaluating the ongoing operating results of the Company absent the material adjustment related to the treatment of the deferred compensation agreement.\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Full Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Impact

Although investments in partnerships and offshore funds are subject to restrictions as to the timing of distributions, the underlying investments of such partnerships or funds are, for the most part, liquid, and the valuations of these products reflect that underlying liquidity.\nSummary cash flow data derived from our audited consolidated statements of cash flows are as follows:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in) from continuing operations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 115,737\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,130\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 140,458\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,435\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6,198\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,147\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (88,247\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (109,923\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (131,139\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 26,055\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,009\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,172\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows from discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 54,335\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (76,618\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (41,463\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,839\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (12,871\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 66,367\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents from discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6,412\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 26,093\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,025\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,779\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,719\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,694\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,915\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,812\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,719\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,694\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and liquidity requirements have historically been met through cash generated by operating income and our borrowing capacity. We filed a shelf registration with the SEC in 2015 which, among other things, provides us opportunistic flexibility to sell any combination of senior and subordinate debt securities, convertible debt securities, equity securities (including common and preferred stock), and other securities up to a total amount of $500 million. The shelf is available through April 2018, at which time it may be renewed.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $39.8 million, an increase of $26.1 million from the prior year-end primarily due to the Company's operating activities described below. Total face value debt outstanding at December 31, 2016 was $234.2 million, consisting of $100 million of a 4% PIK Note due November 30, 2020, $110 million of a 4.5% Convertible note due August 15, 2021 and $24.2 million of 5.875% senior notes due 2021. It is anticipated that the majority of our cash flow will go towards servicing our debt for the next few years.\nCash provided by operating activities was $115.7 million in 2016 and $117.1 million in 2015. Our largest source of cash comes from net earnings as adjusted for non-cash expenses. In 2016, this totaled $117.1 million versus $87.3 million in 2015. Other sources of cash included an increase in compensation payable of $24.3 million, and an increase in income taxes payable of $13.2 million. Cash uses included an increase of recievables from affiliates of $22.3 million, an increase in investment advisory fees receivable of $19.4 million, reductions of $13.6 million as a result of a decrease in payable to affiliates, reductions in stock based compensation expense of $5.9, a reduction in deferred income taxes of $6.7 million and $0.8 million from other changes in net assets and liabilities. In 2015, cash was provided by net income of $87.3 million, a reduction of assets of $24.6 million and decreases in payable to affiliates, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $8.4 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $1.4 million in 2016 is due to purchases of available for sale securities of $1.8 million less $0.4 million in proceeds from sales of available for sale securities. Net cash used in investing activities of $6.2 million in 2015 is due to purchases of available for sale securities of $6.3 million less $0.1 million in proceeds from sales of available for sale securities.\nNet cash used in financing activities of $88.2 million in 2016 principally resulted from $150 million in repayments of our AC 4% PIK Note due November 30, 2020 , $35 million repayment of the loan from GGCP, $10.8 million of repurchases of our Class A Stock under the Stock Repurchase Program, and $2.3 million in dividends paid offset by the issuance of the 4.5% Convertible Note due August 15, 2021 of $109.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities of $109.9 million in 2015 principally resulted from $76.5 million in repurchases of our 5.875% Senior Notes due June 1, 2021 resulting from the tender offer for those notes in December 2015, $21.7 million in net cash transferred to AC, $27.2 million of repurchases of our Class A Stock under the Stock Repurchase Program, $13.1 million in redemptions of our zero coupon subordinated debentures and $7.5 million in dividends paid partially offset by $35.0 million in borrowings from GGCP and $1.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nUnder the terms of the lease of our Rye, New York office, we are obligated to make minimum total payments of $13.1 million through December 2028.\nOn November 25, 2015, Moody's Investors Services downgraded the Company to Ba1 from Baa3. We continue to maintain an investment grade rating with Standard and Poor's Ratings Services. We believe that our ability to maintain our investment grade rating will provide greater access to the capital markets, enhance liquidity and lower overall borrowing costs.\nG.distributors is registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer and is regulated by FINRA. As such, it is subject to the minimum net capital requirements promulgated by the SEC. G.distributors' net capital exceeded these minimum requirements at December 31, 2016. G.distributors computes its net capital under the alternative method permitted by the SEC, which requires minimum net capital of the greater of $250,000 or 2% of the aggregate debit items in the reserve formula for those broker-dealers subject to Rule 15c3-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, G.distributors had net capital, as defined, of approximately $2.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively, exceeding the regulatory requirement by approximately $2.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Net capital requirements for our affiliated broker-dealer may increase in accordance with rules and regulations to the extent they engage in other business activities.\nOur subsidiary, GAMCO Asset Management (UK) Limited is authorized and regulated by the FCA. In February 2011, GAMCO Asset Management (UK) Limited increased its permitted license with the FCA's predecessor, the Financial Services Authority ( FSA\u201d) and has held Total Capital of \u00a3580,000 and \u00a3519,000 ($713,000 and $769,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively) and had a Financial Resources Requirement of \u00a3265,000 and \u00a3262,000 ($326,000 and $388,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively). We have consistently met or exceeded these minimum requirements.\nMarket Risk\nOur primary market risk exposure is to changes in equity prices and interest rates. Since approximately 95% of our AUM are equities, our financial results are subject to equity-market risk as revenues from our investment management services are sensitive to stock market dynamics. In addition, returns from our proprietary investment portfolio are exposed to interest rate and equity market risk.\nThe Company's Chief Investment Officer oversees the proprietary investment portfolios and allocations of proprietary capital among the various strategies. The Chief Investment Officer and the Board of Directors review the proprietary investment portfolios throughout the year. Additionally, the Company monitors its proprietary investment portfolios to ensure that they are in compliance with the Company's guidelines.\nEquity Price Risk\nThe Company earns substantially all of its revenue as advisory and distribution fees from our affiliated open-end and closed-end funds, Institutional and Private Wealth Management, and Investment Partnership assets. Such fees represent a percentage of AUM, and the majority of these assets are in equity investments. Accordingly, since revenues are proportionate to the value of those investments, a substantial increase or decrease in equity markets overall will have a corresponding effect on the Company's revenues.\nWith respect to our proprietary investment activities, included in investments in securities of $37.3 million and $33.0 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were investments in common stocks totaling $37.2 million and $33.0 million, respectively, and closed-end funds of $0.1 million and $0.0 million, respectively. Of the $37.2 million and $33.0 million, invested in common stocks at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, $37.1 million and $32.6 million, respectively, was related to our investment in Westwood Holdings Group Inc. (NYSE: WHG). Securities sold, not yet purchased are financial instruments purchased under agreements to resell and financial instruments sold under agreement to repurchase. These financial instruments are stated at fair value and are subject to market risks resulting from changes in price and volatility. At December 31, 2016 there were no securities sold, not yet purchased. At December 31, 2015, the fair value of securities sold, not yet purchased was $0.1 million.\nThe following table provides a sensitivity analysis for our investments in equity securities as of December 31, 2016. The sensitivity analysis assumes a 10% increase or decrease in the value of these investments (in thousands):\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> assuming\n</td> <td> </td> <td> assuming\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10% decrease in\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 10% increase in\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (unaudited)\n</td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> equity prices\n</td> <td> </td> <td> equity prices\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> At December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity price sensitive investments, at fair value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,285\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,557\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,014\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> At December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity price sensitive investments, at fair value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,848\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,563\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,133\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment advisory fees for mutual funds and sub-advisory relationships are based on average daily or weekly asset values. Advisory fees earned on Institutional and Private Wealth Management assets, for any given quarter, are generally determined based on asset values at the beginning of a quarter with any significant increases or decreases in market value of assets managed which occur during a quarter resulting in a relative increase or decrease in revenues for the following quarter.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk results, principally, from our investment of excess cash in a money market fund that holds U.S. Government securities. These investments are primarily short term in nature, and the carrying value of these investments generally approximates fair value. Based on December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalent balance of $39.8 million a 1% increase in interest rates would increase our interest income by $0.4 million annually. Given that our current annualized return on these investments is close to 0.37%, an analysis of a 1% decrease is not meaningful.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and capital and operating lease agreements. The following table sets forth our significant contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 5.875% Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,225\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,225\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on 5.875% Senior notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,285\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,423\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,423\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,423\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,423\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AC 4% PIK Note\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 50,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on AC 4% PIK Note\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,066\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,967\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,533\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,733\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,833\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4.5% Convertible note\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 110,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 110,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on 4.5% Convertible note\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 22,894\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,950\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,950\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,950\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,950\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,094\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,091\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,211\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,560\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cancelable operating </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,642\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 290,203\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,256\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,475\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,543\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 59,329\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 139,036\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,564\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe AC 4% PIK Note interest may be paid in kind with additional notes on the same terms as the original note at the Company's option. See Note F Debt for additional details.\nThe capital lease contains an escalation clause tied to the change in the New York Metropolitan Area Consumer Price Index which may cause the future minimum payments to exceed $1,080,000 annually. Any increases to the base rental will be accounted for prospectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not invest in any other off-balance sheet vehicles that provide financing, liquidity, market or credit risk support or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn the ordinary course of business, we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on historical experience, when available, and on other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nWe believe the critical assumptions and estimates are those applied to revenue recognition, the accounting for and valuation of investments in securities, income taxes, and stock based compensation accounting.\nMajor Revenue-Generating Services and Revenue Recognition\nThe Company's revenues are derived primarily from investment advisory and incentive fees, institutional research services and distribution fees.\nInvestment advisory and incentive fees are directly influenced by the level and mix of AUM as fees are derived from a contractually-determined percentage of AUM for each account as well as incentive fees earned on certain accounts. Advisory fees from the open-end funds, closed-end funds and sub-advisory accounts are computed daily or weekly based on average net assets and amounts receivable are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Advisory fees from Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts are generally computed quarterly based on account values as of the end of the preceding quarter, and amounts receivable are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company derived approximately 87%, 87% and 85% of its total revenues from advisory and management fees, including incentive fees, for the periods ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These revenues vary depending upon the level of sales compared with redemptions, financial market conditions, performance and the fee structure for AUM. Revenues derived from the equity-oriented portfolios generally have higher management fee rates than fixed income portfolios.\nThe Company earns incentive fees from certain Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts, which are based upon meeting or exceeding a specific benchmark index or indices. Incentive fees refer to fees earned when the return generated for the client exceeds the benchmark and can be earned even if the return to the client is negative as long as the return exceeds the benchmark. These fees are recognized, for each respective account, at the end of the stipulated contract period which is either quarterly or annually and varies by account. Receivables due for incentive fees earned are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. There were $2.4 million in incentive fees receivable as of December 31, 2016. There were no incentive fees receivable as of December 31, 2015. Management fees on a majority of the closed-end preferred shares are earned at year-end if the total return to common shareholders of the closed-end fund for the calendar year exceeds the dividend rate of the preferred shares. These fees are recognized at the end of the measurement period, which is annually. Receivables due for management fees on closed-end preferred shares are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. There were $7.3 million in management fees receivable on closed-end preferred shares as of December 31, 2016. There were no management fees receivable on closed-end preferred shares as of December 31, 2015. For The GDL Fund, there is an incentive fee earned as of the end of the calendar year and varies to the extent the total return of the fund is in excess of the 90 day T-Bill Index total return. This fee is recognized at the end of the measurement period, which is annually on a calendar year basis. Receivables due on incentive fees relating to The GDL Fund are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition and were $4.2 million and $3.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDistribution fees revenues are derived primarily from the distribution of Gabelli, GAMCO, Comstock and Teton open-end funds ( Funds\u201d) advised by a subsidiary of GBL, Funds Advisor and a subsidiary of GGCP, Teton. G.distributors distributes these open-end Funds pursuant to distribution agreements with each Fund. Under each distribution agreement with an open-end Fund, G.distributors offers and sells such open-end Fund shares on a continuous basis and pays all of the costs of marketing and selling the shares, including printing and mailing prospectuses and sales literature, advertising and maintaining sales and customer service personnel and sales and services fulfillment systems, and payments to the sponsors of third party distribution programs, financial intermediaries and G.distributors' sales personnel. G.distributors receives fees for such services pursuant to distribution plans adopted under provisions of Rule 12b-1 of the Company Act. G.distributors is the principal underwriter for funds distributed in multiple classes of shares which carry front-end or back-end sales charge or no-load to certain investors.\nUnder the distribution plans, the open-end Class AAA shares of the Funds (except The Gabelli U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund, Gabelli Capital Asset Fund and The Gabelli ABC Fund) and the Class A shares of certain Funds pay G.distributors a distribution or service fee of .25% per year (except the Class A shares of the Westwood Funds which pay .50% per year, except for the TETON Westwood Intermediate Bond Fund which pays .35%, and the Class A shares of the Gabelli Enterprise Mergers and Acquisitions Fund which pay .45% per year) on the average daily net assets of the fund. Class B and Class C shares have a 12b-1 distribution plan with a service and distribution fee totaling 1%. Class B shares were discontinued in 2014.\nDistribution fees from the open-end funds are computed daily based on average net assets. The amounts receivable for distribution fees are included in receivables from affiliates on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nFinally, GBL also has investment gains or losses generated from its proprietary trading activities which are included in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income.\nInvestments in Securities\nInvestments in securities are accounted for as either trading securities\u201d or available for sale\u201d and are stated at fair value. Management determines the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. U.S. Treasury Bills and Notes with maturities of greater than three months at the time of purchase are considered investments in securities. Securities that are not readily marketable are stated at their estimated fair values in accordance with GAAP. A substantial portion of investments in securities are held for resale in anticipation of short-term market movements and therefore are classified as trading securities. Trading securities are stated at fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses reported in current period earnings in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income. AFS investments are stated at fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of other comprehensive income except for losses deemed to be other than temporary which are recorded as realized losses on the consolidated statements of income. Securities transactions and any related gains and losses are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and losses from securities transactions are recorded on the specific identified cost basis and are included in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income.\nAFS securities are evaluated for other than temporary impairment each reporting period and any impairment charges are recorded in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income. Management reviews all available for sale securities whose cost exceeds their fair value to determine if the impairment is other than temporary. Management uses qualitative factors such as diversification of the investment, the intent to hold the investment, the amount of time that the investment has been impaired and the severity of the decline in determining whether the impairment is other than temporary.\nSecurities sold, but not yet purchased are recorded on the trade date, and are stated at fair value and represent obligations of GBL to purchase the securities at prevailing market prices. Therefore, the future satisfaction of such obligations may be for an amount greater or less than the amounts recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate gains or losses recognized are dependent upon the prices at which these securities are purchased to settle the obligations under the sales commitments. Realized gains and losses from covers of securities sold, not yet purchased transactions are included in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income. Securities sold, not yet purchased are stated at fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses reported in current period earnings in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. For each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions and penalties in income tax provision on the consolidated statements of income.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company has granted RSAs and stock options to staff members which were recommended by the Company's Chairman, who did not receive an RSA or option award, and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. We use a fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation provided to our employees. The estimated fair value of RSAs is determined by using the closing price of our Class A Stock on the day prior to the grant date. The total expense, which is reduced by estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the vesting period for these awards which is either (1) 30% over three years from the date of grant and 70% over five years from the date of grant or (2) 30% over three years from the date of grant and 10% each year over years four through ten from the date of grant. The forfeiture rate is determined by reviewing historical forfeiture rates for previous stock-based compensation grants and is reviewed and updated quarterly, if necessary. During the vesting period, dividends to RSA holders are held for them until the RSA vesting dates and are forfeited if the grantee is no longer employed by the Company on the vesting dates. Dividends declared on these RSAs, less estimated forfeitures, are charged to retained earnings on the declaration date. During 2015, the Board of Directors accelerated the lapsing of restrictions on the November 2013 grant of RSAs.\nThe estimated fair value of option awards is determined using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. This sophisticated model utilizes a number of assumptions in arriving at its results, including the estimated life of the option, the risk free interest rate at the date of grant and the volatility of the underlying common stock. There may be other factors, which have not been considered, which may have an effect on the value of the options as well. The effects of changing any of the assumptions or factors employed by the Black Scholes model may result in a significantly different valuation for the options. The total expense, which is reduced by estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the vesting period for these awards which is 75% over three years from the date of grant and 25% after four years from date of grant. The forfeiture rate is determined by reviewing historical forfeiture rates for previous stock-based compensation grants and is reviewed and updated quarterly, if necessary.\nIn connection with the spin-off of AC, the unvested RSA expense relating to the existing GBL RSAs at November 30, 2015 was split between GBL and AC based on the allocation of time of the underlying employees who held the RSAs.\nThe Company has entered into a deferred compensation agreement with Mr. Gabelli whereby his variable compensation for 2016 was in the form of Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs\u201d) determined by the volume-weighted average price ( VWAP\u201d) of the Company's Class A Stock during 2016. The RSUs will vest 100% on January 1, 2020, and the Company intends to settle the award in cash at that time; however, the Company reserves the right to issue shares of the Company's Class A Stock in lieu of such cash payment. Under the terms of the agreement the Company will pay Mr. Gabelli an amount equal to the number of RSUs valued at the lesser of the VWAP of the Company's Class A Stock for the 2016 fiscal year or the value on the lapse date or, if not a trading day, then the first trading date thereafter. Under GAAP, only 25% of this deferred compensation expense is being recognized in 2016 with the remainder amortized ratably over 2017, 2018, and 2019. Notwithstanding its ability to settle the award in stock, given the Company's intent to settle it in cash, in accordance with GAAP (ASC 718), the award is accounted for as a liability-classified award and not as an equity-classified award. The liability is remeasured at fair value on each reporting period from December 31, 2016 until the vesting date. However, given the cap on the obligation in that Mr. Gabelli will not receive cash in excess of the VWAP of the Company's Class A Stock for the 2016 fiscal year, the remeasurement of the liability at fair value will never exceed its value determined using that VWAP price.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nSee Footnote A. Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Developments.\nSeasonality and Inflation\nWe do not believe our operations are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We do not believe inflation will significantly affect our compensation costs, as they are substantially variable in nature. However, the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as information technology and occupancy costs. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations by reducing our AUM, revenues or otherwise.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 to this report.\nIntroduction\nOn November 30, 2015 (the Spin-Off Date\u201d), GBL distributed to its stockholders all of the outstanding common stock of Associated Capital Group, Inc. ( AC\u201d) and its subsidiaries along with certain cash and other assets (the Spin-off\u201d). AC owns and operates, directly or indirectly, the alternatives and the institutional research businesses previously owned and operated by GBL. In the Spin-off, each holder of GAMCO's Class A Common Stock ( Class A Stock\u201d) of record as of 5:00 p.m. New York City time on November 12, 2015 (the Record Date\u201d), received one share of AC Class A common stock for each share of GAMCO Class A Stock held on the Record Date. Each record holder of GAMCO's Class B Stock received one share of AC Class B common stock for each share of GAMCO Class B Stock held on the Record Date. Subsequent to the Spin-off, GAMCO no longer consolidates the financial results of AC for the purposes of its own financial reporting and the historical financial results of AC have been reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented through the Spin-off Date. Historical AUM have similarly been adjusted to remove AUM managed by AC.\nOur revenues are highly correlated to the level of AUM and fees associated with our various investment products, rather than our own corporate assets. AUM, which are directly influenced by the level and changes of the overall equity markets, can also fluctuate through acquisitions, the creation of new products, the addition of new accounts or the loss of existing accounts. Since various equity products have different fees, changes in our business mix may also affect revenues. At times, the performance of our equity products may differ markedly from popular market indices, and this can also impact our revenues. It is our belief that general stock market trends will have the greatest impact on our level of AUM and hence, revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $39.7 billion of AUM. We conduct our investment advisory business principally through: GAMCO (Institutional and Private Wealth Management), and Funds Advisor (Funds). We also are a distributor of our open-end funds through our broker-dealer subsidiary G.distributors.\nOrganizational Chart\nSubsequent to the Spin-off, this is the current organizational chart of the Company.\n2016 Business and Investment Highlights\n \u00b7 On December 1, 2016, the Company launched Gabelli Media Mogul (NYSE: MOGLC), its first in a series of actively managed, non-transparent exchange traded managed funds ( ETMFs\u201d). Gabelli Media Mogul will invest primarily in the media industry; specifically in companies that were spun-off from Dr. John Malone's Liberty Media Corporation ( Liberty Media\u201d) as constituted in 2001, including companies formed through subsequent mergers of those spin-offs and companies in which Liberty Media and its successors have invested. \n \u00b7 On October 4, 2016, the Company announced that Katrina O'Leary joined GAMCO's institutional team as Vice President, head of Consultant Relations. Ms. O'Leary will launch a dedicated effort to develop the firm's relationships with the global consulting community. The role underscores GAMCO's commitment to delivering superior risk adjusted returns and providing best in class client service in a rapidly changing investment environment. \n \u00b7 On August 15, 2016, the Company issued a $110 million five year convertible note to Cascade Investment, L.L.C. in a private transaction. The note has a coupon of 4.5% and is convertible into GBL Class A common stock at $55 per share. \n \u00b7 On September 2, 2016, GAMCO completed the initial public offering of The Gabelli Go Anywhere Trust, the Company's 15th closed-end fund. This newly organized closed-end fund initially traded on the NYSE MKT as a $100 combination consisting of one preferred share at $40 and three common shares at $19 each under the symbol GGO.C. This innovative offering demonstrates the flexibility of the closed-end fund structure. Separate trading on the NYSE MKT for the common shares ( GGO\u201d) and the Series A Preferred shares ( GGO.A\u201d) commenced on November 2, 2016. \n \u00b7 2016 was the first full year of advising the Bancroft Fund, and Ellsworth Growth and Income Fund. The Dinsmore team now manages over $350 million in AUM across three closed-end funds. 2016 was also the first full year of advising The Gabelli Value Plus+ Trust, our first London Stock Exchange listed closed-end fund. The Fund had $171 million of AUM at December 31, 2016. \n \u00b7 Net debt improved from $262.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $156.9 million at December 31, 2016. \nOverview\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nInvestment advisory and incentive fees, which are based on the amount and composition of AUM in our Funds, Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts, represent our largest source of revenues. In addition to the general level and trends of the stock market, growth in revenues depends on good investment performance, which influences the value of existing AUM as well as contributes to higher investment and lower redemption rates and facilitates the ability to attract additional investors while maintaining current fee levels. Growth in AUM is also dependent on being able to access various distribution channels, which is usually based on several factors, including performance and service. A majority of our cash inflows to mutual fund products have come through third party distribution programs, including NTF programs. We have also been engaged to act as a sub-advisor for other much larger financial services companies with much larger sales distribution organizations. These sub-advisory clients are subject to business combinations that may result in the termination of the relationship. The loss of a sub-advisory relationship could have a significant impact on our financial results in the future.\nAdvisory fees from the open-end funds, closed-end funds and sub-advisory accounts are computed daily or weekly based on average net assets. Advisory fees from Institutional and Private Wealth Management clients are generally computed quarterly based on account values as of the end of the preceding quarter. These revenues are based on AUM which is highly correlated to the stock market and can vary in direct proportion to movements in the stock market and the level of sales compared with redemptions, financial market conditions and the fee structure for AUM. Revenues derived from the equity-oriented portfolios generally have higher management fee rates than fixed income portfolios.\nWe also receive incentive fees from certain Institutional and Private Wealth Management clients, which are based upon meeting or exceeding a specific benchmark index or indices. These fees are recognized at the end of the stipulated contract period, which may be quarterly or annually, for the respective account. Management fees on assets attributable to a majority of the closed-end preferred shares are earned at year-end if the total return to common shareholders of the closed-end fund for the calendar year exceeds the dividend rate of the preferred shares. These fees are recognized at the end of the measurement period.\nDistribution fees and other income primarily include distribution fee revenue earned in accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the Company Act, as amended, along with sales charges and underwriting fees associated with the sale of the mutual funds plus other revenues. Distribution fees fluctuate based on the level of AUM and the amount and type of mutual funds sold directly by G.distributors or through various distribution channels.\nCompensation costs include variable and fixed compensation and related expenses paid to officers, portfolio managers, sales, trading, research and all other professional staff. Variable compensation paid to sales personnel and portfolio management generally represents 40% of revenues and is the largest component of total compensation costs. Distribution costs include marketing, product distribution and promotion costs. Management fee is incentive-based and entirely variable compensation in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits which is paid to Mr. Gabelli or his designee for acting as CEO pursuant to his 2008 Employment Agreement so long as he is an executive of GBL and devotes the substantial majority of his working time to the business. Other operating expenses include general and administrative operating costs.\nOther income and expenses include net gains and losses from investments (which includes both realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading securities), interest and dividend income, and interest expense. Net gains and losses from investments are derived from our proprietary investment portfolio consisting of various public and private investments.\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests represents the share of net income attributable to the minority stockholders, as reported on a separate company basis, of our consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries and net income attributable to third party limited partners of certain partnerships and offshore funds we consolidate. Please refer to Note A in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nIncome/(loss) on discontinued operations, net of taxes represents the results of the businesses and assets that were part of the Spin-off of AC. Please refer to Note P in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition\nWe ended the 2016 year with approximately $77.1 million in cash and investments. The $77.1 million consists of $39.8 million cash and cash equivalents, primarily invested in our 100% U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund, $0.1 million invested in common stocks and available for sale ( AFS\u201d) securities of $37.2 million. Of the $37.2 million of AFS securities, $37.1 million represent our investment in shares of Westwood Holdings Group.\nThe face value of our debt consisted of $100 million of a 4% PIK Note due to AC, $110 million of a 4.5% convertible note due August 15, 2021 and $24.2 million of 5.875% senior notes due June 1, 2021.\nEquity was a negative $166.6 million on December 31, 2016 compared to a negative $276.3 million on December 31, 2015.\nWe filed a shelf registration with the SEC in 2015 which, among other things, provides us the flexibility to sell any combination of senior and subordinate debt securities, convertible debt securities, equity securities (including common and preferred stock), and other securities up to a total amount of $500 million. The shelf is available through April 10, 2018, at which time it may be renewed.\nOur primary short-term goal is to use our liquid resources to pay down our existing debt. As a secondary goal, we will look to opportunistically and strategically grow operating income at what we consider a margin of safety. We will also consider alternatives to return capital to our shareholders including stock repurchases and dividends.\nAssets Under Management Highlights\nWe reported assets under management as follows (dollars in millions):\n\nOur net cash inflows or outflows by product line were as follows (in millions):\n\n (a) Compound annual growth rate. \n (b) Our net cash inflows or outflows for Closed-End equity funds includes distributions, net of reinvestments, to fund holders of $500 million, $461 million, $479 million, $484 million and $454 million in 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. \n\nOur net appreciation and depreciation by product line were as follows (in millions):\n\nAUM at December 31, 2016 were $39.7 billion, an increase of 2.6% from AUM of $38.7 billion at December 31, 2015. Equity AUM were $37.9 billion on December 31, 2016, 2.2% above the $37.1 billion on December 31, 2015. We earn incentive fees for certain institutional client assets, assets attributable to certain preferred issues for our closed-end funds and our GDL Fund (NYSE: GDL). As of December 31, 2016, assets with incentive based fees were $2.5 billion, 7.4% below the $2.7 billion on December 31, 2015. The majority of these assets have calendar year-end measurement periods; therefore, our incentive fees are primarily recognized in the fourth quarter when the uncertainty is removed at the end of the annual measurement period.\nOperating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nRevenues\nTotal revenues were $353.0 million in 2016, $28.0 million or 7.3% lower than the total revenues of $381.0 million in 2015. The change in total revenues by revenue component was as follows (dollars in millions):\n\nInvestment Advisory and Incentive Fees: Investment advisory fees, which comprised 83.0% of total revenues in 2016, are directly influenced by the level and mix of average AUM. Average total AUM declined 10.0% to $38.9 billion in 2016 as compared to $43.2 billion in 2015. Average equity AUM fell 10.6% to $37.2 billion in 2016 from $41.6 billion in 2015, primarily from net outflows. Incentive fees, which comprised 4.4% of total revenues in 2016, result from our ability to either generate an absolute return in a portfolio or meet or exceed a specific benchmark index or indices and can vary significantly from one period to another. Incentive fees were higher in 2016 as a greater number of portfolios exceeded their respective benchmarks as compared to 2015.\nFund revenues decreased $14.9 million or 7.0%, to $199.3 million, driven by lower average AUM. Revenue from open-end funds decreased $21.9 million, or 14.4%, to $130.0 million from the prior year as average AUM in 2016 decreased $2.2 billion, or 12.6%, to $15.2 billion from the $17.4 billion in 2014. Closed-end fund revenues increased $7.0 million, or 11.2%, to $69.3 million from the prior year and was comprised of an increase of $7.8 million in incentive fees on certain closed-end fund AUM partially reduced by a decrease of $0.8 million in investment advisory fees attributable to lower average AUM. Revenue from Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts, excluding incentive fees, which are generally billed on beginning quarter AUM, decreased $11.7 million, or 10.3%, principally due to lower billable AUM levels throughout the course of 2016. Incentive fees earned on certain accounts increased by $1.7 million. In 2016, average AUM in our equity Institutional and Private Wealth Management business decreased $2.1 billion, or 11.1%, for the year to $16.8 billion.\nDistribution Fees and Other Income: Distribution fees and other income decreased $6.5 million, or 12.7%, to $44.5 million in 2016 from $51.0 million in 2015. Lower distribution fees of $41.0 million in 2016 versus $47.7 million for the prior year, principally as a result of decreased average AUM in our open-end equity mutual funds of 13.7%, offset by an increase of $0.2 million in fees from the sale of load shares of mutual funds and other income, contributed to this decrease.\nExpenses\nCompensation: Total compensation costs, which are largely variable in nature, decreased $53.9 million, or 39.5%, to $82.6 million in 2016 from $136.5 million in 2015. Variable compensation costs, principally portfolio manager and relationship manager fees, decreased $53.6 million to $56.6 million in 2016 from $110.2 million in 2015 and decreased as a percent of revenues to 16.0% in 2016 from 28.9% in 2015. The principle reason was the December 2015 Restricted Stock Units ( RSU\u201d) agreement with Mr. Gabelli which reduced variable compensation by $44.6 million in 2016. (see page 34) Variable compensation is also driven by revenue levels which decreased in 2016 from 2015. Fixed compensation costs decreased slightly to $26.0 million in 2016 from $26.3 million in 2015.\nStock based compensation: Stock based compensation was $4.0 million in 2016, a decrease of $5.9 million, as compared to $9.9 million in 2015. The decrease primarily results from the acceleration of 130,650 RSAs during 2015 for an additional expense of $3.5 million that would have been recognized in future years.\nManagement Fee: In 2016 management fee expense decreased to $6.5 million versus $15.5 million in 2015. Management fee expense is incentive-based and entirely variable in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits which is paid to Mr. Gabelli (or his designee) in accordance with his employment agreement. Most importantly the December 2015 RSU agreement reduced the management fee by $12.4 million in 2016. (see page 34)\nDistribution Costs: Distribution costs, which include marketing, promotion and distribution costs decreased $7.8 million, or 15.0%, to $44.2 million in 2016 from $52.0 million in 2015 driven by a decrease in average open-end equity mutual funds AUM of 13.7%.\nOther Operating Expenses: Our other operating expenses were $23.9 million in 2016 compared to $19.2 million in 2015, an increase of $4.7 million or 24.4%. The largest components of this increase were additional donated securities expense of $1.6 million and an increase to the research services fee of $1.5 million.\nOperating Income and Margin\nOperating income increased $43.9 million, or 29.7%, to $191.8 million for 2016 versus $147.9 million in the prior year period. This increase was primarily due to higher incentive fees of $11.0 million and reduced variable compensation expense relating to the RSU agreement of $57.0 million partially offset by lower non-incentive fee revenues of $39.0 million. Operating margin was 54.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016, versus 38.8% in the prior year period. The increase in operating margin was due primarily to lower variable compensation costs and management fee expense related to the RSU agreement. (see page 34)\nOperating income before management fee was $198.3 million for the year ended of 2016, versus $163.5 million in the prior year. Operating margin before management fee was 56.2% in the 2016 period versus 42.9% in the 2015 period. The reconciliation of operating income before management fee and operating margin before management fee, both of which are non-GAAP measures to their respective GAAP measures, is provided at the end of this section.\nOther Income and Expense\nTotal other income (expense), net of interest expense, was an expense of $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to an expense of $8.9 million in 2015. This is comprised of net gain from investments of $1.6 million in 2016 as compared to $5.0 million in 2015; loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.1 million in 2015; interest and dividend income of $1.5 million in 2016 versus $2.2 million in 2015; interest expense of $12.7 million in 2016 as compared to $8.6 million in 2015 and Shareholder-designated contribution expense of $6.4 million in 2015.\nInterest expense increased $4.1 million to $12.7 million in 2016, from $8.6 million in 2015 primarily related to the higher average amount of debt outstanding in 2016 versus 2015.\nIn 2015, the Board of Directors of GBL again adopted a Shareholder Designated Charitable Contribution program on behalf of all registered Class A and Class B shareholders. Under the programs the Board approved a $0.25 per share contribution, resulting in a charge of $6.4 million in 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate ( ETR\u201d) was 35.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, versus 37.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The ETR for 2016 benefitted by 1.4% due to the reversal of tax accruals related to the closing out of a state audit.\nShareholder Compensation and Initiatives\nDuring 2016, we returned $13.2 million of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We returned to shareholders a total of $0.08 per share in regular quarterly cash dividends in 2016 totaling $2.4 million. During 2015, we returned $34.7 million of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We returned to shareholders a total of $0.28 per share in regular quarterly cash dividends totaling $7.5 million.\nThrough our stock buyback program, we repurchased 348,687 and 426,628 shares in 2016 and 2015, respectively, for approximately $10.8 million and $27.2 million, or $30.88 and $63.85 per share, respectively (For 2015, 413,228 shares were at an average investment of $64.86 per share prior to the distribution of AC on November 30, 2015 and 13,400 shares were at an average price of $32.56 following the distribution of AC). Approximately 233,000 shares remain authorized under our stock buyback program at December 31, 2016. Since our IPO we have repurchased 9,901,340 shares for a total investment of $438.8 million, or $44.32 per share.\nWeighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in 2016 and 2015 were 30.2 million and 25.7 million, respectively.\nOperating income before management fee expense is used by management for purposes of evaluating its business operations. We believe this measure is useful in illustrating the operating results of the Company as management fee expense is based on pre-tax income before management fee expense, which includes non-operating items including investment gains and losses from the Company's proprietary investment portfolio and interest expense. We believe that an investor would find this useful in analyzing the business operations of the Company without the impact of the non-operating items such as trading and investment portfolios or interest expense.\nReconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP:\n\nOperating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 as Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues\nTotal revenues were $381.0 million in 2015, $40.9 million or 9.7% lower than the total revenues of $421.9 million in 2014. The change in total revenues by revenue component was as follows (dollars in millions):\n\nInvestment Advisory and Incentive Fees: Investment advisory fees, which comprised 85.5% of total revenues in 2015, are directly influenced by the level and mix of average AUM. Average total AUM declined 7.5% to $43.2 billion in 2015 as compared to $46.7 billion in 2014. Average equity AUM fell 7.3% to $41.6 billion in 2015 from $44.9 billion in 2014, primarily from net outflows. Incentive fees, which comprised 1.2% of total revenues in 2015, result from our ability to either generate an absolute return in a portfolio or meet or exceed a specific benchmark index or indices and can vary significantly from one period to another. Incentive fees were lower in 2015 as fewer portfolios exceeded their respective benchmarks.\nFund revenues decreased $23.9 million or 10.1%, to $214.2 million, driven by lower average AUM. Revenue from open-end funds decreased $19.0 million, or 11.1%, from the prior year as average AUM in 2015 decreased $2.0 billion, or 10.3%, to $17.4 billion from the $19.4 billion in 2014. Closed-end fund revenues decreased $5.0 million, or 7.4%, to $62.3 million from the prior year and was comprised of a decline of $3.4 million in incentive fees on certain closed-end fund AUM and a decrease of $1.6 million in investment advisory fees attributable to lower average AUM. Revenue from Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts, excluding incentive fees, which are generally billed on beginning quarter AUM, decreased $6.1 million, or 5.0%, principally due to lower billable AUM levels throughout the course of 2015. Incentive fees earned on certain accounts declined by $1.1 million. In 2015, average AUM in our equity Institutional and Private Wealth Management business decreased $1.3 billion, or 6.3%, for the year to $18.9 billion.\nDistribution Fees and Other Income: Distribution fees and other income decreased $10.4 million, or 16.9%, to $51.0 million in 2015 from $61.4 million in 2014. Lower distribution fees of $47.7 million in 2015 versus $56.1 million for the prior year, principally as a result of decreased average AUM in our open-end equity mutual funds of 10.7% and a decrease of $2.0 million in fees from the sale of load shares of mutual funds and other income contributed to this decrease.\nExpenses\nCompensation: Total compensation costs, which are largely variable in nature, decreased $14.8 million, or 9.8%, to $136.5 million in 2015 from $151.3 million in 2014. Variable compensation costs, principally portfolio manager and relationship manager fees, decreased $11.6 million to $110.2 million in 2015 from $121.8 million in 2014 and remained steady as a percent of revenues at 28.9% in both 2015 and 2014. Variable compensation is driven by revenue levels which decreased in 2015 from 2014. Fixed compensation costs decreased to $26.3 million in 2015 from $29.5 million in 2014.\nStock based compensation: Stock based compensation was $9.9 million in 2015, an increase of $4.6 million, as compared to $5.3 million in 2014. The increase primarily results from the acceleration of 130,650 RSAs during 2015 for an additional expense of $3.5 million that would have been recognized in future years.\nManagement Fee: In 2015 management fee expense decreased to $15.5 million versus $18.7 million in 2014. Management fee expense is incentive-based and entirely variable in the amount of 10% of the aggregate pre-tax profits which is paid to Mr. Gabelli (or his designee) in accordance with his employment agreement.\nDistribution Costs: Distribution costs, which include marketing, promotion and distribution costs decreased $7.7 million, or 12.9%, to $52.0 million in 2015 from $59.7 million in 2014 driven by a decrease in average open-end equity mutual funds AUM of 10.7%.\nOther Operating Expenses: Our other operating expenses were $19.2 million in 2015 compared to $17.5 million in 2014, an increase of $1.7 million or 9.7%. The year over year increase was attributable to recovery of legal expense in 2014 related to prior years of $1.3 million. The remainder of $0.4 million increase was spread among multiple categories of expense.\nOperating Income and Margin\nOperating income decreased $21.6 million, or 12.7%, to $147.9 million for 2015 versus $169.5 million in the prior year period. This decrease was primarily due to the declines in revenues which were largely attributable to the lower levels of average AUM in 2015 versus 2014. Operating margin was 38.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015, versus 40.2% in the prior year period. The decline in operating margin was due to increased fixed costs as a percentage of revenues partially offset by lower management fee expense.\nOperating income before management fee was $163.5 million for the year ended of 2015, versus $188.1 million in the prior year. Operating margin before management fee was 42.9% in the 2015 period versus 44.6% in the 2014 period. The reconciliation of operating income before management fee and operating margin before management fee, both of which are non-GAAP measures to their respective GAAP measures, is provided at the end of this section.\nOther Income and Expense\nTotal other income (expense), net of interest expense, was an expense of $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to an expense of $1.4 million in 2014. This is comprised of net gain from investments of $5.0 million in 2015 as compared to $4.3 million in 2014; loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.1 million in 2015 and $0.1 million in 2014; interest and dividend income of $2.2 million in 2015 versus $2.2 million in 2014; interest expense of $8.6 million in 2015 as compared to $7.7 million in 2014 and Shareholder-designated contribution expense of $6.4 million in 2015 and $0.1 million in 2014.\nInterest expense increased $0.9 million to $8.7 million in 2015, from $7.7 million in 2014 primarily related to the 4% PIK Note payable to AC that was outstanding for one month in 2015.\nIn 2015, the Board of Directors of GBL again adopted a Shareholder Designated Charitable Contribution program on behalf of all registered Class A and Class B shareholders. Under the program the Board approved a $0.25 per share contribution, resulting in a charge of $6.4 million in 2015. During 2013, the Board had approved a $0.25 per share contribution that was not finalized as to which shareholders would participate until 2014. As a result there was $0.1 million of expense recorded in 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate ( ETR\u201d) was 37.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015, versus 36.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nShareholder Compensation and Initiatives\nDuring 2015, we returned $34.7 million of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We returned to shareholders a total of $0.28 per share in regular quarterly cash dividends in 2015 totaling $7.5 million. During 2014, we returned $45.6 million of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We returned to shareholders a total of $0.25 per share in regular quarterly cash dividends and one special cash dividend of $0.25 per share in 2014 totaling $12.9 million.\nThrough our stock buyback program, we repurchased 426,628 and 414,432 shares in 2015 and 2014, respectively, for approximately $27.2 million and $32.7 million, or $63.85 and $78.99 per share, respectively (for 2015, 413,228 shares were at an average investment of $64.86 per share prior to the distribution of AC on November 30, 2015 and 13,400 shares were at an average price of $32.56 following the distribution of AC). Approximately 582,000 shares remain authorized under our stock buyback program at December 31, 2015. Since our IPO we have repurchased 9,552,653 shares for a total investment of $428.0 million, or $44.81 per share.\nWeighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in 2015 and 2014 were 25.7 million and 25.6 million, respectively.\nThere were no stock options outstanding at December 31, 2015.\nOperating income before management fee expense is used by management for purposes of evaluating its business operations. We believe this measure is useful in illustrating the operating results of the Company as management fee expense is based on pre-tax income before management fee expense, which includes non-operating items including investment gains and losses from the Company's proprietary investment portfolio and interest expense. We believe that an investor would find this useful in analyzing the business operations of the Company without the impact of the non-operating items such as trading and investment portfolios or interest expense.\nReconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP:\n\nDEFERRED COMPENSATION\nOn December 21, 2015, GAMCO entered into a deferred compensation agreement with Mr. Gabelli whereby his variable compensation for 2016 will be in the form of Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs\u201d) determined by the volume-weighted average price ( VWAP\u201d) of the Company's Class A Stock during 2016. When the restrictions lapse on January 1, 2020 (the Lapse Date\u201d), this RSU agreement can be settled in either cash or stock. Notwithstanding its ability to settle the RSU agreement in stock, GAMCO currently intends to make a cash payment to Mr. Gabelli on the Lapse Date in an amount, under the terms of the agreement, equal to the number of RSUs valued at the lesser of the VWAP of the Company's Class A Stock for the 2016 fiscal year or the value on the Lapse Date or, if not a trading day, then the first trading date thereafter. The Board's decision to grant these RSUs and thereby defer the cash payment of his 2016 variable compensation until January 1, 2020 was to provide the Company with greater financial flexibility. While the issuance of the award itself does not change Mr. Gabelli's compensation, the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d) reporting for his compensation has changed. The 2016 results were materially bolstered by the GAAP-mandated treatment of these RSUs. Margins for 2016 therefore are not comparable with prior periods.\nUnder GAAP, only 25% of this deferred compensation expense is being recognized in the current year with the remainder amortized ratably over 2017, 2018, and 2019. Expressed another way, 2016 benefitted from a reduction of 75% of the compensation, and 2017, 2018, and 2019 will, in turn, be impacted by an additional 25% of the compensation from 2016 in each year.\nThe balance sheet is also impacted; the compensation payable at December 31, 2016 is only 25% of the full amount of the 2016 compensation that will be due once the RSUs are fully vested. At December 31, 2016, the amount of unrecognized compensation was $53.5 million.\nThe following tables show a reconciliation of our results for 2016, and our balance sheet at December 31, 2016 between the GAAP basis and a non-GAAP adjusted basis of the deferred compensation (the RSU grant) as if all of the expense was recognized in 2016. We believe this adjusted measure is useful in evaluating the ongoing operating results of the Company absent the material adjustment related to the treatment of the deferred compensation agreement.\n\nDEFERRED COMPENSATION (continued)\n\nThe following further illustrates the effect that the GAAP accounting for the compensation deferral has on our results for 2016 through 2019.\nEffect of recording RSU on a GAAP basis versus recording all of the expense in 2016:\n\nOn December 23, 2016, it was announced that the Company and Mr. Gabelli agreed to enter into a new deferred compensation agreement for the period of January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017. Mr. Gabelli's compensation for that period will be in the form of an RSU and will vest on July 1, 2018. For GAAP accounting purposes, the compensation earned from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017 will be expensed ratably from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal assets are highly liquid in nature and consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and securities held for investment purposes. Cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of 100% U.S. Treasury money market funds managed by GAMCO. Although investments in partnerships and offshore funds are subject to restrictions as to the timing of distributions, the underlying investments of such partnerships or funds are, for the most part, liquid, and the valuations of these products reflect that underlying liquidity.\nSummary cash flow data derived from our audited consolidated statements of cash flows are as follows:\n\nCash and liquidity requirements have historically been met through cash generated by operating income and our borrowing capacity. We filed a shelf registration with the SEC in 2015 which, among other things, provides us opportunistic flexibility to sell any combination of senior and subordinate debt securities, convertible debt securities, equity securities (including common and preferred stock), and other securities up to a total amount of $500 million. The shelf is available through April 2018, at which time it may be renewed.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $39.8 million, an increase of $26.1 million from the prior year-end primarily due to the Company's operating activities described below. Total face value debt outstanding at December 31, 2016 was $234.2 million, consisting of $100 million of a 4% PIK Note due November 30, 2020, $110 million of a 4.5% Convertible note due August 15, 2021 and $24.2 million of 5.875% senior notes due 2021. It is anticipated that the majority of our cash flow will go towards servicing our debt for the next few years.\nCash provided by operating activities was $115.7 million in 2016 and $117.1 million in 2015. Our largest source of cash comes from net earnings as adjusted for non-cash expenses. In 2016, this totaled $117.1 million versus $87.3 million in 2015. Other sources of cash included an increase in compensation payable of $24.3 million, and an increase in income taxes payable of $13.2 million. Cash uses included an increase of recievables from affiliates of $22.3 million, an increase in investment advisory fees receivable of $19.4 million, reductions of $13.6 million as a result of a decrease in payable to affiliates, reductions in stock based compensation expense of $5.9, a reduction in deferred income taxes of $6.7 million and $0.8 million from other changes in net assets and liabilities. In 2015, cash was provided by net income of $87.3 million, a reduction of assets of $24.6 million and decreases in payable to affiliates, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $8.4 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $1.4 million in 2016 is due to purchases of available for sale securities of $1.8 million less $0.4 million in proceeds from sales of available for sale securities. Net cash used in investing activities of $6.2 million in 2015 is due to purchases of available for sale securities of $6.3 million less $0.1 million in proceeds from sales of available for sale securities.\nNet cash used in financing activities of $88.2 million in 2016 principally resulted from $150 million in repayments of our AC 4% PIK Note due November 30, 2020 , $35 million repayment of the loan from GGCP, $10.8 million of repurchases of our Class A Stock under the Stock Repurchase Program, and $2.3 million in dividends paid offset by the issuance of the 4.5% Convertible Note due August 15, 2021 of $109.8 million. Net cash used in financing activities of $109.9 million in 2015 principally resulted from $76.5 million in repurchases of our 5.875% Senior Notes due June 1, 2021 resulting from the tender offer for those notes in December 2015, $21.7 million in net cash transferred to AC, $27.2 million of repurchases of our Class A Stock under the Stock Repurchase Program, $13.1 million in redemptions of our zero coupon subordinated debentures and $7.5 million in dividends paid partially offset by $35.0 million in borrowings from GGCP and $1.2 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nUnder the terms of the lease of our Rye, New York office, we are obligated to make minimum total payments of $13.1 million through December 2028.\nOn November 25, 2015, Moody's Investors Services downgraded the Company to Ba1 from Baa3. We continue to maintain an investment grade rating with Standard and Poor's Ratings Services. We believe that our ability to maintain our investment grade rating will provide greater access to the capital markets, enhance liquidity and lower overall borrowing costs.\nG.distributors is registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer and is regulated by FINRA. As such, it is subject to the minimum net capital requirements promulgated by the SEC. G.distributors' net capital exceeded these minimum requirements at December 31, 2016. G.distributors computes its net capital under the alternative method permitted by the SEC, which requires minimum net capital of the greater of $250,000 or 2% of the aggregate debit items in the reserve formula for those broker-dealers subject to Rule 15c3-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, G.distributors had net capital, as defined, of approximately $2.8 million and $1.6 million, respectively, exceeding the regulatory requirement by approximately $2.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Net capital requirements for our affiliated broker-dealer may increase in accordance with rules and regulations to the extent they engage in other business activities.\nOur subsidiary, GAMCO Asset Management (UK) Limited is authorized and regulated by the FCA. In February 2011, GAMCO Asset Management (UK) Limited increased its permitted license with the FCA's predecessor, the Financial Services Authority ( FSA\u201d) and has held Total Capital of \u00a3580,000 and \u00a3519,000 ($713,000 and $769,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively) and had a Financial Resources Requirement of \u00a3265,000 and \u00a3262,000 ($326,000 and $388,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively). We have consistently met or exceeded these minimum requirements.\nMarket Risk\nOur primary market risk exposure is to changes in equity prices and interest rates. Since approximately 95% of our AUM are equities, our financial results are subject to equity-market risk as revenues from our investment management services are sensitive to stock market dynamics. In addition, returns from our proprietary investment portfolio are exposed to interest rate and equity market risk.\nThe Company's Chief Investment Officer oversees the proprietary investment portfolios and allocations of proprietary capital among the various strategies. The Chief Investment Officer and the Board of Directors review the proprietary investment portfolios throughout the year. Additionally, the Company monitors its proprietary investment portfolios to ensure that they are in compliance with the Company's guidelines.\nEquity Price Risk\nThe Company earns substantially all of its revenue as advisory and distribution fees from our affiliated open-end and closed-end funds, Institutional and Private Wealth Management, and Investment Partnership assets. Such fees represent a percentage of AUM, and the majority of these assets are in equity investments. Accordingly, since revenues are proportionate to the value of those investments, a substantial increase or decrease in equity markets overall will have a corresponding effect on the Company's revenues.\nWith respect to our proprietary investment activities, included in investments in securities of $37.3 million and $33.0 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were investments in common stocks totaling $37.2 million and $33.0 million, respectively, and closed-end funds of $0.1 million and $0.0 million, respectively. Of the $37.2 million and $33.0 million, invested in common stocks at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, $37.1 million and $32.6 million, respectively, was related to our investment in Westwood Holdings Group Inc. (NYSE: WHG). Securities sold, not yet purchased are financial instruments purchased under agreements to resell and financial instruments sold under agreement to repurchase. These financial instruments are stated at fair value and are subject to market risks resulting from changes in price and volatility. At December 31, 2016 there were no securities sold, not yet purchased. At December 31, 2015, the fair value of securities sold, not yet purchased was $0.1 million.\nThe following table provides a sensitivity analysis for our investments in equity securities as of December 31, 2016. The sensitivity analysis assumes a 10% increase or decrease in the value of these investments (in thousands):\n\nInvestment advisory fees for mutual funds and sub-advisory relationships are based on average daily or weekly asset values. Advisory fees earned on Institutional and Private Wealth Management assets, for any given quarter, are generally determined based on asset values at the beginning of a quarter with any significant increases or decreases in market value of assets managed which occur during a quarter resulting in a relative increase or decrease in revenues for the following quarter.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate risk results, principally, from our investment of excess cash in a money market fund that holds U.S. Government securities. These investments are primarily short term in nature, and the carrying value of these investments generally approximates fair value. Based on December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalent balance of $39.8 million a 1% increase in interest rates would increase our interest income by $0.4 million annually. Given that our current annualized return on these investments is close to 0.37%, an analysis of a 1% decrease is not meaningful.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and capital and operating lease agreements. The following table sets forth our significant contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\n\nThe AC 4% PIK Note interest may be paid in kind with additional notes on the same terms as the original note at the Company's option. See Note F Debt for additional details.\nThe capital lease contains an escalation clause tied to the change in the New York Metropolitan Area Consumer Price Index which may cause the future minimum payments to exceed $1,080,000 annually. Any increases to the base rental will be accounted for prospectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not invest in any other off-balance sheet vehicles that provide financing, liquidity, market or credit risk support or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn the ordinary course of business, we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We base our estimates on historical experience, when available, and on other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nWe believe the critical assumptions and estimates are those applied to revenue recognition, the accounting for and valuation of investments in securities, income taxes, and stock based compensation accounting.\nMajor Revenue-Generating Services and Revenue Recognition\nThe Company's revenues are derived primarily from investment advisory and incentive fees, institutional research services and distribution fees.\nInvestment advisory and incentive fees are directly influenced by the level and mix of AUM as fees are derived from a contractually-determined percentage of AUM for each account as well as incentive fees earned on certain accounts. Advisory fees from the open-end funds, closed-end funds and sub-advisory accounts are computed daily or weekly based on average net assets and amounts receivable are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Advisory fees from Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts are generally computed quarterly based on account values as of the end of the preceding quarter, and amounts receivable are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The Company derived approximately 87%, 87% and 85% of its total revenues from advisory and management fees, including incentive fees, for the periods ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These revenues vary depending upon the level of sales compared with redemptions, financial market conditions, performance and the fee structure for AUM. Revenues derived from the equity-oriented portfolios generally have higher management fee rates than fixed income portfolios.\nThe Company earns incentive fees from certain Institutional and Private Wealth Management accounts, which are based upon meeting or exceeding a specific benchmark index or indices. Incentive fees refer to fees earned when the return generated for the client exceeds the benchmark and can be earned even if the return to the client is negative as long as the return exceeds the benchmark. These fees are recognized, for each respective account, at the end of the stipulated contract period which is either quarterly or annually and varies by account. Receivables due for incentive fees earned are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. There were $2.4 million in incentive fees receivable as of December 31, 2016. There were no incentive fees receivable as of December 31, 2015. Management fees on a majority of the closed-end preferred shares are earned at year-end if the total return to common shareholders of the closed-end fund for the calendar year exceeds the dividend rate of the preferred shares. These fees are recognized at the end of the measurement period, which is annually. Receivables due for management fees on closed-end preferred shares are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. There were $7.3 million in management fees receivable on closed-end preferred shares as of December 31, 2016. There were no management fees receivable on closed-end preferred shares as of December 31, 2015. For The GDL Fund, there is an incentive fee earned as of the end of the calendar year and varies to the extent the total return of the fund is in excess of the 90 day T-Bill Index total return. This fee is recognized at the end of the measurement period, which is annually on a calendar year basis. Receivables due on incentive fees relating to The GDL Fund are included in investment advisory fees receivable on the consolidated statements of financial condition and were $4.2 million and $3.7 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDistribution fees revenues are derived primarily from the distribution of Gabelli, GAMCO, Comstock and Teton open-end funds ( Funds\u201d) advised by a subsidiary of GBL, Funds Advisor and a subsidiary of GGCP, Teton. G.distributors distributes these open-end Funds pursuant to distribution agreements with each Fund. Under each distribution agreement with an open-end Fund, G.distributors offers and sells such open-end Fund shares on a continuous basis and pays all of the costs of marketing and selling the shares, including printing and mailing prospectuses and sales literature, advertising and maintaining sales and customer service personnel and sales and services fulfillment systems, and payments to the sponsors of third party distribution programs, financial intermediaries and G.distributors' sales personnel. G.distributors receives fees for such services pursuant to distribution plans adopted under provisions of Rule 12b-1 of the Company Act. G.distributors is the principal underwriter for funds distributed in multiple classes of shares which carry front-end or back-end sales charge or no-load to certain investors.\nUnder the distribution plans, the open-end Class AAA shares of the Funds (except The Gabelli U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund, Gabelli Capital Asset Fund and The Gabelli ABC Fund) and the Class A shares of certain Funds pay G.distributors a distribution or service fee of .25% per year (except the Class A shares of the Westwood Funds which pay .50% per year, except for the TETON Westwood Intermediate Bond Fund which pays .35%, and the Class A shares of the Gabelli Enterprise Mergers and Acquisitions Fund which pay .45% per year) on the average daily net assets of the fund. Class B and Class C shares have a 12b-1 distribution plan with a service and distribution fee totaling 1%. Class B shares were discontinued in 2014.\nDistribution fees from the open-end funds are computed daily based on average net assets. The amounts receivable for distribution fees are included in receivables from affiliates on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nFinally, GBL also has investment gains or losses generated from its proprietary trading activities which are included in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income.\nInvestments in Securities\nInvestments in securities are accounted for as either trading securities\u201d or available for sale\u201d and are stated at fair value. Management determines the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designations as of each balance sheet date. U.S. Treasury Bills and Notes with maturities of greater than three months at the time of purchase are considered investments in securities. Securities that are not readily marketable are stated at their estimated fair values in accordance with GAAP. A substantial portion of investments in securities are held for resale in anticipation of short-term market movements and therefore are classified as trading securities. Trading securities are stated at fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses reported in current period earnings in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income. AFS investments are stated at fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of other comprehensive income except for losses deemed to be other than temporary which are recorded as realized losses on the consolidated statements of income. Securities transactions and any related gains and losses are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and losses from securities transactions are recorded on the specific identified cost basis and are included in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income.\nAFS securities are evaluated for other than temporary impairment each reporting period and any impairment charges are recorded in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income. Management reviews all available for sale securities whose cost exceeds their fair value to determine if the impairment is other than temporary. Management uses qualitative factors such as diversification of the investment, the intent to hold the investment, the amount of time that the investment has been impaired and the severity of the decline in determining whether the impairment is other than temporary.\nSecurities sold, but not yet purchased are recorded on the trade date, and are stated at fair value and represent obligations of GBL to purchase the securities at prevailing market prices. Therefore, the future satisfaction of such obligations may be for an amount greater or less than the amounts recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The ultimate gains or losses recognized are dependent upon the prices at which these securities are purchased to settle the obligations under the sales commitments. Realized gains and losses from covers of securities sold, not yet purchased transactions are included in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income. Securities sold, not yet purchased are stated at fair value, with any unrealized gains or losses reported in current period earnings in net gain/(loss) from investments on the consolidated statements of income.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts on the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. For each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions and penalties in income tax provision on the consolidated statements of income.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company has granted RSAs and stock options to staff members which were recommended by the Company's Chairman, who did not receive an RSA or option award, and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. We use a fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation provided to our employees. The estimated fair value of RSAs is determined by using the closing price of our Class A Stock on the day prior to the grant date. The total expense, which is reduced by estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the vesting period for these awards which is either (1) 30% over three years from the date of grant and 70% over five years from the date of grant or (2) 30% over three years from the date of grant and 10% each year over years four through ten from the date of grant. The forfeiture rate is determined by reviewing historical forfeiture rates for previous stock-based compensation grants and is reviewed and updated quarterly, if necessary. During the vesting period, dividends to RSA holders are held for them until the RSA vesting dates and are forfeited if the grantee is no longer employed by the Company on the vesting dates. Dividends declared on these RSAs, less estimated forfeitures, are charged to retained earnings on the declaration date. During 2015, the Board of Directors accelerated the lapsing of restrictions on the November 2013 grant of RSAs.\nThe estimated fair value of option awards is determined using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. This sophisticated model utilizes a number of assumptions in arriving at its results, including the estimated life of the option, the risk free interest rate at the date of grant and the volatility of the underlying common stock. There may be other factors, which have not been considered, which may have an effect on the value of the options as well. The effects of changing any of the assumptions or factors employed by the Black Scholes model may result in a significantly different valuation for the options. The total expense, which is reduced by estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the vesting period for these awards which is 75% over three years from the date of grant and 25% after four years from date of grant. The forfeiture rate is determined by reviewing historical forfeiture rates for previous stock-based compensation grants and is reviewed and updated quarterly, if necessary.\nIn connection with the spin-off of AC, the unvested RSA expense relating to the existing GBL RSAs at November 30, 2015 was split between GBL and AC based on the allocation of time of the underlying employees who held the RSAs.\nThe Company has entered into a deferred compensation agreement with Mr. Gabelli whereby his variable compensation for 2016 was in the form of Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs\u201d) determined by the volume-weighted average price ( VWAP\u201d) of the Company's Class A Stock during 2016. The RSUs will vest 100% on January 1, 2020, and the Company intends to settle the award in cash at that time; however, the Company reserves the right to issue shares of the Company's Class A Stock in lieu of such cash payment. Under the terms of the agreement the Company will pay Mr. Gabelli an amount equal to the number of RSUs valued at the lesser of the VWAP of the Company's Class A Stock for the 2016 fiscal year or the value on the lapse date or, if not a trading day, then the first trading date thereafter. Under GAAP, only 25% of this deferred compensation expense is being recognized in 2016 with the remainder amortized ratably over 2017, 2018, and 2019. Notwithstanding its ability to settle the award in stock, given the Company's intent to settle it in cash, in accordance with GAAP (ASC 718), the award is accounted for as a liability-classified award and not as an equity-classified award. The liability is remeasured at fair value on each reporting period from December 31, 2016 until the vesting date. However, given the cap on the obligation in that Mr. Gabelli will not receive cash in excess of the VWAP of the Company's Class A Stock for the 2016 fiscal year, the remeasurement of the liability at fair value will never exceed its value determined using that VWAP price.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nSee Footnote A. Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Developments.\nSeasonality and Inflation\nWe do not believe our operations are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We do not believe inflation will significantly affect our compensation costs, as they are substantially variable in nature. However, the rate of inflation may affect our expenses such as information technology and occupancy costs. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations by reducing our

advisory and fund management activities. The report refers to the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) Section and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements. Key points include:\n\n1. On November 30, 2015, GBL distributed all outstanding common stock of Associated Capital Group, Inc. (AC) and its subsidiaries along with certain assets to its stockholders. Post-spin-off, GBL no longer consolidates AC's financial results.\n\n2. The company's revenues rely heavily on Assets Under Management (AUM), which can fluctuate depending on overall equity market levels, acquisitions, new accounts, or lost accounts. Fees from equity products can impact revenues differently than fees from fixed income portfolios.\n\n3. As of December 31, 2016, the company had $39.7 billion of AUM across various segments such as institutional and private wealth management, and mutual funds.\n\n4. The company launched products such as Gabelli Media Mogul and The Gabelli Go Anywhere Trust in 2016 and appointed new executives to bolster their institutional team.\n\n5. Net debt improved from $262.4 million at the end of 2015 to $156.9 million at the end of 2016.\n\n6. Most cash flows are from investing activities and operating income, with future payments tied to debt agreements and lease obligations.\n\n7. The company has equity price risk as it derives most revenue from fees based on AUM, which is primarily in equities, and has interest rate risk from its investments and proprietary trading activities.\n\n8. GAAP accounting treatments are discussed in detail, with references to the critical accounting policies for revenue recognition, investment valuation, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. \n\n9. A new deferred compensation agreement was established for variable compensation for Mr. Gabelli for 2016, payable in Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) that will vest in 2020.\n\n10. The company states that it doesn't experience significant seasonal fluctuations, and while inflation may affect operational costs, it may not significantly influence the organization due to the variable nature of most expenses.\n\nThe report concludes with a caution on potential adverse effects due to inflation and changes in interest rates."}
