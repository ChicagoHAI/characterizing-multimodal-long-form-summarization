Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data\u201d and the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document. See also Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 2.\nRPC, Inc. ( RPC\u201d) provides a broad range of specialized oilfield services primarily to independent and major oilfield companies engaged in exploration, production and development of oil and gas properties throughout the United States, including the southwest, mid-continent, Gulf of Mexico, Rocky Mountain and Appalachian regions, and in selected international markets. The Company's revenues and profits are generated by providing equipment and services to customers who operate oil and gas properties and invest capital to drill new wells and enhance production or perform maintenance on existing wells.\nOur key business and financial strategies are:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>To focus our management resources on and invest our capital in equipment and geographic markets that we believe will earn high returns on capital. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>To maintain a flexible cost structure that can respond quickly to volatile industry conditions and business activity levels. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>To maintain an efficient, low-cost capital structure which includes an appropriate use of debt financing. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>To optimize asset utilization with the goal of increasing revenues and generating leverage of direct and overhead costs, balanced against increasingly high maintenance requirements and low financial returns experienced during times of low customer pricing for our services. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>To deliver product and services to our customers safely. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>To secure adequate sources of supplies of certain high-demand raw materials used in our operations, both in order to conduct our operations and to enhance our competitive position. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>To maintain and selectively increase market share. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>To maximize stockholder return by optimizing the balance between cash invested in the Company's productive assets, the payment of dividends to stockholders, and the repurchase of our common stock on the open market. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>To align the interests of our management and stockholders. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn assessing the outcomes of these strategies and RPC's financial condition and operating performance, management generally reviews periodic forecast data, monthly actual results, and other similar information. We also consider trends related to certain key financial data, including revenues, utilization of our equipment and personnel, maintenance and repair expenses, pricing for our services and equipment, profit margins, selling, general and administrative expenses, cash flows and the return on our invested capital. Additionally, we compare our trends to those of our peers. We continuously monitor factors that impact current and expected customer activity levels, such as the price of oil and natural gas, changes in pricing for our services and equipment and utilization of our equipment and personnel. Our financial results are affected by geopolitical factors such as political instability in the petroleum-producing regions of the world, overall economic conditions and weather in the United States, the prices of oil and natural gas, and our customers' drilling and production activities.\nCurrent industry conditions are characterized by oil prices which have fallen from a cyclical peak of $75 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2018 to $53 per barrel in the first quarter of 2020. In spite of this significant decrease in the price of oil, the U.S. domestic rig count and well completion counts have not fallen significantly during the fourth quarter of 2019 and into the first quarter of 2020. However, many of our customers indicate that they are curtailing or delaying their drilling and completion plans early in 2020, and we believe that this will have a negative impact on RPC's revenues and earnings during the near term. One catalyst for the recent decrease in the price of oil relates to global supply and demand for the commodity. Early in 2020, a potential slowdown in economic growth is perceived to be a catalyst for lower oil prices, a factor which is exacerbated by continued growth in oil production, particularly in the United States. RPC believes that oil production in the United States has also become an increasingly important determinant of global oil prices, because the United States grew to be the world's largest producer of oil during the second quarter of 2016. Following its recent peak, U.S. oil production fell by 25 percent as of the third quarter of 2017. Since that time, however, improving drilling and completion activity have caused U.S. domestic oil production to rise, and as of the most recent monthly reported statistics, current U.S. oil production has increased to a level that is 42 percent higher than the cyclical low production recorded during the third quarter of 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2018, U.S. oil production rose to its highest level on record. We believe that record U.S. oil production is a catalyst for lower oil prices during the near term. Customer activities directed towards natural gas drilling and production have been weak for several years, with the U.S. domestic natural gas rig count during the first quarter of 2017 falling to the lowest level ever recorded. The U.S. domestic natural gas rig count has increased from this historic low but is still low by historical standards. We believe that customer activities directed towards drilling for natural gas has been weak because of the high production of shale-directed natural gas wells, the high amount of natural gas production associated with oil-directed shale wells in the U.S. domestic market, and relatively constant consumption of natural gas in the United States. We believe that these factors will continue to depress natural gas-directed drilling during the near term. From a low of $1.72 per Mcf during the second quarter of 2017, the price of natural gas had risen to $1.95 per Mcf early in the first quarter of 2020. While current natural gas prices are higher than at the recent cyclical trough, we believe that they are still too low to encourage our customers to conduct exploration and production activities directed exclusively towards natural gas.\nIn 2019, the Company's strategy of utilizing equipment in unconventional basins has continued. During 2019, we made capital expenditures totaling $250.6 million primarily for new revenue-producing equipment and capitalized maintenance of our existing equipment.\nRevenues during 2019 totaled $1.2 billion, a decrease of 29.0 percent compared to 2018 primarily as a result of lower activity levels and lower pricing for certain service lines. Cost of revenues decreased $263.5 million in 2019 compared to the prior year due to lower employment costs, maintenance and repairs expenses, materials and supplies expense and other costs, all of which were driven by lower activity levels. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased to 75.2 percent in 2019 compared to 68.7 percent in 2018.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 13.8 percent in 2019 compared to 9.8 percent in 2018 due to lower revenues over primarily fixed expenses.\nImpairment and other charges were $82.3 million in 2019, primarily due to equipment disposals, closing operating locations and reducing employee staffing.\nLoss before income taxes was $113.1 million for 2019 compared to income before income taxes of $221.3 million in 2018. Net loss for 2019 was $87.1 million, or $0.41 loss per share compared to net income of $175.4 million, or $0.82 earnings per share in 2018. Net income in 2019 and 2018 reflect the lower income tax rates as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017.\nCash flows from operating activities decreased to $209.1 million in 2019 compared to $389.0 million in 2018 primarily due to lower earnings, partially offset by a favorable changes in working capital. As of December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility.\nOutlook\nDrilling activity in the U.S. domestic oilfields, as measured by the rotary drilling rig count, reached a cyclical peak of 1,931 during the third quarter of 2014. Between the third quarter of 2014 and the second quarter of 2016, the drilling rig count fell by 79 percent. During the second quarter of 2016, the U.S. domestic drilling rig count reached the lowest level ever recorded. The principal catalyst for this steep rig count decline was the decrease in the price of oil in the world markets, which began in the third quarter of 2014. The price of oil began to fall at that time due to the perceived oversupply of oil, weak global demand growth, and the strength of the U.S. dollar on world currency markets. During the second quarter of 2016, the price of oil and the U.S. domestic rig count began to increase, and increased steadily throughout the remainder of 2016, 2017 and 2018. At the end of 2019, the U.S. domestic rig count had fallen by approximately 26 percent compared with the end of 2018. RPC monitors rig count efficiencies and well completion trends because the majority of our services are directed toward well completions. Improvements in drilling rig efficiencies have increased the number of potential well completions for a given drilling rig count; therefore, we believe the statistics regarding well completions are more meaningful indicators of the outlook for RPC's activity levels and revenues. Annual well completions in the U.S. completions\nincreased by approximately 30 percent to 14,655 in 2018 compared to 11,277 in 2017, and by approximately seven percent to 15,734 during 2019. However, we believe that U.S. oilfield well completion activity will decline during the near term.\nThe current and projected prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are important catalysts for U.S. domestic drilling activity. During the first two quarters of 2016, the prices of oil and natural gas remained at low levels that discouraged our customers from undertaking most of their potential exploration and production activities. The prices of oil and natural gas increased during the third and fourth quarters of 2016, throughout 2017 and continued during 2018. The price of natural gas declined during 2019 and we do not believe that it is at a level that encourages our customers to increase their natural gas directed drilling and production activities. The price of oil began to increase during 2019, and at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 was approximately 35 percent higher than at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. The average price of natural gas liquids in 2019 decreased by 19.2 percent compared to the average price for the full year 2018.\nThe majority of the U.S. domestic rig count remains directed towards oil. At the beginning of 2020, approximately 85 percent of the U.S. domestic rig count was directed towards oil, a slight increase compared to the prior year. We believe that oil-directed drilling will remain the majority of domestic drilling, and that natural gas-directed drilling will remain a low percentage of U.S. domestic drilling in the near term. We believe that this relationship will continue due to relatively low prices for natural gas, high production from existing natural gas wells, and industry projections of limited increases in domestic natural gas demand during the near term.\nWe continue to monitor the market for our services and the competitive environment. The U.S. domestic rig count had increased sharply since the historical low recorded during the third quarter of 2016 and continuing until the fourth quarter of 2018, though the rig count has declined during 2019. The fact that drilling and completion activities continue to be highly service-intensive and require a large amount of equipment and raw materials carries favorable implications for our activity levels. Furthermore, we note that some wells in the U.S. domestic market have been drilled but not completed. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, the number of wells in this category had decreased by approximately ten percent since the beginning of 2019. These moderately positive economic factors are offset by indications from our customers that they intend to reduce drilling and completion activity during 2020 because they are managing their operations to maximize near-term cash flow. Also, during 2018, we began to observe that oilfield completion crews and equipment were providing services with increasing efficiency, and we believe that this higher efficiency has caused the market for several oilfield completion services, including pressure pumping, to become oversupplied. This trend continued during 2019, and we believe that this development carries negative consequences for pricing of our services, utilization of our equipment and our financial results during the near term.\nActivity levels and pricing for oilfield services reached a level during 2018 that allowed the industry to maintain its equipment and encouraged oilfield service providers to expand their fleets of revenue-producing equipment and hire additional personnel. The prospect of improved financial returns also provided access to the capital markets and allowed previously insolvent service companies to resume operations and add equipment. As a result, competition increased during 2018. Increased competition and improved service efficiency, coupled with the significant decline in oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2018, became catalysts for lower pricing and activity levels in 2019. RPC expanded the size of its fleet of revenue-producing equipment modestly during 2018 and placed orders in the latter part of 2018 for a small amount of new equipment that was delivered in 2019. The equipment we placed in service in 2018 and 2019 is more powerful and efficient than earlier generations of oilfield service equipment, and we believe that it will produce acceptable financial returns as it is placed in service at high utilization levels. Our consistent response to the near-term potential of lower activity levels and pricing is to undertake moderate fleet expansions which we believe will allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet, even if near-term pricing and activity levels generated by such new equipment are modest.\nThe negative implications for RPC's near-term activity levels from low oil prices and increased competition are partially offset by improved availability and lower cost for some of the critical raw materials used in providing RPC's services. In addition, lower activity levels reduce the cost, and increase the availability of, skilled labor. These factors may reduce the cost of providing RPC's services and reduce logistical constraints.\nThe Company recorded impairment and other charges in 2019 of $82.3 million primarily related to equipment disposals, closing operating locations and reducing employee staffing. We made operational decisions resulting in these impairments and other charges because the U.S. oilfield has undergone fundamental changes in the past few years. These changes require equipment which is capable of operating continuously, over long periods of time, and much of our older equipment is not able to fulfill this requirement, no matter how well maintained. We believe that the oilfield will require less pressure pumping equipment in the foreseeable future based on the fact that U.S. oil production has reached record levels while not fully utilizing the pressure pumping capacity that has been available during the period. In addition, we are aware that our customers have been forced to conduct their operations with little or no access to outside capital for the first time in many years, and we assume that this aspect of exploration and production financing will remain in place for the foreseeable future, thereby reducing the volume of future drilling and completion of new wells.\nResults of Operations\nTable 19: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands except per share amounts and industry data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,222,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,721,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,595,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues by business segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technical\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,145,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,647,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,538,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated operating (loss) profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (114,288)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 210,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 226,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating (loss) profit by business segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technical\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (32,993)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 216,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 251,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,228)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,745)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,629)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,561)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment and other charges (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (82,273)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposition of assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (87,111)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 175,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 162,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) Earnings per share -

Revenues in 2019 decreased $498.6 million or 29.0 percent compared to 2018. The Technical Services segment revenues in 2019 decreased $501.7 million or 30.5 percent compared to the prior year. The decrease is due primarily to lower activity levels and lower pricing in several of our service lines as compared to the prior year. The Support Services segment revenues in 2019 increased $3.1 million or 4.2 percent compared to 2018 due primarily to improved activity levels and pricing in the rental tools service line, which is the largest service line within this segment. Technical Services reported an operating loss of $33.0 million during 2019 compared to a profit of $216.7 million in the prior year, while Support Services reported an operating income of $10.0 million in 2019 compared to $4.6 million in the prior year. The average price of oil decreased 12.5 percent and the average price of natural gas decreased 19.2 percent during 2019 compared to the prior year. The average domestic rig count during 2019 was 8.6 percent lower than 2018. International revenues, which decreased from $90.4 million in 2018 to $64.6 million in 2019, were five percent of consolidated revenues in both 2019 and 2018. International revenues decreased in 2019 primarily due to lower customer activity levels in Argentina and to a lesser extent, Canada and Gabon, partially offset by higher activity in Algeria compared to the prior year. Our international revenues are impacted by the timing of project initiation and their ultimate duration.\nCost of revenues. Cost of revenues in 2019 was $919.6 million compared to $1.2 billion in 2018, a decrease of $22.3 percent due to lower employment costs, maintenance and repair expenses, materials and supplies expense and other costs, all of which were driven by lower activity levels. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased to 75.2 percent in 2019 compared to 68.7 percent in 2018 primarily due to lower activity levels and more competitive pricing.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to $168.1 million in 2019 compared to $168.2 million in 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 13.8 percent of revenues in 2019 compared to 9.8 percent of revenues in 2018 due to the negative leverage of lower revenues over primarily fixed expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization were $170.4 million in 2019, an increase of $7.3 million, compared to $163.1 million in 2018 due to capital expenditures made during 2019. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower revenues.\nImpairment and other charges. Impairment and other charges were $82.3 million in 2019, primarily due to equipment disposals, closing operating locations and reducing employee staffing.\nGain on disposition of assets, net. Gain on disposition of assets, net was $3.7 million in 2019 compared to $3.3 million in 2018. The gain on disposition of assets, net is generally comprised of gains or losses related to various property and equipment dispositions or sales to customers of lost or damaged rental equipment.\nOther (expense) income, net. Other expense, net was $0.4 million in 2019 compared to other income, net of $9.3 million in 2018. Other income recorded in 2018 includes property insurance proceeds totaling $9.6 million.\nInterest expense and interest income. Interest expense was $0.3 million in 2019 compared to $0.5 million in 2018. Interest expense in 2019 and 2018 principally consists of fees on the unused portion of the credit facility. Interest income decreased to $1.9 million in 2019 compared to $2.4 million in 2018 due to lower investable cash balances.\nIncome tax (benefit) provision. The income tax benefit was $26.0 million in 2019 compared to a provision of $45.9 million in 2018. The effective tax rate was 23.0 percent in 2019 compared to 20.7 percent in 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2019 is due primarily to certain state taxes based on revenues rather than taxable income or losses and unfavorable discrete adjustments in 2019 compared to 2018.\nNet (loss) income and diluted (loss) earnings per share. Net loss was $87.1 million in 2019, or $0.41 loss per diluted share, compared to net income of $175.4 million in 2018, or $0.82 earnings per diluted share. This decrease in earnings per share was due to lower profitability as average shares outstanding was essentially unchanged.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenues. Revenues in 2018 increased $125.8 million or 7.9 percent compared to 2017. The Technical Services segment revenues in 2018 increased $108.9 million or 7.1 percent compared to the prior year. The increase is due primarily to higher activity levels and improved pricing in a few of our services lines as compared to the prior year. The Support Services segment revenues in 2018 increased $16.9 million or 29.7 percent compared to 2017 due primarily to improved activity levels and pricing in the rental tool service line, which is the largest service line within this segment. Technical Services reported an operating profit of $216.7 million during 2018 compared to $251.5 million in the prior year, while Support Services reported an operating income of $4.6 million in 2018 compared to an operating loss of $12.2 million in the prior year. The average price of oil increased 27.9 percent while the average price of natural gas increased 6.4 percent during 2018 compared to the prior year. The average domestic rig count during 2018 was 17.7 percent higher than 2017. International revenues, which increased from $55.9 million in 2017 to $90.4 million in 2018, were five percent of consolidated revenues in 2018 compared to four percent of consolidated revenues in 2017. International revenues increased primarily due to higher customer activity levels in Argentina and to a lesser extent, Mexico and Pakistan in 2018, partially offset by lower activity in Gabon compared to the prior year. Our international revenues are impacted by the timing of project initiation and their ultimate duration.\nCost of revenues. Cost of revenues in 2018 was $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion in 2017, an increase of $132.2 million or 12.6 percent due to higher employment costs, maintenance and repair expenses and other costs, all of which were driven by higher activity levels. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased to 68.7 percent in 2018 compared to 65.9 percent in 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5.6 percent to $168.2 million in 2018 compared to $159.2 million in 2017. These expenses increased due to higher salaries and wages expense consistent with higher activity levels as well as an increase in information technology costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly to 9.8 percent of revenues in 2018 compared to 10.0 percent of revenues in 2017 due to the leverage of higher revenues over primarily fixed expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization were $163.1 million in 2018, a decrease of $0.4 million, compared to $163.5 million in 2017 due to lower capital expenditures in the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher revenues.\nGain on disposition of assets, net. Gain on disposition of assets, net was $3.3 million in 2018 compared to $4.5 million in 2017. The decrease is due to the sale of operating equipment related to its oilfield pipe inspection service line during the second quarter of 2017 that did not recur in the current period. The gain on disposition of assets, net is generally comprised of gains or losses related to various property and equipment dispositions or sales to customers of lost or damaged rental equipment.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income, net was $9.3 million in 2018 compared to of $5.5 million in 2017. Other income recorded in 2018 includes property insurance proceeds totaling $9.6 million. Income recorded in 2017 included a favorable settlement of $2.0 million associated with the resolution of a sales tax matter, as well as a property insurance proceeds of $1.9 million.\nInterest expense and interest income. Interest expense increased to $0.5 million in 2018 compared to $0.4 million in 2017. Interest expense in 2018 and 2017 principally consists of fees on the unused portion of the credit facility. Interest income increased to $2.4 million in 2018 compared to $1.5 million in 2017 due to higher investable cash balances.\nIncome tax provision (benefit). The income tax provision was $45.9 million in 2018 compared to $70.3 million in 2017. The effective tax rate was 20.7 percent in 2018 compared to 30.2 percent in 2017. The decrease in the income tax provision for 2018 primarily reflects the decrease in Federal income tax rates from 35 percent to 21 percent as enacted by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nNet income and diluted earnings per share. Net income was $175.4 million in 2018, or $0.82 earnings per diluted share, compared to $162.5 million in 2017, or $0.75 earnings per diluted share. This improvement in earnings per share was due to higher net income as average shares outstanding was essentially unchanged.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and Cash Flows\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents were $50.0 million as of December 31, 2019, $116.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and $91.1 million as of December 31, 2017.\nThe following table sets forth the historical cash flows for the years ended December 31:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 209,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 389,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 133,704\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (235,788)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (219,727)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (104,386)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (39,592)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (144,070)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (70,103)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided by operating activities in 2019 decreased by $179.9 million compared to the prior year. This decrease is due primarily to a decrease in net income (loss) of $262.5 million, the deferred income tax benefit of $22.2 million and gains due to benefit plan financing arrangement in 2018. These decreases were partially offset by a net favorable change in working capital of $24.9 million. The net favorable change in working capital is primarily due to favorable changes of $27.1 million in accounts receivable due to lower activity levels and revenues in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and $36.6 million in inventories due to lower activity levels. These favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable working capital changes of $34.5 million in accounts payable and $8.3 million in accrued payroll and related expenses.\nCash used for investing activities in 2019 increased by $16.1 million compared to 2018 primarily because of higher capital expenditures in 2019 and property insurance proceeds in 2018.\nCash used for financing activities in 2019 decreased by $104.5 million primarily as a result of a reduction in cash dividends to common stockholders, partially offset by the lower cost of repurchases of the Company's shares on both the open market and for taxes related to the vesting of restricted shares.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2018 increased by $255.3 million compared to the prior year. This increase is due primarily to an increase in net income of $12.9 million, net favorable changes in working capital of $196.7 million and the deferred income tax provision of $64.0 million partially offset by gains due to an insurance recovery and a benefit plan financing arrangement. The net favorable change in working capital is primarily due to favorable changes of $262.6 million in accounts receivable due to lower activity levels and revenues in the third and fourth quarters 2018, $4.3 million in accrued expenses and $6.1 million in prepaid expenses/ other current assets. These favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable working capital changes of $9.3 million in net income taxes receivable/ payable, $9.4 million in inventories, $36.9 million in accounts payable, $11.1 million in accrued state and local taxes and $9.2 million in accrued payroll and related expenses.\nCash used for investing activities in 2018 increased by $115.3 million, compared to 2017, primarily because of higher capital expenditures partially offset by property insurance proceeds.\nCash used for financing activities in 2018 increased by $74.0 million primarily as a result of increased cash dividends to common stockholders coupled with the higher cost of repurchases of the Company's shares on the open market and for taxes related to the vesting of restricted shares.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nThe Company's financial condition as of December 31, 2019 remains strong. We believe the liquidity provided by our existing cash and cash equivalents and our overall strong capitalization will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months. The Company currently has a $125 million revolving credit facility that matures in July 2023. The facility contains customary terms and conditions, including restrictions on indebtedness, dividend payments, business combinations and other related items. On July 26, 2018, the Company amended the revolving credit facility to, among other matters, (1) replace the existing minimum tangible net worth covenant, as well as, (2) extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to July 26, 2023, (3) eliminate any borrowing base limitations on revolving loans when certain criteria exist, (4) reduce the commitment fees payable by RPC and (5) reduce the letter of credit sublimit from $50 million to $35 million. As of December 31, 2019, RPC had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and letters of credit outstanding relating to self-insurance programs and contract bids totaled $19.5 million; therefore, a total of $105.5 million of the facility was available. For additional information with respect to RPC's facility, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nThe Company's decisions about the amount of cash to be used for investing and financing purposes are influenced by its capital position, including the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations and access to borrowings under our facility. We believe our liquidity will continue to provide the opportunity to grow our asset base and revenues during periods with positive business conditions and strong customer activity levels. In addition, the Company's decisions about the amount of cash to be used for investing and financing activities may also be influenced by the financial covenants in our credit facility but we do not expect the covenants to restrict our planned activities. The Company is in compliance with these financial covenants.\nCash Requirements\nCapital expenditures were $250.6 million in 2019, and we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately $80 million in 2020. We expect that a majority of these expenditures in 2020 will be directed towards capitalized maintenance of our existing equipment. The actual amount of capital expenditures will depend primarily on equipment maintenance requirements, expansion opportunities, and equipment delivery schedules.\nThe Company's Retirement Income Plan, a multiple employer trusteed defined benefit pension plan, provides monthly benefits upon retirement at age 65 to eligible employees. During 2019, the Company did not make any contributions to the plan and does not expect to make any contributions to the plan during 2020.\nThe Company has a stock buyback program, initially adopted in 1998 and subsequently amended in 2013 and 2018, that authorizes the repurchase of up to 41,578,125 shares. On February 12, 2018, the Board of Directors increased the number of shares authorized for repurchase by 10 million shares. There were 595,585 shares repurchased on the open market by the Company during 2019, and 8,248,184 shares remain available to be repurchased under the current authorization as of December 31, 2019. The Company may repurchase outstanding common shares periodically based on market conditions and our capital allocation strategies considering restrictions under our credit facility. The stock buyback program does not have a predetermined expiration date.\nThe Company recorded impairment and other charges of $82.3 million during 2019, of which $8.7 million is expected to have a cash impact during 2020.\nOn July 22, 2019, the Board of Directors voted to suspend RPC's dividend to common stockholders. The Company expects to resume cash dividends to common stockholders, subject to the earnings and financial condition of the Company and other relevant factors. The Company has no timetable for the resumption of dividends.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company's obligations and commitments that require future payments include our credit facility, certain non-cancelable operating leases, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. The following table summarizes the Company's significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,132\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 56,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 20,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 19,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 9,132\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Operating leases include agreements for various office locations, office equipment, and certain operating equipment.\n(2)Includes agreements to purchase raw materials, goods or services that have been approved and that specify all significant terms (pricing, quantity, and timing). As part of the normal course of business the Company occasionally enters into purchase commitments to manage its various operating needs.\n(3)Includes expected cash payments for long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet where the timing of the payments is known. These amounts include incentive compensation, severance costs and estimated charges related to disposal of impaired assets. Also includes amounts related to the usage of corporate aircraft. These amounts exclude pension obligations with uncertain funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in the fair value hierarchy (Level 1, 2 or 3) based on the inputs used for valuation. Assets and liabilities that are traded on an exchange with a quoted price are classified as Level 1. Assets and liabilities that are valued using significant observable inputs in addition to quoted market prices are classified as Level 2. The Company currently has no assets or liabilities measured on a recurring basis that are valued using unobservable inputs and therefore no assets or liabilities measured on a recurring basis are classified as Level 3. For defined benefit plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ( SERP\u201d) investments measured at net asset value, the values are computed using inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data or on net asset values calculated by the fund when not publicly available.\nInflation\nThe Company purchases its equipment and materials from suppliers who provide competitive prices, and employs skilled workers from competitive labor markets. If inflation in the general economy increases, the Company's costs for equipment, materials and labor could increase as well. In addition, increases in activity in the domestic oilfield can cause upward wage pressures in the labor markets from which it hires employees, especially if employment in the general economy increases. Also, activity increases can cause increases in the costs of certain materials and key equipment components used to provide services to the Company's customers. When oilfield activity began to increase in the third quarter of 2016, the Company experienced upward pressure on the price of labor due to the shortage of skilled employees as well as occasional increases in the prices of certain raw materials used in providing our services. During 2018, however, prices for the raw material comprising the Company's single largest raw material purchase began to decline due to increased sources of supply of the material, particularly in geographic markets located close to the largest U.S. oil and gas basin. In addition, labor cost pressures during the fourth quarter of 2018 began to abate due to lower oilfield activity. These cost pressures continued to decline during 2019.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements.\nRelated Party Transactions\nMarine Products Corporation\nEffective in 2001, the Company spun off the business conducted through Chaparral Boats, Inc. ( Chaparral\u201d), RPC's former powerboat manufacturing segment. RPC accomplished the spin-off by contributing 100 percent of the issued and outstanding stock of Chaparral to Marine Products Corporation (a Delaware corporation) ( Marine Products\u201d), a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of RPC, and then distributing the common stock of Marine Products to RPC stockholders. In conjunction with the spin-off, RPC and Marine Products entered into various agreements that define the companies' relationship.\nIn accordance with a Transition Support Services agreement, which may be terminated by either party, RPC provides certain administrative services, including financial reporting and income tax administration, acquisition assistance, etc., to Marine Products. Charges from the Company (or from corporations that are subsidiaries of the Company) for such services were $865,000 in 2019, $873,000 in 2018, and $849,000 in 2017. The Company's receivable due from Marine Products for these services was $55,000 as of December 31, 2019 and $28,000 as of December 31, 2018. Many of the Company's directors are also directors of Marine Products and all of the executive officers are employees of both the Company and Marine Products.\nOther\nThe Company periodically purchases in the ordinary course of business equipment or services from suppliers, who are owned by significant officers or stockholders, or affiliated with the directors of RPC. The total amounts paid to these affiliated parties were $1,625,000 in 2019, $1,467,000 in 2018 and $1,372,000 in 2017.\nRPC receives certain administrative services and rents office space from Rollins, Inc. (a company of which Mr. R. Randall Rollins is also Chairman and which is otherwise affiliated with RPC). The service agreements between Rollins, Inc. and the Company provide for the provision of services on a cost reimbursement basis and are terminable on six months' notice. The services covered by these agreements include office space, administration of certain employee benefit programs, and other administrative services. Charges to the Company (or to corporations which are subsidiaries of the Company) for such services and rent totaled $104,000 in 2019, $101,000 in 2018 and $104,000 in 2017.\nA group that includes the Company's Chairman of the Board, R. Randall Rollins and his brother Gary W. Rollins, who is also a director of the Company, and certain companies under their control, controls in excess of fifty percent of the Company's voting power.\nRPC and Marine Products own 50 percent each of a limited liability company called 255 RC, LLC that was created for the joint purchase and ownership of a corporate aircraft. The purchase of the aircraft was completed in January 2015, and the purchase was funded primarily by a $2,554,000 contribution by each company to 255 RC, LLC. Each of RPC and Marine Products is currently a party to an operating lease agreement with 255 RC, LLC for a period of five years. RPC recorded certain net operating costs comprised of rent and an allocable share of fixed costs of $199,000 in 2019 and 2018 and $197,000 in 2017 for the corporate aircraft. The Company has a payable to 255 RC, LLC of $1.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and $0.8 million as of December 31, 2018. The Company accounts for this investment using the equity method and its proportionate share of income or loss is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2019, the investment closely approximates the underlying equity in the net assets of 255 RC, LLC.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating accounting estimates. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, trends in the industry, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies involve estimates that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity:\nAllowance for doubtful accounts - Substantially all of the Company's receivables are due from oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States, selected international locations and foreign, nationally owned oil companies. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our receivables are not overstated due to uncollectibility. Our established credit evaluation procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers. Our customers' ability to pay is directly related to their ability to generate cash flow on their projects and is significantly affected by the volatility in the price of oil and natural gas. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that amounts are uncollectible and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when collected. Significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the period of recovery. Therefore, the provision for doubtful accounts can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Recoveries were insignificant in 2019, 2018 and 2017. We record specific provisions when we become aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If circumstances related to a customer changes, our estimate of the realizability of the receivable would be further adjusted, either upward or downward.\nThe estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our evaluation of the overall trends in the oil and gas industry, financial condition of our customers, our historical write-off experience, current economic conditions, and in the case of international customers, our judgments about the economic and political environment of the related country and region. In addition to reserves established for specific customers, we establish general reserves by using different percentages depending on the age of the receivables which we adjust periodically based on management judgment and the economic strength of our customers. The net provisions for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenues ranged from 0.03 percent to 0.8 percent over the last three years. Increasing or decreasing the estimated general reserve percentages by 0.50 percentage points as of December 31, 2019 would have resulted in a change of $1.1 million to the allowance for doubtful accounts and a corresponding change to selling, general and administrative expenses.\nIncome taxes - The effective income tax benefits were 23.0 percent in 2019, compared to an income tax provision of 20.7 percent in 2018 and 30.2 percent in 2017. Our effective tax rates vary due to changes in estimates of our future taxable income or losses, fluctuations in the tax jurisdictions in which our earnings and deductions are realized, and favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities related to proposed or probable assessments. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis. The effective tax rate for 2019 reflects the decrease in favorable discrete adjustments, along with a higher percentage of permanent adjustments compared to income (loss).\nThe Company establishes a valuation allowance against the carrying value of deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized through future taxable income. Such amounts are charged to earnings in the period the determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance is reversed. The Company considers future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance.\nThe Company calculates the current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified, which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for U.S. federal and state provisions. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the year the differences are expected to reverse. In 2017, the Company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the change in Federal income tax rates, as required by the TCJA. All deferred tax assets and liabilities from December 31, 2017 forward reflect the changed rate.\nThe amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. The Company believes it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates.\nInsurance expenses -The Company self-insures, up to certain policy-specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation, vehicle and equipment liability. The cost of claims under these self-insurance programs is estimated and accrued using individual case-based valuations and statistical analysis and is based upon judgment and historical experience; however, the ultimate cost of many of these claims may not be known for several years. These claims are monitored and the cost estimates are revised as developments occur relating to such claims. The Company has retained an independent third party actuary to assist in the calculation of a range of exposure for these claims. As of December 31, 2019, the Company estimates the range of exposure to be from $19.0 million to $24.2 million. The Company has recorded liabilities at December 31, 2019 of $21.6 million which represents management's best estimate of probable loss.\nDepreciable life of assets - RPC's net property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2019 was $516.7 million representing 49.1 percent of the Company's consolidated assets. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $170.4 million. Management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated useful lives used to calculate the annual and accumulated depreciation and amortization expense.\nProperty, plant and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the Company and is determined by management based on many factors including historical experience with similar assets. Assets are monitored to ensure changes in asset lives are identified and prospective depreciation and amortization expense is adjusted accordingly. We did not make any changes to the estimated lives of assets resulting in a material impact in 2019 or 2018.\nLong-lived assets including goodwill - RPC carries a variety of long-lived assets on our balance sheet including property, plant and equipment and goodwill. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company conducts impairment tests on goodwill annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. In addition, the Company conducts impairment tests on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nFor the impairment testing on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, a long-lived asset is grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group are compared to its carrying amount. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying amount, then the Company is required to determine the asset group's fair value by using a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis is based on estimates such as management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance, including revenue growth rates and expected profitability margins, estimates of the remaining useful life and service potential of the assets within the asset group, and a discount rate based on weighted average cost of capital. An impairment loss is measured and recorded as the amount by which the asset group's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Assessment of goodwill impairment is conducted at the level of each reporting unit, which is the same as our reportable segments, Technical Services and Support Services, comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using an income approach and a market approach. The income approach uses discounted cash flow analysis based on management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance. This analysis includes significant assumptions regarding discount rates, revenue growth rates, expected profitability margins, forecasted capital expenditures and the timing of expected future cash flows based on market conditions. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recorded.\nThe impairment assessments discussed above incorporate inherent uncertainties, including projected commodity pricing, supply and demand for the Company's services and future market conditions, which are difficult to predict in volatile economic environments and could result in impairment charges in future periods if actual results materially differ from the estimated assumptions utilized in our forecasts. If market conditions further deteriorate, including crude oil prices significantly declining and remaining at low levels for a sustained period of time, we could be required to record additional impairments of the carrying value of our long-lived assets in the future which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nDefined benefit pension plan - In 2002, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the defined benefit plan, although the Company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through March 2002. The Company accounts for the defined benefit plan in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits\u201d and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.\nThe Company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the investments strategy, and the views of our investment advisor. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years. Therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains (losses) ultimately affects future pension expense. The Company's assumption for the expected return on plan assets was seven percent for 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nThe discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company utilizes a yield curve approach. The approach utilizes an economic model whereby the Company's expected benefit payments over the life of the plan are forecasted and then compared to a portfolio of investment grade corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. The economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations. The discount rate was 3.60 percent as of December 31, 2019 compared to 4.65 percent as of December 31, 2018 and 4.00 percent in 2017.\nAs set forth in Note 12 to the Company's financial statements, included among the asset categories for the Plan's investments are real estate and alternative/ opportunistic/ special fund investments comprised of real estate funds and private equity funds. These investments are measured at net asset value and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds' judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds' financial statements for reasonableness.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the defined benefit plan was under-funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased stockholders' equity by $3.0 million after tax. Holding all other factors constant, a change in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 0.25 percentage points would result in a pre-tax increase or decrease of $1.3 million to the net loss related to pension reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nThe Company recognized pre-tax pension expense (income) of $0.3 million in 2019, $(0.2) million in 2018 and $0.4 million in 2017. Based on the under-funded status of the defined benefit plan as of December 31, 2019, the Company expects to recognize pension income of $15 thousand in 2020. Holding all other factors constant, a change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 0.50 percentage points would result in an increase or decrease in pension expense of $194 thousand in 2020. Holding all other factors constant, a change in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 0.25 percentage points would result in an increase or decrease in pension expense of $19 thousand in 2020.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued the following applicable Accounting Standards Updates (ASU):\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td>\u25cf </td> <td>Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data\u201d and the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document. See also Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 2.\nRPC, Inc. ( RPC\u201d) provides a broad range of specialized oilfield services primarily to independent and major oilfield companies engaged in exploration, production and development of oil and gas properties throughout the United States, including the southwest, mid-continent, Gulf of Mexico, Rocky Mountain and Appalachian regions, and in selected international markets. The Company's revenues and profits are generated by providing equipment and services to customers who operate oil and gas properties and invest capital to drill new wells and enhance production or perform maintenance on existing wells.\nOur key business and financial strategies are:\n - To focus our management resources on and invest our capital in equipment and geographic markets that we believe will earn high returns on capital. \n - To maintain a flexible cost structure that can respond quickly to volatile industry conditions and business activity levels. \n - To maintain an efficient, low-cost capital structure which includes an appropriate use of debt financing. \n - To optimize asset utilization with the goal of increasing revenues and generating leverage of direct and overhead costs, balanced against increasingly high maintenance requirements and low financial returns experienced during times of low customer pricing for our services. \n - To deliver product and services to our customers safely. \n - To secure adequate sources of supplies of certain high-demand raw materials used in our operations, both in order to conduct our operations and to enhance our competitive position. \n - To maintain and selectively increase market share. \n - To maximize stockholder return by optimizing the balance between cash invested in the Company's productive assets, the payment of dividends to stockholders, and the repurchase of our common stock on the open market. \n - To align the interests of our management and stockholders. \nIn assessing the outcomes of these strategies and RPC's financial condition and operating performance, management generally reviews periodic forecast data, monthly actual results, and other similar information. We also consider trends related to certain key financial data, including revenues, utilization of our equipment and personnel, maintenance and repair expenses, pricing for our services and equipment, profit margins, selling, general and administrative expenses, cash flows and the return on our invested capital. Additionally, we compare our trends to those of our peers. We continuously monitor factors that impact current and expected customer activity levels, such as the price of oil and natural gas, changes in pricing for our services and equipment and utilization of our equipment and personnel. Our financial results are affected by geopolitical factors such as political instability in the petroleum-producing regions of the world, overall economic conditions and weather in the United States, the prices of oil and natural gas, and our customers' drilling and production activities.\nCurrent industry conditions are characterized by oil prices which have fallen from a cyclical peak of $75 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2018 to $53 per barrel in the first quarter of 2020. In spite of this significant decrease in the price of oil, the U.S. domestic rig count and well completion counts have not fallen significantly during the fourth quarter of 2019 and into the first quarter of 2020. However, many of our customers indicate that they are curtailing or delaying their drilling and completion plans early in 2020, and we believe that this will have a negative impact on RPC's revenues and earnings during the near term. One catalyst for the recent decrease in the price of oil relates to global supply and demand for the commodity. Early in 2020, a potential slowdown in economic growth is perceived to be a catalyst for lower oil prices, a factor which is exacerbated by continued growth in oil production, particularly in the United States. RPC believes that oil production in the United States has also become an increasingly important determinant of global oil prices, because the United States grew to be the world's largest producer of oil during the second quarter of 2016. Following its recent peak, U.S. oil production fell by 25 percent as of the third quarter of 2017. Since that time, however, improving drilling and completion activity have caused U.S. domestic oil production to rise, and as of the most recent monthly reported statistics, current U.S. oil production has increased to a level that is 42 percent higher than the cyclical low production recorded during the third quarter of 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2018, U.S. oil production rose to its highest level on record. We believe that record U.S. oil production is a catalyst for lower oil prices during the near term. Customer activities directed towards natural gas drilling and production have been weak for several years, with the U.S. domestic natural gas rig count during the first quarter of 2017 falling to the lowest level ever recorded. The U.S. domestic natural gas rig count has increased from this historic low but is still low by historical standards. We believe that customer activities directed towards drilling for natural gas has been weak because of the high production of shale-directed natural gas wells, the high amount of natural gas production associated with oil-directed shale wells in the U.S. domestic market, and relatively constant consumption of natural gas in the United States. We believe that these factors will continue to depress natural gas-directed drilling during the near term. From a low of $1.72 per Mcf during the second quarter of 2017, the price of natural gas had risen to $1.95 per Mcf early in the first quarter of 2020. While current natural gas prices are higher than at the recent cyclical trough, we believe that they are still too low to encourage our customers to conduct exploration and production activities directed exclusively towards natural gas.\nIn 2019, the Company's strategy of utilizing equipment in unconventional basins has continued. During 2019, we made capital expenditures totaling $250.6 million primarily for new revenue-producing equipment and capitalized maintenance of our existing equipment.\nRevenues during 2019 totaled $1.2 billion, a decrease of 29.0 percent compared to 2018 primarily as a result of lower activity levels and lower pricing for certain service lines. Cost of revenues decreased $263.5 million in 2019 compared to the prior year due to lower employment costs, maintenance and repairs expenses, materials and supplies expense and other costs, all of which were driven by lower activity levels. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased to 75.2 percent in 2019 compared to 68.7 percent in 2018.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 13.8 percent in 2019 compared to 9.8 percent in 2018 due to lower revenues over primarily fixed expenses.\nImpairment and other charges were $82.3 million in 2019, primarily due to equipment disposals, closing operating locations and reducing employee staffing.\nLoss before income taxes was $113.1 million for 2019 compared to income before income taxes of $221.3 million in 2018. Net loss for 2019 was $87.1 million, or $0.41 loss per share compared to net income of $175.4 million, or $0.82 earnings per share in 2018. Net income in 2019 and 2018 reflect the lower income tax rates as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017.\nCash flows from operating activities decreased to $209.1 million in 2019 compared to $389.0 million in 2018 primarily due to lower earnings, partially offset by a favorable changes in working capital. As of December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility.\nOutlook\nDrilling activity in the U.S. domestic oilfields, as measured by the rotary drilling rig count, reached a cyclical peak of 1,931 during the third quarter of 2014. Between the third quarter of 2014 and the second quarter of 2016, the drilling rig count fell by 79 percent. During the second quarter of 2016, the U.S. domestic drilling rig count reached the lowest level ever recorded. The principal catalyst for this steep rig count decline was the decrease in the price of oil in the world markets, which began in the third quarter of 2014. The price of oil began to fall at that time due to the perceived oversupply of oil, weak global demand growth, and the strength of the U.S. dollar on world currency markets. During the second quarter of 2016, the price of oil and the U.S. domestic rig count began to increase, and increased steadily throughout the remainder of 2016, 2017 and 2018. At the end of 2019, the U.S. domestic rig count had fallen by approximately 26 percent compared with the end of 2018. RPC monitors rig count efficiencies and well completion trends because the majority of our services are directed toward well completions. Improvements in drilling rig efficiencies have increased the number of potential well completions for a given drilling rig count; therefore, we believe the statistics regarding well completions are more meaningful indicators of the outlook for RPC's activity levels and revenues. Annual well completions in the U.S. completions\nincreased by approximately 30 percent to 14,655 in 2018 compared to 11,277 in 2017, and by approximately seven percent to 15,734 during 2019. However, we believe that U.S. oilfield well completion activity will decline during the near term.\nThe current and projected prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are important catalysts for U.S. domestic drilling activity. During the first two quarters of 2016, the prices of oil and natural gas remained at low levels that discouraged our customers from undertaking most of their potential exploration and production activities. The prices of oil and natural gas increased during the third and fourth quarters of 2016, throughout 2017 and continued during 2018. The price of natural gas declined during 2019 and we do not believe that it is at a level that encourages our customers to increase their natural gas directed drilling and production activities. The price of oil began to increase during 2019, and at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 was approximately 35 percent higher than at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. The average price of natural gas liquids in 2019 decreased by 19.2 percent compared to the average price for the full year 2018.\nThe majority of the U.S. domestic rig count remains directed towards oil. At the beginning of 2020, approximately 85 percent of the U.S. domestic rig count was directed towards oil, a slight increase compared to the prior year. We believe that oil-directed drilling will remain the majority of domestic drilling, and that natural gas-directed drilling will remain a low percentage of U.S. domestic drilling in the near term. We believe that this relationship will continue due to relatively low prices for natural gas, high production from existing natural gas wells, and industry projections of limited increases in domestic natural gas demand during the near term.\nWe continue to monitor the market for our services and the competitive environment. The U.S. domestic rig count had increased sharply since the historical low recorded during the third quarter of 2016 and continuing until the fourth quarter of 2018, though the rig count has declined during 2019. The fact that drilling and completion activities continue to be highly service-intensive and require a large amount of equipment and raw materials carries favorable implications for our activity levels. Furthermore, we note that some wells in the U.S. domestic market have been drilled but not completed. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, the number of wells in this category had decreased by approximately ten percent since the beginning of 2019. These moderately positive economic factors are offset by indications from our customers that they intend to reduce drilling and completion activity during 2020 because they are managing their operations to maximize near-term cash flow. Also, during 2018, we began to observe that oilfield completion crews and equipment were providing services with increasing efficiency, and we believe that this higher efficiency has caused the market for several oilfield completion services, including pressure pumping, to become oversupplied. This trend continued during 2019, and we believe that this development carries negative consequences for pricing of our services, utilization of our equipment and our financial results during the near term.\nActivity levels and pricing for oilfield services reached a level during 2018 that allowed the industry to maintain its equipment and encouraged oilfield service providers to expand their fleets of revenue-producing equipment and hire additional personnel. The prospect of improved financial returns also provided access to the capital markets and allowed previously insolvent service companies to resume operations and add equipment. As a result, competition increased during 2018. Increased competition and improved service efficiency, coupled with the significant decline in oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2018, became catalysts for lower pricing and activity levels in 2019. RPC expanded the size of its fleet of revenue-producing equipment modestly during 2018 and placed orders in the latter part of 2018 for a small amount of new equipment that was delivered in 2019. The equipment we placed in service in 2018 and 2019 is more powerful and efficient than earlier generations of oilfield service equipment, and we believe that it will produce acceptable financial returns as it is placed in service at high utilization levels. Our consistent response to the near-term potential of lower activity levels and pricing is to undertake moderate fleet expansions which we believe will allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet, even if near-term pricing and activity levels generated by such new equipment are modest.\nThe negative implications for RPC's near-term activity levels from low oil prices and increased competition are partially offset by improved availability and lower cost for some of the critical raw materials used in providing RPC's services. In addition, lower activity levels reduce the cost, and increase the availability of, skilled labor. These factors may reduce the cost of providing RPC's services and reduce logistical constraints.\nThe Company recorded impairment and other charges in 2019 of $82.3 million primarily related to equipment disposals, closing operating locations and reducing employee staffing. We made operational decisions resulting in these impairments and other charges because the U.S. oilfield has undergone fundamental changes in the past few years. These changes require equipment which is capable of operating continuously, over long periods of time, and much of our older equipment is not able to fulfill this requirement, no matter how well maintained. We believe that the oilfield will require less pressure pumping equipment in the foreseeable future based on the fact that U.S. oil production has reached record levels while not fully utilizing the pressure pumping capacity that has been available during the period. In addition, we are aware that our customers have been forced to conduct their operations with little or no access to outside capital for the first time in many years, and we assume that this aspect of exploration and production financing will remain in place for the foreseeable future, thereby reducing the volume of future drilling and completion of new wells.\nResults of Operations\nTable 19: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands except per share amounts and industry data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,222,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,721,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,595,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues by business segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technical\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,145,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,647,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,538,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated operating (loss) profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (114,288)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 210,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 226,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating (loss) profit by business segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technical\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (32,993)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 216,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 251,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,228)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,745)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,629)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,561)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment and other charges (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (82,273)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposition of assets, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (87,111)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 175,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 162,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) Earnings per share -

Revenues in 2019 decreased $498.6 million or 29.0 percent compared to 2018. The Technical Services segment revenues in 2019 decreased $501.7 million or 30.5 percent compared to the prior year. The decrease is due primarily to lower activity levels and lower pricing in several of our service lines as compared to the prior year. The Support Services segment revenues in 2019 increased $3.1 million or 4.2 percent compared to 2018 due primarily to improved activity levels and pricing in the rental tools service line, which is the largest service line within this segment. Technical Services reported an operating loss of $33.0 million during 2019 compared to a profit of $216.7 million in the prior year, while Support Services reported an operating income of $10.0 million in 2019 compared to $4.6 million in the prior year. The average price of oil decreased 12.5 percent and the average price of natural gas decreased 19.2 percent during 2019 compared to the prior year. The average domestic rig count during 2019 was 8.6 percent lower than 2018. International revenues, which decreased from $90.4 million in 2018 to $64.6 million in 2019, were five percent of consolidated revenues in both 2019 and 2018. International revenues decreased in 2019 primarily due to lower customer activity levels in Argentina and to a lesser extent, Canada and Gabon, partially offset by higher activity in Algeria compared to the prior year. Our international revenues are impacted by the timing of project initiation and their ultimate duration.\nCost of revenues. Cost of revenues in 2019 was $919.6 million compared to $1.2 billion in 2018, a decrease of $22.3 percent due to lower employment costs, maintenance and repair expenses, materials and supplies expense and other costs, all of which were driven by lower activity levels. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased to 75.2 percent in 2019 compared to 68.7 percent in 2018 primarily due to lower activity levels and more competitive pricing.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to $168.1 million in 2019 compared to $168.2 million in 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 13.8 percent of revenues in 2019 compared to 9.8 percent of revenues in 2018 due to the negative leverage of lower revenues over primarily fixed expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization were $170.4 million in 2019, an increase of $7.3 million, compared to $163.1 million in 2018 due to capital expenditures made during 2019. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower revenues.\nImpairment and other charges. Impairment and other charges were $82.3 million in 2019, primarily due to equipment disposals, closing operating locations and reducing employee staffing.\nGain on disposition of assets, net. Gain on disposition of assets, net was $3.7 million in 2019 compared to $3.3 million in 2018. The gain on disposition of assets, net is generally comprised of gains or losses related to various property and equipment dispositions or sales to customers of lost or damaged rental equipment.\nOther (expense) income, net. Other expense, net was $0.4 million in 2019 compared to other income, net of $9.3 million in 2018. Other income recorded in 2018 includes property insurance proceeds totaling $9.6 million.\nInterest expense and interest income. Interest expense was $0.3 million in 2019 compared to $0.5 million in 2018. Interest expense in 2019 and 2018 principally consists of fees on the unused portion of the credit facility. Interest income decreased to $1.9 million in 2019 compared to $2.4 million in 2018 due to lower investable cash balances.\nIncome tax (benefit) provision. The income tax benefit was $26.0 million in 2019 compared to a provision of $45.9 million in 2018. The effective tax rate was 23.0 percent in 2019 compared to 20.7 percent in 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2019 is due primarily to certain state taxes based on revenues rather than taxable income or losses and unfavorable discrete adjustments in 2019 compared to 2018.\nNet (loss) income and diluted (loss) earnings per share. Net loss was $87.1 million in 2019, or $0.41 loss per diluted share, compared to net income of $175.4 million in 2018, or $0.82 earnings per diluted share. This decrease in earnings per share was due to lower profitability as average shares outstanding was essentially unchanged.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenues. Revenues in 2018 increased $125.8 million or 7.9 percent compared to 2017. The Technical Services segment revenues in 2018 increased $108.9 million or 7.1 percent compared to the prior year. The increase is due primarily to higher activity levels and improved pricing in a few of our services lines as compared to the prior year. The Support Services segment revenues in 2018 increased $16.9 million or 29.7 percent compared to 2017 due primarily to improved activity levels and pricing in the rental tool service line, which is the largest service line within this segment. Technical Services reported an operating profit of $216.7 million during 2018 compared to $251.5 million in the prior year, while Support Services reported an operating income of $4.6 million in 2018 compared to an operating loss of $12.2 million in the prior year. The average price of oil increased 27.9 percent while the average price of natural gas increased 6.4 percent during 2018 compared to the prior year. The average domestic rig count during 2018 was 17.7 percent higher than 2017. International revenues, which increased from $55.9 million in 2017 to $90.4 million in 2018, were five percent of consolidated revenues in 2018 compared to four percent of consolidated revenues in 2017. International revenues increased primarily due to higher customer activity levels in Argentina and to a lesser extent, Mexico and Pakistan in 2018, partially offset by lower activity in Gabon compared to the prior year. Our international revenues are impacted by the timing of project initiation and their ultimate duration.\nCost of revenues. Cost of revenues in 2018 was $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion in 2017, an increase of $132.2 million or 12.6 percent due to higher employment costs, maintenance and repair expenses and other costs, all of which were driven by higher activity levels. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased to 68.7 percent in 2018 compared to 65.9 percent in 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5.6 percent to $168.2 million in 2018 compared to $159.2 million in 2017. These expenses increased due to higher salaries and wages expense consistent with higher activity levels as well as an increase in information technology costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly to 9.8 percent of revenues in 2018 compared to 10.0 percent of revenues in 2017 due to the leverage of higher revenues over primarily fixed expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization were $163.1 million in 2018, a decrease of $0.4 million, compared to $163.5 million in 2017 due to lower capital expenditures in the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher revenues.\nGain on disposition of assets, net. Gain on disposition of assets, net was $3.3 million in 2018 compared to $4.5 million in 2017. The decrease is due to the sale of operating equipment related to its oilfield pipe inspection service line during the second quarter of 2017 that did not recur in the current period. The gain on disposition of assets, net is generally comprised of gains or losses related to various property and equipment dispositions or sales to customers of lost or damaged rental equipment.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income, net was $9.3 million in 2018 compared to of $5.5 million in 2017. Other income recorded in 2018 includes property insurance proceeds totaling $9.6 million. Income recorded in 2017 included a favorable settlement of $2.0 million associated with the resolution of a sales tax matter, as well as a property insurance proceeds of $1.9 million.\nInterest expense and interest income. Interest expense increased to $0.5 million in 2018 compared to $0.4 million in 2017. Interest expense in 2018 and 2017 principally consists of fees on the unused portion of the credit facility. Interest income increased to $2.4 million in 2018 compared to $1.5 million in 2017 due to higher investable cash balances.\nIncome tax provision (benefit). The income tax provision was $45.9 million in 2018 compared to $70.3 million in 2017. The effective tax rate was 20.7 percent in 2018 compared to 30.2 percent in 2017. The decrease in the income tax provision for 2018 primarily reflects the decrease in Federal income tax rates from 35 percent to 21 percent as enacted by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nNet income and diluted earnings per share. Net income was $175.4 million in 2018, or $0.82 earnings per diluted share, compared to $162.5 million in 2017, or $0.75 earnings per diluted share. This improvement in earnings per share was due to higher net income as average shares outstanding was essentially unchanged.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and Cash Flows\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents were $50.0 million as of December 31, 2019, $116.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and $91.1 million as of December 31, 2017.\nThe following table sets forth the historical cash flows for the years ended December 31:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 209,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 389,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 133,704\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (235,788)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (219,727)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (104,386)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (39,592)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (144,070)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (70,103)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash provided by operating activities in 2019 decreased by $179.9 million compared to the prior year. This decrease is due primarily to a decrease in net income (loss) of $262.5 million, the deferred income tax benefit of $22.2 million and gains due to benefit plan financing arrangement in 2018. These decreases were partially offset by a net favorable change in working capital of $24.9 million. The net favorable change in working capital is primarily due to favorable changes of $27.1 million in accounts receivable due to lower activity levels and revenues in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and $36.6 million in inventories due to lower activity levels. These favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable working capital changes of $34.5 million in accounts payable and $8.3 million in accrued payroll and related expenses.\nCash used for investing activities in 2019 increased by $16.1 million compared to 2018 primarily because of higher capital expenditures in 2019 and property insurance proceeds in 2018.\nCash used for financing activities in 2019 decreased by $104.5 million primarily as a result of a reduction in cash dividends to common stockholders, partially offset by the lower cost of repurchases of the Company's shares on both the open market and for taxes related to the vesting of restricted shares.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2018 increased by $255.3 million compared to the prior year. This increase is due primarily to an increase in net income of $12.9 million, net favorable changes in working capital of $196.7 million and the deferred income tax provision of $64.0 million partially offset by gains due to an insurance recovery and a benefit plan financing arrangement. The net favorable change in working capital is primarily due to favorable changes of $262.6 million in accounts receivable due to lower activity levels and revenues in the third and fourth quarters 2018, $4.3 million in accrued expenses and $6.1 million in prepaid expenses/ other current assets. These favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable working capital changes of $9.3 million in net income taxes receivable/ payable, $9.4 million in inventories, $36.9 million in accounts payable, $11.1 million in accrued state and local taxes and $9.2 million in accrued payroll and related expenses.\nCash used for investing activities in 2018 increased by $115.3 million, compared to 2017, primarily because of higher capital expenditures partially offset by property insurance proceeds.\nCash used for financing activities in 2018 increased by $74.0 million primarily as a result of increased cash dividends to common stockholders coupled with the higher cost of repurchases of the Company's shares on the open market and for taxes related to the vesting of restricted shares.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nThe Company's financial condition as of December 31, 2019 remains strong. We believe the liquidity provided by our existing cash and cash equivalents and our overall strong capitalization will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months. The Company currently has a $125 million revolving credit facility that matures in July 2023. The facility contains customary terms and conditions, including restrictions on indebtedness, dividend payments, business combinations and other related items. On July 26, 2018, the Company amended the revolving credit facility to, among other matters, (1) replace the existing minimum tangible net worth covenant, as well as, (2) extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to July 26, 2023, (3) eliminate any borrowing base limitations on revolving loans when certain criteria exist, (4) reduce the commitment fees payable by RPC and (5) reduce the letter of credit sublimit from $50 million to $35 million. As of December 31, 2019, RPC had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and letters of credit outstanding relating to self-insurance programs and contract bids totaled $19.5 million; therefore, a total of $105.5 million of the facility was available. For additional information with respect to RPC's facility, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nThe Company's decisions about the amount of cash to be used for investing and financing purposes are influenced by its capital position, including the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations and access to borrowings under our facility. We believe our liquidity will continue to provide the opportunity to grow our asset base and revenues during periods with positive business conditions and strong customer activity levels. In addition, the Company's decisions about the amount of cash to be used for investing and financing activities may also be influenced by the financial covenants in our credit facility but we do not expect the covenants to restrict our planned activities. The Company is in compliance with these financial covenants.\nCash Requirements\nCapital expenditures were $250.6 million in 2019, and we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately $80 million in 2020. We expect that a majority of these expenditures in 2020 will be directed towards capitalized maintenance of our existing equipment. The actual amount of capital expenditures will depend primarily on equipment maintenance requirements, expansion opportunities, and equipment delivery schedules.\nThe Company's Retirement Income Plan, a multiple employer trusteed defined benefit pension plan, provides monthly benefits upon retirement at age 65 to eligible employees. During 2019, the Company did not make any contributions to the plan and does not expect to make any contributions to the plan during 2020.\nThe Company has a stock buyback program, initially adopted in 1998 and subsequently amended in 2013 and 2018, that authorizes the repurchase of up to 41,578,125 shares. On February 12, 2018, the Board of Directors increased the number of shares authorized for repurchase by 10 million shares. There were 595,585 shares repurchased on the open market by the Company during 2019, and 8,248,184 shares remain available to be repurchased under the current authorization as of December 31, 2019. The Company may repurchase outstanding common shares periodically based on market conditions and our capital allocation strategies considering restrictions under our credit facility. The stock buyback program does not have a predetermined expiration date.\nThe Company recorded impairment and other charges of $82.3 million during 2019, of which $8.7 million is expected to have a cash impact during 2020.\nOn July 22, 2019, the Board of Directors voted to suspend RPC's dividend to common stockholders. The Company expects to resume cash dividends to common stockholders, subject to the earnings and financial condition of the Company and other relevant factors. The Company has no timetable for the resumption of dividends.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company's obligations and commitments that require future payments include our credit facility, certain non-cancelable operating leases, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. The following table summarizes the Company's significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,132\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 56,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 20,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 19,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 9,132\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Operating leases include agreements for various office locations, office equipment, and certain operating equipment.\n(2)Includes agreements to purchase raw materials, goods or services that have been approved and that specify all significant terms (pricing, quantity, and timing). As part of the normal course of business the Company occasionally enters into purchase commitments to manage its various operating needs.\n(3)Includes expected cash payments for long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet where the timing of the payments is known. These amounts include incentive compensation, severance costs and estimated charges related to disposal of impaired assets. Also includes amounts related to the usage of corporate aircraft. These amounts exclude pension obligations with uncertain funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in the fair value hierarchy (Level 1, 2 or 3) based on the inputs used for valuation. Assets and liabilities that are traded on an exchange with a quoted price are classified as Level 1. Assets and liabilities that are valued using significant observable inputs in addition to quoted market prices are classified as Level 2. The Company currently has no assets or liabilities measured on a recurring basis that are valued using unobservable inputs and therefore no assets or liabilities measured on a recurring basis are classified as Level 3. For defined benefit plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ( SERP\u201d) investments measured at net asset value, the values are computed using inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data or on net asset values calculated by the fund when not publicly available.\nInflation\nThe Company purchases its equipment and materials from suppliers who provide competitive prices, and employs skilled workers from competitive labor markets. If inflation in the general economy increases, the Company's costs for equipment, materials and labor could increase as well. In addition, increases in activity in the domestic oilfield can cause upward wage pressures in the labor markets from which it hires employees, especially if employment in the general economy increases. Also, activity increases can cause increases in the costs of certain materials and key equipment components used to provide services to the Company's customers. When oilfield activity began to increase in the third quarter of 2016, the Company experienced upward pressure on the price of labor due to the shortage of skilled employees as well as occasional increases in the prices of certain raw materials used in providing our services. During 2018, however, prices for the raw material comprising the Company's single largest raw material purchase began to decline due to increased sources of supply of the material, particularly in geographic markets located close to the largest U.S. oil and gas basin. In addition, labor cost pressures during the fourth quarter of 2018 began to abate due to lower oilfield activity. These cost pressures continued to decline during 2019.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements.\nRelated Party Transactions\nMarine Products Corporation\nEffective in 2001, the Company spun off the business conducted through Chaparral Boats, Inc. ( Chaparral\u201d), RPC's former powerboat manufacturing segment. RPC accomplished the spin-off by contributing 100 percent of the issued and outstanding stock of Chaparral to Marine Products Corporation (a Delaware corporation) ( Marine Products\u201d), a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of RPC, and then distributing the common stock of Marine Products to RPC stockholders. In conjunction with the spin-off, RPC and Marine Products entered into various agreements that define the companies' relationship.\nIn accordance with a Transition Support Services agreement, which may be terminated by either party, RPC provides certain administrative services, including financial reporting and income tax administration, acquisition assistance, etc., to Marine Products. Charges from the Company (or from corporations that are subsidiaries of the Company) for such services were $865,000 in 2019, $873,000 in 2018, and $849,000 in 2017. The Company's receivable due from Marine Products for these services was $55,000 as of December 31, 2019 and $28,000 as of December 31, 2018. Many of the Company's directors are also directors of Marine Products and all of the executive officers are employees of both the Company and Marine Products.\nOther\nThe Company periodically purchases in the ordinary course of business equipment or services from suppliers, who are owned by significant officers or stockholders, or affiliated with the directors of RPC. The total amounts paid to these affiliated parties were $1,625,000 in 2019, $1,467,000 in 2018 and $1,372,000 in 2017.\nRPC receives certain administrative services and rents office space from Rollins, Inc. (a company of which Mr. R. Randall Rollins is also Chairman and which is otherwise affiliated with RPC). The service agreements between Rollins, Inc. and the Company provide for the provision of services on a cost reimbursement basis and are terminable on six months' notice. The services covered by these agreements include office space, administration of certain employee benefit programs, and other administrative services. Charges to the Company (or to corporations which are subsidiaries of the Company) for such services and rent totaled $104,000 in 2019, $101,000 in 2018 and $104,000 in 2017.\nA group that includes the Company's Chairman of the Board, R. Randall Rollins and his brother Gary W. Rollins, who is also a director of the Company, and certain companies under their control, controls in excess of fifty percent of the Company's voting power.\nRPC and Marine Products own 50 percent each of a limited liability company called 255 RC, LLC that was created for the joint purchase and ownership of a corporate aircraft. The purchase of the aircraft was completed in January 2015, and the purchase was funded primarily by a $2,554,000 contribution by each company to 255 RC, LLC. Each of RPC and Marine Products is currently a party to an operating lease agreement with 255 RC, LLC for a period of five years. RPC recorded certain net operating costs comprised of rent and an allocable share of fixed costs of $199,000 in 2019 and 2018 and $197,000 in 2017 for the corporate aircraft. The Company has a payable to 255 RC, LLC of $1.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and $0.8 million as of December 31, 2018. The Company accounts for this investment using the equity method and its proportionate share of income or loss is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2019, the investment closely approximates the underlying equity in the net assets of 255 RC, LLC.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating accounting estimates. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, trends in the industry, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies involve estimates that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity:\nAllowance for doubtful accounts - Substantially all of the Company's receivables are due from oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States, selected international locations and foreign, nationally owned oil companies. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our receivables are not overstated due to uncollectibility. Our established credit evaluation procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers. Our customers' ability to pay is directly related to their ability to generate cash flow on their projects and is significantly affected by the volatility in the price of oil and natural gas. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that amounts are uncollectible and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when collected. Significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the period of recovery. Therefore, the provision for doubtful accounts can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Recoveries were insignificant in 2019, 2018 and 2017. We record specific provisions when we become aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If circumstances related to a customer changes, our estimate of the realizability of the receivable would be further adjusted, either upward or downward.\nThe estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our evaluation of the overall trends in the oil and gas industry, financial condition of our customers, our historical write-off experience, current economic conditions, and in the case of international customers, our judgments about the economic and political environment of the related country and region. In addition to reserves established for specific customers, we establish general reserves by using different percentages depending on the age of the receivables which we adjust periodically based on management judgment and the economic strength of our customers. The net provisions for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenues ranged from 0.03 percent to 0.8 percent over the last three years. Increasing or decreasing the estimated general reserve percentages by 0.50 percentage points as of December 31, 2019 would have resulted in a change of $1.1 million to the allowance for doubtful accounts and a corresponding change to selling, general and administrative expenses.\nIncome taxes - The effective income tax benefits were 23.0 percent in 2019, compared to an income tax provision of 20.7 percent in 2018 and 30.2 percent in 2017. Our effective tax rates vary due to changes in estimates of our future taxable income or losses, fluctuations in the tax jurisdictions in which our earnings and deductions are realized, and favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities related to proposed or probable assessments. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis. The effective tax rate for 2019 reflects the decrease in favorable discrete adjustments, along with a higher percentage of permanent adjustments compared to income (loss).\nThe Company establishes a valuation allowance against the carrying value of deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized through future taxable income. Such amounts are charged to earnings in the period the determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance is reversed. The Company considers future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance.\nThe Company calculates the current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified, which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for U.S. federal and state provisions. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the year the differences are expected to reverse. In 2017, the Company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the change in Federal income tax rates, as required by the TCJA. All deferred tax assets and liabilities from December 31, 2017 forward reflect the changed rate.\nThe amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. The Company believes it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates.\nInsurance expenses -The Company self-insures, up to certain policy-specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation, vehicle and equipment liability. The cost of claims under these self-insurance programs is estimated and accrued using individual case-based valuations and statistical analysis and is based upon judgment and historical experience; however, the ultimate cost of many of these claims may not be known for several years. These claims are monitored and the cost estimates are revised as developments occur relating to such claims. The Company has retained an independent third party actuary to assist in the calculation of a range of exposure for these claims. As of December 31, 2019, the Company estimates the range of exposure to be from $19.0 million to $24.2 million. The Company has recorded liabilities at December 31, 2019 of $21.6 million which represents management's best estimate of probable loss.\nDepreciable life of assets - RPC's net property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2019 was $516.7 million representing 49.1 percent of the Company's consolidated assets. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $170.4 million. Management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated useful lives used to calculate the annual and accumulated depreciation and amortization expense.\nProperty, plant and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the Company and is determined by management based on many factors including historical experience with similar assets. Assets are monitored to ensure changes in asset lives are identified and prospective depreciation and amortization expense is adjusted accordingly. We did not make any changes to the estimated lives of assets resulting in a material impact in 2019 or 2018.\nLong-lived assets including goodwill - RPC carries a variety of long-lived assets on our balance sheet including property, plant and equipment and goodwill. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company conducts impairment tests on goodwill annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. In addition, the Company conducts impairment tests on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nFor the impairment testing on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, a long-lived asset is grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group are compared to its carrying amount. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying amount, then the Company is required to determine the asset group's fair value by using a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis is based on estimates such as management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance, including revenue growth rates and expected profitability margins, estimates of the remaining useful life and service potential of the assets within the asset group, and a discount rate based on weighted average cost of capital. An impairment loss is measured and recorded as the amount by which the asset group's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Assessment of goodwill impairment is conducted at the level of each reporting unit, which is the same as our reportable segments, Technical Services and Support Services, comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using an income approach and a market approach. The income approach uses discounted cash flow analysis based on management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance. This analysis includes significant assumptions regarding discount rates, revenue growth rates, expected profitability margins, forecasted capital expenditures and the timing of expected future cash flows based on market conditions. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recorded.\nThe impairment assessments discussed above incorporate inherent uncertainties, including projected commodity pricing, supply and demand for the Company's services and future market conditions, which are difficult to predict in volatile economic environments and could result in impairment charges in future periods if actual results materially differ from the estimated assumptions utilized in our forecasts. If market conditions further deteriorate, including crude oil prices significantly declining and remaining at low levels for a sustained period of time, we could be required to record additional impairments of the carrying value of our long-lived assets in the future which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nDefined benefit pension plan - In 2002, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the defined benefit plan, although the Company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through March 2002. The Company accounts for the defined benefit plan in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits\u201d and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.\nThe Company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the investments strategy, and the views of our investment advisor. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years. Therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains (losses) ultimately affects future pension expense. The Company's assumption for the expected return on plan assets was seven percent for 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nThe discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company utilizes a yield curve approach. The approach utilizes an economic model whereby the Company's expected benefit payments over the life of the plan are forecasted and then compared to a portfolio of investment grade corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. The economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations. The discount rate was 3.60 percent as of December 31, 2019 compared to 4.65 percent as of December 31, 2018 and 4.00 percent in 2017.\nAs set forth in Note 12 to the Company's financial statements, included among the asset categories for the Plan's investments are real estate and alternative/ opportunistic/ special fund investments comprised of real estate funds and private equity funds. These investments are measured at net asset value and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds' judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds' financial statements for reasonableness.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the defined benefit plan was under-funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased stockholders' equity by $3.0 million after tax. Holding all other factors constant, a change in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 0.25 percentage points would result in a pre-tax increase or decrease of $1.3 million to the net loss related to pension reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nThe Company recognized pre-tax pension expense (income) of $0.3 million in 2019, $(0.2) million in 2018 and $0.4 million in 2017. Based on the under-funded status of the defined benefit plan as of December 31, 2019, the Company expects to recognize pension income of $15 thousand in 2020. Holding all other factors constant, a change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 0.50 percentage points would result in an increase or decrease in pension expense of $194 thousand in 2020. Holding all other factors constant, a change in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 0.25 percentage points would result in an increase or decrease in pension expense of $19 thousand in 2020.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued the following applicable Accounting Standards Updates (ASU):\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards:\n \u25cf Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The Company adopted ASC 842, Leases, and all the related amendments on January 1, 2019, by recognizing on its balance sheet, a right-of-use asset and lease liabilities totaling approximately $44 million, for all of its leases with terms greater than 12 months. The Company adopted the standard using the optional transition method, with an immaterial adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards that were in effect for those periods. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows. See Leases\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for expanded disclosures \n \u25cf ASU No. 2018-02-Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)-Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The amendments provide an option to reclassify stranded tax effects within AOCI to retained earnings in each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recorded. The Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019 and elected to reclassify approximately $2.7 million of stranded tax effects related to its pension plan from AOCI to retained earnings. \n \u25cf ASU No. 2018-07 -Compensation -Stock Compensation (Topic 718) -Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments expand the scope of ASU 718 to include share-based payments issued to nonemployees for goods or services, thereby substantially aligning the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees and employees. The Company adopted these provisions in the first quarter of 2019 and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. \nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted:\nTo be adopted in 2020 and later:\n \u25cf ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments -Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. The ASU introduced a new accounting model, the Current Expected Credit Losses model (CECL), which requires earlier recognition of credit losses and additional disclosures related to credit risk. The CECL model utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for recognition in place of the current incurred loss model. The Company adopted the provisions of the standard in the first quarter of 2020 and currently expects the adoption to have an immaterial cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Company plans to continue to record an allowance on its trade receivables based on aging at the end of each reporting period using current reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions. \n \u25cf ASU No. 2017-04 -Intangibles -Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the amendments eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company adopted these provisions in the first quarter of 2020, on a prospective basis. \n \u25cf ASU No. 2018-15 -Intangibles -Goodwill and Other -Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. The amendments reduce the complexity for the accounting for costs of implementing a cloud computing service arrangement and align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs that are incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The Company adopted these provisions in the first quarter of 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. \n \u25cf ASU No. 2019-12 - Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in this ASU simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing the exceptions to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation in certain situations, requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for a change in the status of a foreign investment, and the general methodology for computing income taxes in an interim period when year-to date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. The amendments also simplify the accounting for income taxes with regard to franchise tax, evaluation of step up in the tax basis goodwill in certain business combinations, allocating current and deferred tax expense to legal entities that are not subject to tax and enacted change in tax laws or rates. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these provisions on its consolidated financial statements. ", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data\u201d and the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document. See also Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 2.\nRPC, Inc. ( RPC\u201d) provides a broad range of specialized oilfield services primarily to independent and major oilfield companies engaged in exploration, production and development of oil and gas properties throughout the United States, including the southwest, mid-continent, Gulf of Mexico, Rocky Mountain and Appalachian regions, and in selected international markets. The Company's revenues and profits are generated by providing equipment and services to customers who operate oil and gas properties and invest capital to drill new wells and enhance production or perform maintenance on existing wells.\nOur key business and financial strategies are:\n - To focus our management resources on and invest our capital in equipment and geographic markets that we believe will earn high returns on capital. \n - To maintain a flexible cost structure that can respond quickly to volatile industry conditions and business activity levels. \n - To maintain an efficient, low-cost capital structure which includes an appropriate use of debt financing. \n - To optimize asset utilization with the goal of increasing revenues and generating leverage of direct and overhead costs, balanced against increasingly high maintenance requirements and low financial returns experienced during times of low customer pricing for our services. \n - To deliver product and services to our customers safely. \n - To secure adequate sources of supplies of certain high-demand raw materials used in our operations, both in order to conduct our operations and to enhance our competitive position. \n - To maintain and selectively increase market share. \n - To maximize stockholder return by optimizing the balance between cash invested in the Company's productive assets, the payment of dividends to stockholders, and the repurchase of our common stock on the open market. \n - To align the interests of our management and stockholders. \nIn assessing the outcomes of these strategies and RPC's financial condition and operating performance, management generally reviews periodic forecast data, monthly actual results, and other similar information. We also consider trends related to certain key financial data, including revenues, utilization of our equipment and personnel, maintenance and repair expenses, pricing for our services and equipment, profit margins, selling, general and administrative expenses, cash flows and the return on our invested capital. Additionally, we compare our trends to those of our peers. We continuously monitor factors that impact current and expected customer activity levels, such as the price of oil and natural gas, changes in pricing for our services and equipment and utilization of our equipment and personnel. Our financial results are affected by geopolitical factors such as political instability in the petroleum-producing regions of the world, overall economic conditions and weather in the United States, the prices of oil and natural gas, and our customers' drilling and production activities.\nCurrent industry conditions are characterized by oil prices which have fallen from a cyclical peak of $75 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2018 to $53 per barrel in the first quarter of 2020. In spite of this significant decrease in the price of oil, the U.S. domestic rig count and well completion counts have not fallen significantly during the fourth quarter of 2019 and into the first quarter of 2020. However, many of our customers indicate that they are curtailing or delaying their drilling and completion plans early in 2020, and we believe that this will have a negative impact on RPC's revenues and earnings during the near term. One catalyst for the recent decrease in the price of oil relates to global supply and demand for the commodity. Early in 2020, a potential slowdown in economic growth is perceived to be a catalyst for lower oil prices, a factor which is exacerbated by continued growth in oil production, particularly in the United States. RPC believes that oil production in the United States has also become an increasingly important determinant of global oil prices, because the United States grew to be the world's largest producer of oil during the second quarter of 2016. Following its recent peak, U.S. oil production fell by 25 percent as of the third quarter of 2017. Since that time, however, improving drilling and completion activity have caused U.S. domestic oil production to rise, and as of the most recent monthly reported statistics, current U.S. oil production has increased to a level that is 42 percent higher than the cyclical low production recorded during the third quarter of 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2018, U.S. oil production rose to its highest level on record. We believe that record U.S. oil production is a catalyst for lower oil prices during the near term. Customer activities directed towards natural gas drilling and production have been weak for several years, with the U.S. domestic natural gas rig count during the first quarter of 2017 falling to the lowest level ever recorded. The U.S. domestic natural gas rig count has increased from this historic low but is still low by historical standards. We believe that customer activities directed towards drilling for natural gas has been weak because of the high production of shale-directed natural gas wells, the high amount of natural gas production associated with oil-directed shale wells in the U.S. domestic market, and relatively constant consumption of natural gas in the United States. We believe that these factors will continue to depress natural gas-directed drilling during the near term. From a low of $1.72 per Mcf during the second quarter of 2017, the price of natural gas had risen to $1.95 per Mcf early in the first quarter of 2020. While current natural gas prices are higher than at the recent cyclical trough, we believe that they are still too low to encourage our customers to conduct exploration and production activities directed exclusively towards natural gas.\nIn 2019, the Company's strategy of utilizing equipment in unconventional basins has continued. During 2019, we made capital expenditures totaling $250.6 million primarily for new revenue-producing equipment and capitalized maintenance of our existing equipment.\nRevenues during 2019 totaled $1.2 billion, a decrease of 29.0 percent compared to 2018 primarily as a result of lower activity levels and lower pricing for certain service lines. Cost of revenues decreased $263.5 million in 2019 compared to the prior year due to lower employment costs, maintenance and repairs expenses, materials and supplies expense and other costs, all of which were driven by lower activity levels. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased to 75.2 percent in 2019 compared to 68.7 percent in 2018.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 13.8 percent in 2019 compared to 9.8 percent in 2018 due to lower revenues over primarily fixed expenses.\nImpairment and other charges were $82.3 million in 2019, primarily due to equipment disposals, closing operating locations and reducing employee staffing.\nLoss before income taxes was $113.1 million for 2019 compared to income before income taxes of $221.3 million in 2018. Net loss for 2019 was $87.1 million, or $0.41 loss per share compared to net income of $175.4 million, or $0.82 earnings per share in 2018. Net income in 2019 and 2018 reflect the lower income tax rates as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017.\nCash flows from operating activities decreased to $209.1 million in 2019 compared to $389.0 million in 2018 primarily due to lower earnings, partially offset by a favorable changes in working capital. As of December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility.\nOutlook\nDrilling activity in the U.S. domestic oilfields, as measured by the rotary drilling rig count, reached a cyclical peak of 1,931 during the third quarter of 2014. Between the third quarter of 2014 and the second quarter of 2016, the drilling rig count fell by 79 percent. During the second quarter of 2016, the U.S. domestic drilling rig count reached the lowest level ever recorded. The principal catalyst for this steep rig count decline was the decrease in the price of oil in the world markets, which began in the third quarter of 2014. The price of oil began to fall at that time due to the perceived oversupply of oil, weak global demand growth, and the strength of the U.S. dollar on world currency markets. During the second quarter of 2016, the price of oil and the U.S. domestic rig count began to increase, and increased steadily throughout the remainder of 2016, 2017 and 2018. At the end of 2019, the U.S. domestic rig count had fallen by approximately 26 percent compared with the end of 2018. RPC monitors rig count efficiencies and well completion trends because the majority of our services are directed toward well completions. Improvements in drilling rig efficiencies have increased the number of potential well completions for a given drilling rig count; therefore, we believe the statistics regarding well completions are more meaningful indicators of the outlook for RPC's activity levels and revenues. Annual well completions in the U.S. completions\nincreased by approximately 30 percent to 14,655 in 2018 compared to 11,277 in 2017, and by approximately seven percent to 15,734 during 2019. However, we believe that U.S. oilfield well completion activity will decline during the near term.\nThe current and projected prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are important catalysts for U.S. domestic drilling activity. During the first two quarters of 2016, the prices of oil and natural gas remained at low levels that discouraged our customers from undertaking most of their potential exploration and production activities. The prices of oil and natural gas increased during the third and fourth quarters of 2016, throughout 2017 and continued during 2018. The price of natural gas declined during 2019 and we do not believe that it is at a level that encourages our customers to increase their natural gas directed drilling and production activities. The price of oil began to increase during 2019, and at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 was approximately 35 percent higher than at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018. The average price of natural gas liquids in 2019 decreased by 19.2 percent compared to the average price for the full year 2018.\nThe majority of the U.S. domestic rig count remains directed towards oil. At the beginning of 2020, approximately 85 percent of the U.S. domestic rig count was directed towards oil, a slight increase compared to the prior year. We believe that oil-directed drilling will remain the majority of domestic drilling, and that natural gas-directed drilling will remain a low percentage of U.S. domestic drilling in the near term. We believe that this relationship will continue due to relatively low prices for natural gas, high production from existing natural gas wells, and industry projections of limited increases in domestic natural gas demand during the near term.\nWe continue to monitor the market for our services and the competitive environment. The U.S. domestic rig count had increased sharply since the historical low recorded during the third quarter of 2016 and continuing until the fourth quarter of 2018, though the rig count has declined during 2019. The fact that drilling and completion activities continue to be highly service-intensive and require a large amount of equipment and raw materials carries favorable implications for our activity levels. Furthermore, we note that some wells in the U.S. domestic market have been drilled but not completed. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2019, the number of wells in this category had decreased by approximately ten percent since the beginning of 2019. These moderately positive economic factors are offset by indications from our customers that they intend to reduce drilling and completion activity during 2020 because they are managing their operations to maximize near-term cash flow. Also, during 2018, we began to observe that oilfield completion crews and equipment were providing services with increasing efficiency, and we believe that this higher efficiency has caused the market for several oilfield completion services, including pressure pumping, to become oversupplied. This trend continued during 2019, and we believe that this development carries negative consequences for pricing of our services, utilization of our equipment and our financial results during the near term.\nActivity levels and pricing for oilfield services reached a level during 2018 that allowed the industry to maintain its equipment and encouraged oilfield service providers to expand their fleets of revenue-producing equipment and hire additional personnel. The prospect of improved financial returns also provided access to the capital markets and allowed previously insolvent service companies to resume operations and add equipment. As a result, competition increased during 2018. Increased competition and improved service efficiency, coupled with the significant decline in oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2018, became catalysts for lower pricing and activity levels in 2019. RPC expanded the size of its fleet of revenue-producing equipment modestly during 2018 and placed orders in the latter part of 2018 for a small amount of new equipment that was delivered in 2019. The equipment we placed in service in 2018 and 2019 is more powerful and efficient than earlier generations of oilfield service equipment, and we believe that it will produce acceptable financial returns as it is placed in service at high utilization levels. Our consistent response to the near-term potential of lower activity levels and pricing is to undertake moderate fleet expansions which we believe will allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet, even if near-term pricing and activity levels generated by such new equipment are modest.\nThe negative implications for RPC's near-term activity levels from low oil prices and increased competition are partially offset by improved availability and lower cost for some of the critical raw materials used in providing RPC's services. In addition, lower activity levels reduce the cost, and increase the availability of, skilled labor. These factors may reduce the cost of providing RPC's services and reduce logistical constraints.\nThe Company recorded impairment and other charges in 2019 of $82.3 million primarily related to equipment disposals, closing operating locations and reducing employee staffing. We made operational decisions resulting in these impairments and other charges because the U.S. oilfield has undergone fundamental changes in the past few years. These changes require equipment which is capable of operating continuously, over long periods of time, and much of our older equipment is not able to fulfill this requirement, no matter how well maintained. We believe that the oilfield will require less pressure pumping equipment in the foreseeable future based on the fact that U.S. oil production has reached record levels while not fully utilizing the pressure pumping capacity that has been available during the period. In addition, we are aware that our customers have been forced to conduct their operations with little or no access to outside capital for the first time in many years, and we assume that this aspect of exploration and production financing will remain in place for the foreseeable future, thereby reducing the volume of future drilling and completion of new wells.\nResults of Operations\n\n(1)Amount in 2019 represents $80,263 related to technical services and $2,010 related to corporate services.\n(2)The indicated data for 2017 includes the impact of a net discrete tax benefit of $19.3 million, or $0.09 per share, recorded as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nRevenues. Revenues in 2019 decreased $498.6 million or 29.0 percent compared to 2018. The Technical Services segment revenues in 2019 decreased $501.7 million or 30.5 percent compared to the prior year. The decrease is due primarily to lower activity levels and lower pricing in several of our service lines as compared to the prior year. The Support Services segment revenues in 2019 increased $3.1 million or 4.2 percent compared to 2018 due primarily to improved activity levels and pricing in the rental tools service line, which is the largest service line within this segment. Technical Services reported an operating loss of $33.0 million during 2019 compared to a profit of $216.7 million in the prior year, while Support Services reported an operating income of $10.0 million in 2019 compared to $4.6 million in the prior year. The average price of oil decreased 12.5 percent and the average price of natural gas decreased 19.2 percent during 2019 compared to the prior year. The average domestic rig count during 2019 was 8.6 percent lower than 2018. International revenues, which decreased from $90.4 million in 2018 to $64.6 million in 2019, were five percent of consolidated revenues in both 2019 and 2018. International revenues decreased in 2019 primarily due to lower customer activity levels in Argentina and to a lesser extent, Canada and Gabon, partially offset by higher activity in Algeria compared to the prior year. Our international revenues are impacted by the timing of project initiation and their ultimate duration.\nCost of revenues. Cost of revenues in 2019 was $919.6 million compared to $1.2 billion in 2018, a decrease of $22.3 percent due to lower employment costs, maintenance and repair expenses, materials and supplies expense and other costs, all of which were driven by lower activity levels. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased to 75.2 percent in 2019 compared to 68.7 percent in 2018 primarily due to lower activity levels and more competitive pricing.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to $168.1 million in 2019 compared to $168.2 million in 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 13.8 percent of revenues in 2019 compared to 9.8 percent of revenues in 2018 due to the negative leverage of lower revenues over primarily fixed expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization were $170.4 million in 2019, an increase of $7.3 million, compared to $163.1 million in 2018 due to capital expenditures made during 2019. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower revenues.\nImpairment and other charges. Impairment and other charges were $82.3 million in 2019, primarily due to equipment disposals, closing operating locations and reducing employee staffing.\nGain on disposition of assets, net. Gain on disposition of assets, net was $3.7 million in 2019 compared to $3.3 million in 2018. The gain on disposition of assets, net is generally comprised of gains or losses related to various property and equipment dispositions or sales to customers of lost or damaged rental equipment.\nOther (expense) income, net. Other expense, net was $0.4 million in 2019 compared to other income, net of $9.3 million in 2018. Other income recorded in 2018 includes property insurance proceeds totaling $9.6 million.\nInterest expense and interest income. Interest expense was $0.3 million in 2019 compared to $0.5 million in 2018. Interest expense in 2019 and 2018 principally consists of fees on the unused portion of the credit facility. Interest income decreased to $1.9 million in 2019 compared to $2.4 million in 2018 due to lower investable cash balances.\nIncome tax (benefit) provision. The income tax benefit was $26.0 million in 2019 compared to a provision of $45.9 million in 2018. The effective tax rate was 23.0 percent in 2019 compared to 20.7 percent in 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2019 is due primarily to certain state taxes based on revenues rather than taxable income or losses and unfavorable discrete adjustments in 2019 compared to 2018.\nNet (loss) income and diluted (loss) earnings per share. Net loss was $87.1 million in 2019, or $0.41 loss per diluted share, compared to net income of $175.4 million in 2018, or $0.82 earnings per diluted share. This decrease in earnings per share was due to lower profitability as average shares outstanding was essentially unchanged.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenues. Revenues in 2018 increased $125.8 million or 7.9 percent compared to 2017. The Technical Services segment revenues in 2018 increased $108.9 million or 7.1 percent compared to the prior year. The increase is due primarily to higher activity levels and improved pricing in a few of our services lines as compared to the prior year. The Support Services segment revenues in 2018 increased $16.9 million or 29.7 percent compared to 2017 due primarily to improved activity levels and pricing in the rental tool service line, which is the largest service line within this segment. Technical Services reported an operating profit of $216.7 million during 2018 compared to $251.5 million in the prior year, while Support Services reported an operating income of $4.6 million in 2018 compared to an operating loss of $12.2 million in the prior year. The average price of oil increased 27.9 percent while the average price of natural gas increased 6.4 percent during 2018 compared to the prior year. The average domestic rig count during 2018 was 17.7 percent higher than 2017. International revenues, which increased from $55.9 million in 2017 to $90.4 million in 2018, were five percent of consolidated revenues in 2018 compared to four percent of consolidated revenues in 2017. International revenues increased primarily due to higher customer activity levels in Argentina and to a lesser extent, Mexico and Pakistan in 2018, partially offset by lower activity in Gabon compared to the prior year. Our international revenues are impacted by the timing of project initiation and their ultimate duration.\nCost of revenues. Cost of revenues in 2018 was $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion in 2017, an increase of $132.2 million or 12.6 percent due to higher employment costs, maintenance and repair expenses and other costs, all of which were driven by higher activity levels. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues increased to 68.7 percent in 2018 compared to 65.9 percent in 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5.6 percent to $168.2 million in 2018 compared to $159.2 million in 2017. These expenses increased due to higher salaries and wages expense consistent with higher activity levels as well as an increase in information technology costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly to 9.8 percent of revenues in 2018 compared to 10.0 percent of revenues in 2017 due to the leverage of higher revenues over primarily fixed expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization were $163.1 million in 2018, a decrease of $0.4 million, compared to $163.5 million in 2017 due to lower capital expenditures in the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to higher revenues.\nGain on disposition of assets, net. Gain on disposition of assets, net was $3.3 million in 2018 compared to $4.5 million in 2017. The decrease is due to the sale of operating equipment related to its oilfield pipe inspection service line during the second quarter of 2017 that did not recur in the current period. The gain on disposition of assets, net is generally comprised of gains or losses related to various property and equipment dispositions or sales to customers of lost or damaged rental equipment.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income, net was $9.3 million in 2018 compared to of $5.5 million in 2017. Other income recorded in 2018 includes property insurance proceeds totaling $9.6 million. Income recorded in 2017 included a favorable settlement of $2.0 million associated with the resolution of a sales tax matter, as well as a property insurance proceeds of $1.9 million.\nInterest expense and interest income. Interest expense increased to $0.5 million in 2018 compared to $0.4 million in 2017. Interest expense in 2018 and 2017 principally consists of fees on the unused portion of the credit facility. Interest income increased to $2.4 million in 2018 compared to $1.5 million in 2017 due to higher investable cash balances.\nIncome tax provision (benefit). The income tax provision was $45.9 million in 2018 compared to $70.3 million in 2017. The effective tax rate was 20.7 percent in 2018 compared to 30.2 percent in 2017. The decrease in the income tax provision for 2018 primarily reflects the decrease in Federal income tax rates from 35 percent to 21 percent as enacted by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nNet income and diluted earnings per share. Net income was $175.4 million in 2018, or $0.82 earnings per diluted share, compared to $162.5 million in 2017, or $0.75 earnings per diluted share. This improvement in earnings per share was due to higher net income as average shares outstanding was essentially unchanged.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and Cash Flows\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents were $50.0 million as of December 31, 2019, $116.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and $91.1 million as of December 31, 2017.\nThe following table sets forth the historical cash flows for the years ended December 31:\n\nCash provided by operating activities in 2019 decreased by $179.9 million compared to the prior year. This decrease is due primarily to a decrease in net income (loss) of $262.5 million, the deferred income tax benefit of $22.2 million and gains due to benefit plan financing arrangement in 2018. These decreases were partially offset by a net favorable change in working capital of $24.9 million. The net favorable change in working capital is primarily due to favorable changes of $27.1 million in accounts receivable due to lower activity levels and revenues in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and $36.6 million in inventories due to lower activity levels. These favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable working capital changes of $34.5 million in accounts payable and $8.3 million in accrued payroll and related expenses.\nCash used for investing activities in 2019 increased by $16.1 million compared to 2018 primarily because of higher capital expenditures in 2019 and property insurance proceeds in 2018.\nCash used for financing activities in 2019 decreased by $104.5 million primarily as a result of a reduction in cash dividends to common stockholders, partially offset by the lower cost of repurchases of the Company's shares on both the open market and for taxes related to the vesting of restricted shares.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2018 increased by $255.3 million compared to the prior year. This increase is due primarily to an increase in net income of $12.9 million, net favorable changes in working capital of $196.7 million and the deferred income tax provision of $64.0 million partially offset by gains due to an insurance recovery and a benefit plan financing arrangement. The net favorable change in working capital is primarily due to favorable changes of $262.6 million in accounts receivable due to lower activity levels and revenues in the third and fourth quarters 2018, $4.3 million in accrued expenses and $6.1 million in prepaid expenses/ other current assets. These favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable working capital changes of $9.3 million in net income taxes receivable/ payable, $9.4 million in inventories, $36.9 million in accounts payable, $11.1 million in accrued state and local taxes and $9.2 million in accrued payroll and related expenses.\nCash used for investing activities in 2018 increased by $115.3 million, compared to 2017, primarily because of higher capital expenditures partially offset by property insurance proceeds.\nCash used for financing activities in 2018 increased by $74.0 million primarily as a result of increased cash dividends to common stockholders coupled with the higher cost of repurchases of the Company's shares on the open market and for taxes related to the vesting of restricted shares.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nThe Company's financial condition as of December 31, 2019 remains strong. We believe the liquidity provided by our existing cash and cash equivalents and our overall strong capitalization will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months. The Company currently has a $125 million revolving credit facility that matures in July 2023. The facility contains customary terms and conditions, including restrictions on indebtedness, dividend payments, business combinations and other related items. On July 26, 2018, the Company amended the revolving credit facility to, among other matters, (1) replace the existing minimum tangible net worth covenant, as well as, (2) extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to July 26, 2023, (3) eliminate any borrowing base limitations on revolving loans when certain criteria exist, (4) reduce the commitment fees payable by RPC and (5) reduce the letter of credit sublimit from $50 million to $35 million. As of December 31, 2019, RPC had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and letters of credit outstanding relating to self-insurance programs and contract bids totaled $19.5 million; therefore, a total of $105.5 million of the facility was available. For additional information with respect to RPC's facility, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nThe Company's decisions about the amount of cash to be used for investing and financing purposes are influenced by its capital position, including the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations and access to borrowings under our facility. We believe our liquidity will continue to provide the opportunity to grow our asset base and revenues during periods with positive business conditions and strong customer activity levels. In addition, the Company's decisions about the amount of cash to be used for investing and financing activities may also be influenced by the financial covenants in our credit facility but we do not expect the covenants to restrict our planned activities. The Company is in compliance with these financial covenants.\nCash Requirements\nCapital expenditures were $250.6 million in 2019, and we currently expect capital expenditures to be approximately $80 million in 2020. We expect that a majority of these expenditures in 2020 will be directed towards capitalized maintenance of our existing equipment. The actual amount of capital expenditures will depend primarily on equipment maintenance requirements, expansion opportunities, and equipment delivery schedules.\nThe Company's Retirement Income Plan, a multiple employer trusteed defined benefit pension plan, provides monthly benefits upon retirement at age 65 to eligible employees. During 2019, the Company did not make any contributions to the plan and does not expect to make any contributions to the plan during 2020.\nThe Company has a stock buyback program, initially adopted in 1998 and subsequently amended in 2013 and 2018, that authorizes the repurchase of up to 41,578,125 shares. On February 12, 2018, the Board of Directors increased the number of shares authorized for repurchase by 10 million shares. There were 595,585 shares repurchased on the open market by the Company during 2019, and 8,248,184 shares remain available to be repurchased under the current authorization as of December 31, 2019. The Company may repurchase outstanding common shares periodically based on market conditions and our capital allocation strategies considering restrictions under our credit facility. The stock buyback program does not have a predetermined expiration date.\nThe Company recorded impairment and other charges of $82.3 million during 2019, of which $8.7 million is expected to have a cash impact during 2020.\nOn July 22, 2019, the Board of Directors voted to suspend RPC's dividend to common stockholders. The Company expects to resume cash dividends to common stockholders, subject to the earnings and financial condition of the Company and other relevant factors. The Company has no timetable for the resumption of dividends.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company's obligations and commitments that require future payments include our credit facility, certain non-cancelable operating leases, purchase obligations and other long-term liabilities. The following table summarizes the Company's significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\n\n(1)Operating leases include agreements for various office locations, office equipment, and certain operating equipment.\n(2)Includes agreements to purchase raw materials, goods or services that have been approved and that specify all significant terms (pricing, quantity, and timing). As part of the normal course of business the Company occasionally enters into purchase commitments to manage its various operating needs.\n(3)Includes expected cash payments for long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet where the timing of the payments is known. These amounts include incentive compensation, severance costs and estimated charges related to disposal of impaired assets. Also includes amounts related to the usage of corporate aircraft. These amounts exclude pension obligations with uncertain funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in the fair value hierarchy (Level 1, 2 or 3) based on the inputs used for valuation. Assets and liabilities that are traded on an exchange with a quoted price are classified as Level 1. Assets and liabilities that are valued using significant observable inputs in addition to quoted market prices are classified as Level 2. The Company currently has no assets or liabilities measured on a recurring basis that are valued using unobservable inputs and therefore no assets or liabilities measured on a recurring basis are classified as Level 3. For defined benefit plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ( SERP\u201d) investments measured at net asset value, the values are computed using inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data or on net asset values calculated by the fund when not publicly available.\nInflation\nThe Company purchases its equipment and materials from suppliers who provide competitive prices, and employs skilled workers from competitive labor markets. If inflation in the general economy increases, the Company's costs for equipment, materials and labor could increase as well. In addition, increases in activity in the domestic oilfield can cause upward wage pressures in the labor markets from which it hires employees, especially if employment in the general economy increases. Also, activity increases can cause increases in the costs of certain materials and key equipment components used to provide services to the Company's customers. When oilfield activity began to increase in the third quarter of 2016, the Company experienced upward pressure on the price of labor due to the shortage of skilled employees as well as occasional increases in the prices of certain raw materials used in providing our services. During 2018, however, prices for the raw material comprising the Company's single largest raw material purchase began to decline due to increased sources of supply of the material, particularly in geographic markets located close to the largest U.S. oil and gas basin. In addition, labor cost pressures during the fourth quarter of 2018 began to abate due to lower oilfield activity. These cost pressures continued to decline during 2019.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements.\nRelated Party Transactions\nMarine Products Corporation\nEffective in 2001, the Company spun off the business conducted through Chaparral Boats, Inc. ( Chaparral\u201d), RPC's former powerboat manufacturing segment. RPC accomplished the spin-off by contributing 100 percent of the issued and outstanding stock of Chaparral to Marine Products Corporation (a Delaware corporation) ( Marine Products\u201d), a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of RPC, and then distributing the common stock of Marine Products to RPC stockholders. In conjunction with the spin-off, RPC and Marine Products entered into various agreements that define the companies' relationship.\nIn accordance with a Transition Support Services agreement, which may be terminated by either party, RPC provides certain administrative services, including financial reporting and income tax administration, acquisition assistance, etc., to Marine Products. Charges from the Company (or from corporations that are subsidiaries of the Company) for such services were $865,000 in 2019, $873,000 in 2018, and $849,000 in 2017. The Company's receivable due from Marine Products for these services was $55,000 as of December 31, 2019 and $28,000 as of December 31, 2018. Many of the Company's directors are also directors of Marine Products and all of the executive officers are employees of both the Company and Marine Products.\nOther\nThe Company periodically purchases in the ordinary course of business equipment or services from suppliers, who are owned by significant officers or stockholders, or affiliated with the directors of RPC. The total amounts paid to these affiliated parties were $1,625,000 in 2019, $1,467,000 in 2018 and $1,372,000 in 2017.\nRPC receives certain administrative services and rents office space from Rollins, Inc. (a company of which Mr. R. Randall Rollins is also Chairman and which is otherwise affiliated with RPC). The service agreements between Rollins, Inc. and the Company provide for the provision of services on a cost reimbursement basis and are terminable on six months' notice. The services covered by these agreements include office space, administration of certain employee benefit programs, and other administrative services. Charges to the Company (or to corporations which are subsidiaries of the Company) for such services and rent totaled $104,000 in 2019, $101,000 in 2018 and $104,000 in 2017.\nA group that includes the Company's Chairman of the Board, R. Randall Rollins and his brother Gary W. Rollins, who is also a director of the Company, and certain companies under their control, controls in excess of fifty percent of the Company's voting power.\nRPC and Marine Products own 50 percent each of a limited liability company called 255 RC, LLC that was created for the joint purchase and ownership of a corporate aircraft. The purchase of the aircraft was completed in January 2015, and the purchase was funded primarily by a $2,554,000 contribution by each company to 255 RC, LLC. Each of RPC and Marine Products is currently a party to an operating lease agreement with 255 RC, LLC for a period of five years. RPC recorded certain net operating costs comprised of rent and an allocable share of fixed costs of $199,000 in 2019 and 2018 and $197,000 in 2017 for the corporate aircraft. The Company has a payable to 255 RC, LLC of $1.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and $0.8 million as of December 31, 2018. The Company accounts for this investment using the equity method and its proportionate share of income or loss is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2019, the investment closely approximates the underlying equity in the net assets of 255 RC, LLC.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating accounting estimates. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, trends in the industry, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies involve estimates that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity:\nAllowance for doubtful accounts - Substantially all of the Company's receivables are due from oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States, selected international locations and foreign, nationally owned oil companies. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our receivables are not overstated due to uncollectibility. Our established credit evaluation procedures seek to minimize the amount of business we conduct with higher risk customers. Our customers' ability to pay is directly related to their ability to generate cash flow on their projects and is significantly affected by the volatility in the price of oil and natural gas. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that amounts are uncollectible and recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded when collected. Significant recoveries will generally reduce the required provision in the period of recovery. Therefore, the provision for doubtful accounts can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Recoveries were insignificant in 2019, 2018 and 2017. We record specific provisions when we become aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If circumstances related to a customer changes, our estimate of the realizability of the receivable would be further adjusted, either upward or downward.\nThe estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our evaluation of the overall trends in the oil and gas industry, financial condition of our customers, our historical write-off experience, current economic conditions, and in the case of international customers, our judgments about the economic and political environment of the related country and region. In addition to reserves established for specific customers, we establish general reserves by using different percentages depending on the age of the receivables which we adjust periodically based on management judgment and the economic strength of our customers. The net provisions for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenues ranged from 0.03 percent to 0.8 percent over the last three years. Increasing or decreasing the estimated general reserve percentages by 0.50 percentage points as of December 31, 2019 would have resulted in a change of $1.1 million to the allowance for doubtful accounts and a corresponding change to selling, general and administrative expenses.\nIncome taxes - The effective income tax benefits were 23.0 percent in 2019, compared to an income tax provision of 20.7 percent in 2018 and 30.2 percent in 2017. Our effective tax rates vary due to changes in estimates of our future taxable income or losses, fluctuations in the tax jurisdictions in which our earnings and deductions are realized, and favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities related to proposed or probable assessments. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis. The effective tax rate for 2019 reflects the decrease in favorable discrete adjustments, along with a higher percentage of permanent adjustments compared to income (loss).\nThe Company establishes a valuation allowance against the carrying value of deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized through future taxable income. Such amounts are charged to earnings in the period the determination is made. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance is reversed. The Company considers future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance.\nThe Company calculates the current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified, which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for U.S. federal and state provisions. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the year the differences are expected to reverse. In 2017, the Company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the change in Federal income tax rates, as required by the TCJA. All deferred tax assets and liabilities from December 31, 2017 forward reflect the changed rate.\nThe amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. The Company believes it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire. Additionally, the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates.\nInsurance expenses -The Company self-insures, up to certain policy-specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation, vehicle and equipment liability. The cost of claims under these self-insurance programs is estimated and accrued using individual case-based valuations and statistical analysis and is based upon judgment and historical experience; however, the ultimate cost of many of these claims may not be known for several years. These claims are monitored and the cost estimates are revised as developments occur relating to such claims. The Company has retained an independent third party actuary to assist in the calculation of a range of exposure for these claims. As of December 31, 2019, the Company estimates the range of exposure to be from $19.0 million to $24.2 million. The Company has recorded liabilities at December 31, 2019 of $21.6 million which represents management's best estimate of probable loss.\nDepreciable life of assets - RPC's net property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2019 was $516.7 million representing 49.1 percent of the Company's consolidated assets. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $170.4 million. Management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated useful lives used to calculate the annual and accumulated depreciation and amortization expense.\nProperty, plant and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization, which is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the Company and is determined by management based on many factors including historical experience with similar assets. Assets are monitored to ensure changes in asset lives are identified and prospective depreciation and amortization expense is adjusted accordingly. We did not make any changes to the estimated lives of assets resulting in a material impact in 2019 or 2018.\nLong-lived assets including goodwill - RPC carries a variety of long-lived assets on our balance sheet including property, plant and equipment and goodwill. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. Goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company conducts impairment tests on goodwill annually, during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. In addition, the Company conducts impairment tests on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nFor the impairment testing on long-lived assets, other than goodwill, a long-lived asset is grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group are compared to its carrying amount. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying amount, then the Company is required to determine the asset group's fair value by using a discounted cash flow analysis. This analysis is based on estimates such as management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance, including revenue growth rates and expected profitability margins, estimates of the remaining useful life and service potential of the assets within the asset group, and a discount rate based on weighted average cost of capital. An impairment loss is measured and recorded as the amount by which the asset group's carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Assessment of goodwill impairment is conducted at the level of each reporting unit, which is the same as our reportable segments, Technical Services and Support Services, comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using an income approach and a market approach. The income approach uses discounted cash flow analysis based on management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance. This analysis includes significant assumptions regarding discount rates, revenue growth rates, expected profitability margins, forecasted capital expenditures and the timing of expected future cash flows based on market conditions. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recorded.\nThe impairment assessments discussed above incorporate inherent uncertainties, including projected commodity pricing, supply and demand for the Company's services and future market conditions, which are difficult to predict in volatile economic environments and could result in impairment charges in future periods if actual results materially differ from the estimated assumptions utilized in our forecasts. If market conditions further deteriorate, including crude oil prices significantly declining and remaining at low levels for a sustained period of time, we could be required to record additional impairments of the carrying value of our long-lived assets in the future which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nDefined benefit pension plan - In 2002, the Company ceased all future benefit accruals under the defined benefit plan, although the Company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through March 2002. The Company accounts for the defined benefit plan in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits\u201d and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs. With the assistance of the actuary, the Company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets, the discount rate, and other factors, and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary.\nThe Company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes, the investments strategy, and the views of our investment advisor. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years. Therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains (losses) ultimately affects future pension expense. The Company's assumption for the expected return on plan assets was seven percent for 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nThe discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company utilizes a yield curve approach. The approach utilizes an economic model whereby the Company's expected benefit payments over the life of the plan are forecasted and then compared to a portfolio of investment grade corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year. The economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations. The discount rate was 3.60 percent as of December 31, 2019 compared to 4.65 percent as of December 31, 2018 and 4.00 percent in 2017.\nAs set forth in Note 12 to the Company's financial statements, included among the asset categories for the Plan's investments are real estate and alternative/ opportunistic/ special fund investments comprised of real estate funds and private equity funds. These investments are measured at net asset value and are valued using significant non-observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value. These valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect, resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments. The Company seeks to mitigate these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds' judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds' financial statements for reasonableness.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the defined benefit plan was under-funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased stockholders' equity by $3.0 million after tax. Holding all other factors constant, a change in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 0.25 percentage points would result in a pre-tax increase or decrease of $1.3 million to the net loss related to pension reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nThe Company recognized pre-tax pension expense (income) of $0.3 million in 2019, $(0.2) million in 2018 and $0.4 million in 2017. Based on the under-funded status of the defined benefit plan as of December 31, 2019, the Company expects to recognize pension income of $15 thousand in 2020. Holding all other factors constant, a change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 0.50 percentage points would result in an increase or decrease in pension expense of $194 thousand in 2020. Holding all other factors constant, a change in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 0.25 percentage points would result in an increase or decrease in pension expense of $19 thousand in 2020.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued the following applicable Accounting Standards Updates (ASU):\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards:\n \u25cf Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The Company adopted ASC 842, Leases, and all the related amendments on January 1, 2019, by recognizing on its balance sheet, a right-of-use asset and lease liabilities totaling approximately $44 million, for all of its leases with terms greater than 12 months. The Company adopted the standard using the optional transition method, with an immaterial adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards that were in effect for those periods. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows. See Leases\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for expanded disclosures \n \u25cf ASU No. 2018-02-Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)-Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The amendments provide an option to reclassify stranded tax effects within AOCI to retained earnings in each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is recorded. The Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019 and elected to reclassify approximately $2.7 million of stranded tax effects related to its pension plan from AOCI to retained earnings. \n \u25cf ASU No. 2018-07 -Compensation -Stock Compensation (Topic 718) -Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. The amendments expand the scope of ASU 718 to include share-based payments issued to nonemployees for goods or services, thereby substantially aligning the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees and employees. The Company adopted these provisions in the first quarter of 2019 and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. \nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted:\nTo be adopted in 2020 and later:\n \u25cf ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments -Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. The ASU introduced a new accounting model, the Current Expected Credit Losses model (CECL), which requires earlier recognition of credit losses and additional disclosures related to credit risk. The CECL model utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for recognition in place of the current incurred loss model. The Company adopted the provisions of the standard in the first quarter of 2020 and currently expects the adoption to have an immaterial cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Company plans to continue to record an allowance on its trade receivables based on aging at the end of each reporting period using current reasonable and supportable forecasted economic conditions. \n \u25cf ASU No. 2017-04 -Intangibles -Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. To simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill, the amendments eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company adopted these provisions in the first quarter of 2020, on a prospective basis. \n \u25cf ASU No. 2018-15 -Intangibles -Goodwill and Other -Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. The amendments reduce the complexity for the accounting for costs of implementing a cloud computing service arrangement and align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs that are incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The Company adopted these provisions in the first quarter of 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. \n \u25cf ASU No. 2019-12 - Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in this ASU simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing the exceptions to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation in certain situations, requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for a change in the status of a foreign investment, and the general methodology for computing income taxes in an interim period when year-to date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. The amendments also simplify the accounting for income taxes with regard to franchise tax, evaluation of step up in the tax basis goodwill in certain business combinations, allocating current and deferred tax expense to legal entities that are not subject to tax and enacted change in tax laws or rates. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these provisions on its consolidated financial statements.

Inc. provides insights into the company's financial condition and operational performance. RPC is a provider of specialized oilfield services and targets high returns on capital while maintaining a flexible cost structure, efficient low-cost capital structure, and optimizing asset utilization. The company aims to safely deliver products and services, secure raw material supplies, increase market share, and align management and shareholder interests.\n\nMajor business strategies include focusing on equipment and markets that offer high returns, maintaining a cost structure that quickly responds to industry volatility, and leveraging direct and overhead costs to maximize revenues. Other strategies comprise maintaining an efficient capital structure with prudent debt financing, securing raw material supplies, increasing market share, and maximizing stockholder return.\n\nRPC's revenues of $1.2 billion in 2019 fell by 29% from 2018, primarily due to lower activity levels and pricing. The company focuses on equipment utilization in unconventional basins and made $250.6 million in capital expenditures in 2019 for new equipment and maintenance. Cost of revenues decreased by 22.3%, and impairment and other charges were $82.3 million due to various reasons, including equipment disposals and staff reduction. The company reported a net loss of $87.1 million for 2019 relative to a net income in 2018.\n\nThe industry conditions experienced a fall in oil prices, with a decline from $75 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2018 to $53 per barrel in the first quarter of 2020. While U.S. oil production fell by 25% in the third quarter of 2017, it subsequently rose and reached a record high by the fourth quarter of 2018. However, customer activities directed towards natural gas drilling remained weak.\n\nThe outlook suggests a decline in U.S. oilfield well completion activity due to lower oil prices, a potential slowdown in economic growth early in 2020, and reduced drilling plans by customers. The U.S. domestic drilling rig count also fell significantly from the third quarter of 2014 to the second quarter of 2016 due to a drop in oil prices. \n\nFor liquidity and capital resources, the company's cash flows decreased in 2019 compared to 2018. They have a $125 million credit facility that matures in 2023 and believe their liquidity will be adequate for at least the next twelve months. Capital expenditures are expected to be around $80 million in 2020, mainly for maintenance.\n\nLastly, the report includes discussions on critical accounting policies, recent accounting pronouncements, inflation, off-balance sheet arrangements, and related party transactions. The assessment incorporates uncertainties from market conditions, commodity pricing, and demand for services, which could potentially impact future financial results."}
