We spent approximately $50.5 million in the Wolfbone area in Reeves County, Texas in 2015 on drilling, completion and leasing activities and currently plan to spend approximately $53 million in this area in 2016. In 2015, we spent approximately $50.9 million on Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford Shale drilling and leasing activities and currently plan to spend approximately $10.7 million in this area in 2016.\nThe severe downturn in oil prices that began late in 2014 significantly reduced our cash flow from operations, causing us to suspend drilling operations in both of our core resource plays early in 2015 in order to preserve liquidity. Management quickly took decisive steps to reduce costs in an attempt to improve margins, but the combination of declining production attributable to suspended drilling activities and the impact of substantially lower oil and natural gas prices on cash flow will continue to have an adverse effect on our business if the downturn is prolonged.\nFurther significant and prolonged declines in prices could impact our ability to service our debt obligations and will further constrain our ability to use cash flows to drill to replace or increase our production and reserves.\nTo mitigate the impact of further deterioration in prices, we entered into swaps covering 1,597 MBbls of our oil production for the period from January 2016 through June 2017 at prices ranging from $40.25 to $44.30 per barrel. In addition, we granted an option on an additional 739 MBbls of oil production from July 2016 through December 2016 at $40.25 per barrel exercisable by the counterparty by June 30, 2016.\nLow commodity prices also have an adverse impact on our oil and gas reserves. In our evaluation of year-end 2015 reserves, management took into account its outlook for future oil and natural gas prices and the availability of financial resources, including the Refinancing in March 2016 (see - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Recent Developments and Outlook for 2016\u201d), to assess the future development plan for our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015. Considering the potential for an extended low product price environment, we did not schedule any proved undeveloped locations for drilling in 2016 or 2017. Based on our current long-term outlook for improved commodity prices and our reasonable expectations for access to adequate financing required to fund future drilling, we scheduled for 2018 through 2020 aggregate future capital spending for proved undeveloped locations of $135.7 million with associated reserves of 10,196 MBOE for year-end 2015. Substantially all of these proved undeveloped locations are located in our core Delaware Basin play in Reeves County, Texas. An additional $0.8 million of estimated future capital spending and 93 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves is attributable to our general partner interest in an affiliated partnership, which is proportionately consolidated in our financial statements. This assessment also resulted in the downgrade of 9,561 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to probable reserves at year-end 2015. If commodity prices do not improve to levels sufficient to support future drilling, future assessments could result in a reduction in development capital expenditures and additional downgrades of proved undeveloped reserves.\nThe prolonged effects of lower oil prices, declining production and lower proved reserves may have an adverse effect on our ability to access the capital resources we need to grow our reserve base. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a discussion of our current liquidity status and availability of capital, including the impact of the Refinancing. If we continue limited drilling activities for a significant period of time, or if our future access to capital resources is limited, we will likely further delay\nour development of our proved undeveloped reserves or ultimately suspend such development, which could result in further reductions in undeveloped reserves.\nKey Factors to Consider\nThe following summarizes the key factors considered by management in the review of our financial condition and operating performance for 2015.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The ongoing downturn in commodity prices continues to have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, having reduced our weighted average realized oil and gas prices by approximately 50% in fiscal 2015. As a result, we conducted limited drilling and completion activities in 2015 and expect to reduce capital spending further in 2016 pending an appreciable improvement in commodity prices.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Oil and gas sales, excluding amortized deferred revenues, decreased $197.7 million, or 48%, in 2015, from 2014.

Average realized oil prices were $44.76 per barrel in 2015 versus $86.81 per barrel in 2014, average realized gas prices were $2.52 per Mcf in 2015 versus $4.35 per Mcf in 2014, and average realized NGL prices were $13.07 per barrel in 2015 versus $32.17 per barrel in 2014. Oil and gas sales in 2015 also includes $4.5 million of amortized deferred revenue versus $7.7 million in 2014 attributable to the VPP granted effective March 1, 2012. In August 2015, we terminated the VPP covering 277 MBOE of oil and gas production from August 2015 through December 2019 for $13.7 million.

Unless otherwise indicated, references to 2015 and 2014 within this section refer to the respective annual periods.\nOil and gas operating results\nOil and gas sales, excluding amortized deferred revenues, decreased $197.7 million, or 48%, in 2015, from 2014. Price variances accounted for a $200.7 million decrease and production variances accounted for an increase of $3 million. Oil and gas sales in 2015 also includes $4.5 million of amortized deferred revenue versus $7.7 million in 2014 attributable to the VPP. In August 2015, we terminated the VPP covering 277 MBOE of oil and gas production from August 2015 through December 2019 for $13.7 million. Reported production and related average realized sales prices exclude volumes associated with the VPP through July 2015. Oil, gas and NGL production in 2015 (on a BOE basis) remained unchanged compared to 2014. Oil production increased 2% in 2015 from 2014 while NGL production decreased 6% and gas production decreased 2% in 2015 from 2014. After giving effect to the sale of our interests in selected leases and wells in South Louisiana in September 2015 and the sale of of certain non-core Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets in March 2014, oil, gas and NGL production in 2015 (on a BOE basis) increased 2% compared to 2014. Oil production increased 3% in 2015 from 2014, while NGL production decreased 6% and gas production decreased less than 1% in 2015 from 2014. The liquids component of our production mix accounted for approximately 83% oil and NGL in 2014 and 2015. In 2015, our realized oil price declined 48% compared to 2014, and our realized gas price decreased 42%. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile.\nProduction costs, consisting of lease operating expenses, production taxes and other miscellaneous marketing costs, decreased 17% to $87.6 million in 2015, as compared to $105.3 million in 2014, due to reductions in production taxes associated with lower oil and gas sales and reduced costs of field services. Production costs on a BOE basis, excluding production taxes, averaged $13.23 per BOE in 2015 compared to $14.57 per BOE in 2014.\nOil and gas depletion expense increased $4.9 million from 2014 to 2015 due to a $4.6 million increase related to rate variances and a $0.3 million increase due to production variances. On a BOE basis, depletion expense increased 3% to $25.54 per BOE in 2015 from $24.73 per BOE in 2014. Depletion expense per BOE of oil and gas production is an operating metric that is indicative of our weighted average cost to find or acquire a unit of equivalent production. We may realize higher oil and gas depletion rates in future periods if our exploration and development activities result in higher finding costs.\nWe recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of $41.9 million during 2015, as compared to $12 million in 2014. The 2015 impairment included a charge of $37.9 million related to primarily proved non-core properties located in the Permian Basin and Oklahoma and a charge of $4 million related to the impairment of certain drilling rigs and related equipment to reduce the carrying value to their estimated fair values. The 2014 impairment related to certain non-core properties located in the Permian Basin and North Dakota to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair values. Impairment of a proved property group is recognized when the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the property group are less than its carrying value. Assuming that commodity prices continue to decline, we may incur further asset impairments in 2016. Although it is difficult to provide an estimate because of the numerous variables and management input decisions required to evaluate the amount of any asset impairments, they could be significant.\nExploration costs\nWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting; therefore, our results of operations are adversely affected during any accounting period in which significant seismic costs, exploratory dry hole costs and unproved acreage impairments are expensed. In 2015, we charged to expense $7.8 million of exploration costs, as compared to $23 million in 2014. The expense for 2015 includes a charge of $3.1 million for the abandonment of exploratory wells in South Louisiana and Oklahoma and $1.7 million related to unproved leasehold impairments in East Texas. By comparison, the expense for 2014 includes a charge of $11.3 million related to unproved leasehold impairments in California and Oklahoma and $4.4 million for the abandonment of exploratory wells in South Louisiana and Oklahoma.\nContract drilling services\nWe primarily utilize drilling rigs owned by our subsidiary, Desta Drilling, to drill wells in our exploration and development activities. Drilling services revenues received by Desta Drilling, along with the related drilling services costs pertaining to the net interest owned by CWEI, have been eliminated in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nDrilling rig services revenue related to external customers was negligible in 2015 compared to $28 million in 2014 due to decreased demand for contract drilling services. Drilling services costs, net of eliminations, were $5.2 million in 2015 compared to $19.2 million in 2014. Contract drilling depreciation for 2015 was $12.2 million compared to $9.2 million in 2014. As discussed above, in 2015, we recorded an impairment of property and equipment of $4 million compared to none in 2014 related to the impairment of certain drilling rigs and related equipment to reduce the carrying value to their estimated fair values.\nGeneral and Administrative\nG&A expenses decreased $11.7 million from $34.5 million in 2014 to $22.8 million in 2015. Changes in compensation expense attributable to our APO reward plans accounted for a net decrease of $4.6 million. The remaining decrease in expense in 2015 was largely attributable to salary and personnel reductions.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased 7% from $50.9 million in 2014 to $54.4 million in 2015 due primarily to an increase in borrowings under the revolving credit facility, which increased from an average daily principal balance of $41 million in 2014 to $159.4 million in 2015.\nGain/loss on derivatives\nWe did not designate any derivative contracts in 2015 or 2014 as cash flow hedges; therefore, all cash settlements and changes resulting from mark-to-market valuations have been recorded as gain/loss on derivatives. In 2015, we reported a $12.5 million gain on derivatives (including a $12.5 million gain on settled contracts). In 2014, we reported a $4.8 million gain on derivatives (including a $7.1 million gain on settled contracts). Because oil and gas prices are volatile, and because we do not account for our derivatives as cash flow hedges, the effect of mark-to-market valuations on our gain/loss on derivatives can cause significant volatility in our results of operations.\nGain/loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory\nWe recorded a net loss of $3 million on sales of assets and impairment of inventory in 2015 compared to a net gain of $9.1 million in 2014. The 2015 loss related primarily to the write-down of inventory to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value offset by gains on the sale of selected leases and wells in South Louisiana in September 2015, the release of sales proceeds previously held in escrow pending resolution of title requirements associated with the sale of certain non-core Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets sold in March 2014, the sale of leases in Oklahoma in May and June 2015, and the sale of selected wells in Martin and Yoakum Counties, Texas in March 2015. The 2014 gain related primarily to the sale of the certain non-core Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets sold in March 2014 and the sale of a property in Ward County, Texas in February 2014. Gain on sales of assets are included in other operating revenues and loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory are included in other operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nIncome taxes\nOur estimated federal and state effective income tax rate in 2015 of 36% differed from the statutory federal rate of 35% due primarily to increases related to the effects of the Texas Margin Tax and certain non-deductible expenses, offset in part by tax benefits derived from excess statutory depletion deductions.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nThe following discussion compares our results for the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2013. Unless otherwise indicated, references to 2014 and 2013 within this section refer to the respective annual periods.\nOil and gas operating results\nOil and gas sales, excluding amortized deferred revenues, increased $19.4 million, or 5% in 2014, from 2013. Production variances accounted for $50.3 million of the increase, and price variances accounted for a decrease of $30.9 million. Oil and gas sales in 2014 also includes $7.7 million of amortized deferred revenue versus $8.7 million in 2013 attributable to the VPP. Reported production and related average realized sales prices exclude volumes associated with the VPP. Before giving effect to the sale of our interests in selected leases and wells in South Louisiana in September 2015, our interests in certain non-core Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets in March 2014, and the Andrews County Wolfberry assets in April 2013, oil, gas and NGL production in 2014\n(on a BOE basis) increased 10% compared to 2013. Oil production increased 14% in 2014 from 2013, NGL production increased 10% while gas production decreased 5% in 2014 from 2013. After giving effect to the asset sales discussed above, oil, gas and NGL production in 2014 (on a BOE basis) increased 21% compared to 2013. Oil production increased 28% in 2014 from 2013, NGL production increased 20%, while gas production decreased 2% in 2014 from 2013. Our production mix continued to move favorably from 80% oil and NGL in 2013 to 83% in 2014. In 2014, our realized oil price declined 9% compared to 2013, and our realized gas price increased 21%. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile.\nProduction costs, consisting of lease operating expenses, production taxes and other miscellaneous marketing costs, decreased 3% to $105.3 million in 2014, as compared to $108.4 million in 2013, due primarily to a reduction in operating costs associated with the Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford and Andrews County Wolfberry sales, offset in part by increased production taxes related to the increase in oil and gas sales.\nOil and gas depletion expense increased $5.2 million from 2013 to 2014 due to a $13.2 million increase related to production variances and an $8 million decrease due to rate variances. On a BOE basis, depletion expense decreased 5% to $24.73 per BOE in 2014 from $26.13 per BOE in 2013. Depletion expense per BOE of oil and gas production is an operating metric that is indicative of our weighted average cost to find or acquire a unit of equivalent production. We may realize higher oil and gas depletion rates in future periods if our exploration and development activities result in higher finding costs.\nWe recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of $12 million during 2014, as compared to $89.8 million in 2013. The 2014 impairment related to certain non-core properties located in the Permian Basin and North Dakota to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair values. The transaction to monetize our Andrews County Wolfberry assets in April 2013 triggered the assessment of a non-cash charge of $69.5 million in the first quarter of 2013 and the remainder related to write-downs during the year of certain non-core Permian Basin properties to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair value.\nExploration costs\nWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting; therefore, our results of operations are adversely affected during any accounting period in which significant seismic costs, exploratory dry hole costs and unproved acreage impairments are expensed. In 2014, we charged to expense $23 million of exploration costs, as compared to $9.8 million in 2013. The increase was due to abandonment and impairment expense related primarily to unproved leasehold impairments in California and the abandonment of an exploratory well in South Louisiana.\nContract drilling services\nWe primarily utilize drilling rigs owned by our subsidiary, Desta Drilling, to drill wells in our exploration and development activities. Drilling services revenues received by Desta Drilling, along with the related drilling services costs pertaining to the net interest owned by CWEI, have been eliminated in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Drilling rig services revenue related to external customers was $28 million in 2014 compared to $17.8 million in 2013. Drilling services costs related to external customers were $19.2 million in 2014 compared to $16.3 million in 2013. Contract drilling depreciation for 2014 was $9.2 million compared to $11.3 million in 2013.\nGeneral and Administrative\nG&A expenses increased $1.2 million from $33.3 million in 2013 to $34.5 million in 2014. Changes in compensation expense attributable to our APO reward plans accounted for a net increase of $2.5 million ($4.6 million in 2014 versus $2.1 million in 2013). Most of the increase in expense in 2014 was related to changes in estimated future compensation expense associated with the Eagle Ford APO reward plan offset by lower professional costs.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased 18% from $43.1 million in 2013 to $50.9 million in 2014 due primarily to the issuance in October 2013 of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019.\nGain/loss on derivatives\nWe did not designate any derivative contracts in 2014 or 2013 as cash flow hedges; therefore, all cash settlements and changes resulting from mark-to-market valuations have been recorded as gain/loss on derivatives. In 2014, we reported a $4.8\nmillion gain on derivatives (including a $7.1 million gain on settled contracts). In 2013, we reported an $8.7 million loss on derivatives (net of a $0.7 million gain on settled contracts). Because oil and gas prices are volatile, and because we do not account for our derivatives as cash flow hedges, the effect of mark-to-market valuations on our gain/loss on derivatives can cause significant volatility in our results of operations.\nGain/loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory\nWe recorded a net gain of $9.1 million on sales of assets and impairment of inventory in 2014 compared to a net gain of $3 million in 2013. The 2014 gain related primarily to the sale of certain of the Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets sold in March 2014 and the sale of a property in Ward County, Texas in February 2014. The 2013 gain related primarily to the sale of our Andrews County, Texas properties in April 2013 and the sale of non-core properties located in Walker County, Texas in August 2013. Gain on sales of assets are included in other operating revenues and loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory are included in other operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nIncome taxes\nOur estimated federal and state effective income tax rate in 2014 of 36% differed from the statutory federal rate of 35% due primarily to increases related to the effects of the Texas Margin Tax and certain non-deductible expenses, offset in part by tax benefits derived from excess statutory depletion deductions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves. We pledge substantially all of our producing oil and gas properties to secure our obligations under the revolving credit facility and the term loan credit facility (see - Recent Developments and Outlook for 2016\u201d and - Term loan credit facility\u201d). The banks under the revolving credit facility establish a borrowing base, in part, by making an estimate of the collateral value of our oil and gas properties. We believe the term loans have provided us with a source of dedicated liquidity; however, we intend to borrow funds under the revolving credit facility as needed in the future to supplement our operating cash flow as a financing source for our capital expenditure program. Our ability to fund our capital expenditure program is dependent upon the level of product prices and the success of our exploration program in replacing our existing oil and gas reserves. If product prices decrease, our operating cash flow may decrease and the banks under the revolving credit facility may require additional collateral or reduce our borrowing base, thus reducing funds available to fund our capital expenditure program. However, we may mitigate the effects of product prices on our cash flow and borrowing base through the use of commodity derivatives.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $150 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility, leaving $298.1 million available on the facility after allowing for outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.9 million, as compared to $389.1 million of availability on the facility at December 31, 2014. Following the Refinancing, our pro forma indebtedness at December 31, 2015 was approximately $933 million, consisting of $333.2 million, net of $16.8 million original issue discount, under the term loan credit agreement and $599.8 million in outstanding principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes, net of unamortized discount. The Refinancing also added approximately $180 million of cash to the balance sheet.\nRecent Developments and Outlook for 2016\nThe severe downturn in oil prices that began in 2014 significantly reduced our cash flow from operations, causing us to suspend drilling operations in both of our core resource plays early in 2015 in order to preserve liquidity. Management quickly took decisive steps to reduce costs in an attempt to improve margins, but the combination of declining production attributable to suspended drilling activities and the impact of substantially lower oil and natural gas prices on cash flow led our senior management and the Board, beginning in early July 2015, to consider a variety of strategic and financial alternatives for the Company.\nIn August 2015, the Board formed a special committee comprising all four of our independent and disinterested directors to develop, explore and evaluate strategic alternatives for the Company, including potential transactions involving a business combination, a recapitalization, a sale of assets or securities of the Company, or an other extraordinary transaction. Goldman was engaged to serve as the Company's exclusive financial advisor in this process. The special committee also engaged independent legal counsel.\nWith the assistance of senior management, Goldman identified and contacted potential counterparties on a confidential basis to determine their interest in one or more of the strategic alternatives under consideration by the Company. The Company received indications of interest across all of these alternatives. Throughout the review process, the special committee reviewed\nindications of interest and other information with Goldman, senior management, legal counsel for the Company, and legal counsel for the special committee.\nIn mid-January 2016, final bids were submitted for various potential transactions, including proposals for secured debt financing. The special committee concluded that a secured debt alternative was favorable to the Company and its stockholders. In reaching this conclusion, the special committee considered, among other factors, that the secured debt alternative (1) avoided a sale of our core assets during a time of declining commodity prices, (2) provided a dedicated source of liquidity to fund our operations and development activities over the next two to three years, (3) limited immediate dilution to existing stockholders and (4) retained the opportunity to ultimately enhance shareholder value if the commodity environment improves. The special committee instructed Goldman to negotiate final proposals with these bidders, and following negotiations, the special committee and the Board unanimously selected the proposal submitted by Ares.\nOn March 8, 2016, we entered into (1) a credit agreement with Ares providing for the issuance of second lien term loans and common stock warrants and (2) an amendment to the revolving credit facility with our banks. Upon closing of the Refinancing on March 15, 2016, we issued term loans to Ares in the principal amount of $350 million, net of original issue discount of $16.8 million, for cash proceeds of $333.2 million. Concurrently, we issued warrants to purchase 2,251,364 shares of our common stock at a price of $22.00 per share to Ares for cash proceeds equal to the original issue discount from the issuance on the term loans. The warrants represent the right to acquire approximately 18.5% of our currently outstanding shares of common stock, or approximately 15.6% of our common shares on a fully exercised basis. In connection with the issuance of the warrants, we designated and issued to the initial warrant holders 3,500 shares of special voting preferred stock, $0.10 par value per share, granting them certain rights to elect two members of our Board. Aggregate cash proceeds from the transaction of approximately $340 million, net of transaction costs, were used to fully repay the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility of $160 million, plus accrued interest and fees, and added approximately $180 million of cash to our balance sheet to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations and future development.\nThe amendment to our revolving credit facility, among other things, reduced the borrowing base and aggregate lender commitments from $450 million to $100 million and modified the financial ratio covenant by (1) deleting the requirement that we maintain a specific ratio of consolidated EBITDAX to our consolidated net interest expense and (2) replacing the requirement that we maintain a varying ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDAX with a fixed ratio of our debt under the revolving credit facility to consolidated EBITDAX of 2.0 to 1.0. The Refinancing has provided us dedicated liquidity and allowed us to decrease debt under the revolving credit facility in order to meet the financial ratio covenant under that facility.\nThroughout our review process, oil prices fell dramatically, causing uncertainty and significant volatility in the debt and equity markets. We are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the downturn in commodity prices on our business, including the extent to which lower prices could affect our financial condition and liquidity. To mitigate the impact of further deterioration in prices, in January 2016 and March 2016, we entered into swaps covering an aggregate of 1,597 MBbls of our oil production for the period from January 2016 through June 2017 at prices ranging from $40.25 to $44.30 per barrel. In addition, we granted an option on an additional 739 MBbls of oil production from July 2016 through December 2016 at $40.25 per barrel exercisable by the counterparty by June 30, 2016.\nWhile we believe we are taking appropriate actions to preserve our short-term liquidity, the effects of a prolonged cycle of low operating margins on our business are significant since they reduce our cash flow from operations and diminish the present value of our oil and gas reserves. These factors have an adverse effect on our ability to access the capital resources we need to grow our reserve base.\nCapital expenditures\nThe following table summarizes, by area, our planned expenditures for exploration and development activities during 2016, as compared to our actual expenditures in 2015.\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Actual\nExpenditures\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Planned\nExpenditures\nYear Ending\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\nPercentage\nof Total Planned Expenditures\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Drilling and completion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Permian Basin Area:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delaware Basin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>12,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford Shale\n</td> <td>37,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>7,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>94,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing and seismic\n</td> <td>29,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exploration and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur expenditures for exploration and development activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $124.5 million. We financed these expenditures in 2015 with cash flow from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales and advances under the revolving credit facility. Due to the downturn in oil prices, we currently plan to reduce spending on exploration and development activities in 2016 to approximately $65.7 million relating primarily to drill five wells in the Delaware Basin and participate in two non-operated wells. Our actual expenditures during 2016 may vary significantly from these estimates since our plans for exploration and development activities change during the year. Factors, such as changes in commodity prices, operating margins, drilling results and other factors, could increase or decrease our actual expenditures during 2016.\nBased on preliminary estimates, our internal cash flow forecasts indicate that our anticipated operating cash flows, combined with funds from our term loan credit facility and funds available to us under the revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our planned exploration and development activities at these reduced levels through 2016. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates made in our forecasts are reasonable, these forecasts are inherently uncertain and the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility may be less than expected, cash flows may be less than expected, or capital expenditures may be more than expected. We will consider options for obtaining alternative capital resources, including selling assets or accessing capital markets if necessary when we deem appropriate. Further significant and prolonged declines in prices could impact our ability to service our debt obligations and will further constrain our ability to use cash flows to drill to replace or increase our production and reserves.\nCash flow provided by operating activities\nSubstantially all of our cash flows from operating activities is derived from the production of our oil and gas reserves. We use these cash flows to fund our ongoing exploration and development activities in search of new oil and gas reserves. Variations in cash flows from operating activities may impact our level of exploration and development expenditures.\nCash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $206 million, or 80%, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014 due primarily to lower commodity prices in 2015.\nRevolving credit facility\nWe currently borrow money under a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of 16 banks led by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. On March 8, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility in connection with the Refinancing (see - Term loan credit facility\u201d). The amendment, among other things, reduced the borrowing base and the aggregate commitments of the lenders from $450 million to $100 million. The aggregate commitments may be increased to $150 million if we meet a minimum ratio of the discounted present value of our proved developed producing reserves to our debt under the revolving credit facility of 1.2 to 1.0. Increases in aggregate lender commitments require the consent of each lender.\nThe amendment also increased the applicable interest rates under our revolving credit facility by 0.75% at every borrowing base utilization level. At our election, interest under the revolving credit facility is determined by reference to (1) LIBOR plus an applicable margin between 2.5% and 3.5% per year or (2) the greatest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (C) one-month LIBOR plus 1% plus, in any of (A), (B) or (C), an applicable margin between 1.5% and 2.5% per year. We are also required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the commitments under the revolving credit facility of 0.5% per year. The applicable margin is determined based on the utilization of the borrowing base. Interest and fees are payable quarterly, except that interest on LIBOR-based tranches is due at maturity of each tranche but no less frequently than quarterly.\nThe revolving credit facility also contains various covenants and restrictive provisions that may, among other things, limit our ability to sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. One such covenant requires that we maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of at least 1 to1. The March 2016 amendment replaced a requirement that we maintain certain ratios of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDAX with a less restrictive ratio of debt outstanding solely under the revolving credit facility to consolidated EBITDAX of 2.0 to 1.0.\nThe revolving credit facility matures in April 2019 and is subject to an accelerated maturity date of October 1, 2018 unless our existing 2019 Senior Notes are refinanced or extended in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit facility prior to October 1, 2018.\nThe borrowing base, which is based on the discounted present value of future net cash flows from oil and gas production, is redetermined by the banks semi-annually in May and November. We or the banks may also request an unscheduled borrowing base redetermination at other times during the year. If, at any time, the borrowing base is less than the amount of outstanding credit exposure under the revolving credit facility, we will be required to (1) provide additional security, (2) prepay the principal amount of the loans in an amount sufficient to eliminate the deficiency, (3) prepay the deficiency in not more than five equal monthly installments plus accrued interest, or (4) take any combination of options (1) through (3).\nThe revolving credit facility is collateralized by a first lien on substantially all of our assets, including at least 90% of the adjusted engineered value (as defined in the revolving credit facility) attributed to our proved oil and gas interests evaluated in determining the borrowing base. The obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by each of CWEI's material restricted domestic subsidiaries.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $150 million of borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility, leaving $298.1 million available after allowing for outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.9 million. The effective annual interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility, excluding bank fees and amortization of debt issue costs, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 2.2%. We were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Under current commodities pricing, we expect that we will be in compliance with all financial covenants through 2016. Further deterioration in commodities pricing, however, could result in non-compliance and cause us to seek to negotiate revisions to our loan covenants, which relief may not be obtainable from our bank lenders.\nThe failure to comply with the foregoing covenants will constitute an event of default (subject, in the case of certain covenants, to applicable notice and/or cure periods) under the revolving credit facility. Other events of default under the revolving credit facility include, among other things, (1) the failure to timely pay principal, interest, fees or other amounts due and owing, (2) the inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, (3) the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, and (4) the loss of lien perfection or priority. The occurrence and continuance of an event of default could result in, among other things, acceleration of all amounts outstanding.\nWorking capital computed for loan compliance purposes differs from our working capital computed in accordance with GAAP. Since compliance with financial covenants is a material requirement under the revolving credit facility, we consider the loan compliance working capital to be useful as a measure of our liquidity because it includes the funds available to us under the revolving credit facility and is not affected by the volatility in working capital caused by changes in fair value of derivatives. Our GAAP reported working capital was $3 million at December 31, 2015 from a working capital deficit of $23.7 million at December 31, 2014. After giving effect to the adjustments, our working capital computed for loan compliance purposes was $301.2 million at December 31, 2015, as compared to $365.4 million at December 31, 2014.\nThe following table reconciles our GAAP working capital (deficit) to the working capital computed for loan compliance purposes at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital (deficit) per GAAP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(23,733\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add funds available under the revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>298,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>389,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exclude fair value of derivatives classified as current assets or current liabilities\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital per loan covenant\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a condition to borrowing funds or issuing letters of credit under our revolving credit facility, we must remain in compliance with the financial and non-financial covenants, including financial ratios, in our revolving credit facility, as amended to date. We also must make certain representations and warranties to our bank lenders at the time of each borrowing. We were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. However, if we increase leverage and our liquidity is reduced, we may fail to comply with one or more of these covenants in the future. If we fail to meet any of these loan covenants, we would ask the banks to waive compliance, amend the revolving credit facility to allow us to become compliant or grant us sufficient time to obtain additional capital resources through alternative means. Although we believe our bank lenders are well secured under the terms of our revolving credit facility, there is no assurance that the bank lenders will waive or amend our covenants or other conditions to further lending. If a suitable arrangement could not be reached with the banks, the banks could accelerate the indebtedness and seek to foreclose on the pledged assets.\nThe lending group under the revolving credit facility includes the following institutions: JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., MUFG Union Bank, N.A., Compass Bank, Frost Bank, Toronto Dominion (Texas) LLC, KeyBank National Association, Natixis, New York Branch, UBS AG, Stamford Branch, Fifth Third Bank, U.S. Bank National Association, Whitney Bank, Bank of America, N.A., Branch Banking and Trust Company, Capital One, National Association and PNC Bank, National Association.\nFrom time to time, we engage in other transactions with lenders under the revolving credit facility. Such lenders or their affiliates may serve as counterparties to our commodity and interest rate derivative agreements. As of March 2016, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was the counterparty to our commodity derivative agreements. Our obligations under derivative agreements with our lenders are secured by the security documents executed by the parties under the revolving credit facility.\nTerm loan credit facility\nOn March 8, 2016, we entered into (1) a credit agreement with Ares providing for the issuance of second lien term loans and common stock warrants and (2) an amendment to the revolving credit facility with our banks. Upon closing of the Refinancing on March 15, 2016, we issued term loans to Ares in the principal amount of $350 million, net of original issue discount of $16.8 million, for cash proceeds of $333.2 million. Concurrently, we issued warrants to purchase 2,251,364 shares of our common stock at a price of $22.00 per share to Ares for cash proceeds equal to the original issue discount from the issuance on the term loans. The warrants represent the right to acquire approximately 18.5% of our currently outstanding shares of common stock, or approximately 15.6% of our common shares on a fully exercised basis. In connection with the issuance of the warrants, we designated and issued to the initial warrant holders 3,500 shares of special voting preferred stock, $0.10 par value per share, granting them certain rights to elect two members of our Board. Aggregate cash proceeds from the transaction of approximately $340 million, net of transaction costs, were used to fully repay the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility of $160 million, plus accrued interest and fees, and added approximately $180 million of cash to our balance sheet to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations and future development (see Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nInterest on the term loans is payable quarterly in cash at 12.5% per year; however, during the period from March 15, 2016 through March 31, 2018, we may elect to pay interest for any quarter in kind at 15% per year. We have agreed in advance to pay interest for the period commencing from March 15, 2016 and ending March 31, 2016 in cash, and have elected to pay interest for the quarterly period ending June 30, 2016 in kind.\nThe term loan credit facility matures on March 15, 2021, but is subject to an earlier maturity on December 31, 2018, if we do not extend or refinance our existing 2019 Senior Notes on or prior to that date.\nThe term loan credit facility is collateralized by a second lien on substantially all of our assets, including at least 90% of the adjusted engineered value (as defined in the term loan credit facility) attributed to our proved oil and gas interests. The obligations under the term loan credit facility are guaranteed by each of CWEI's material restricted domestic subsidiaries. Optional and mandatory prepayments made prior to September 15, 2020 are subject to make-whole or prepayment premiums.\nThe term loan credit facility also contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which may, among other things, limit our ability to sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. One such covenant requires that we maintain an asset-to-secured debt coverage ratio as of each December 31 and June 30 of each year, beginning with December 31, 2018, of at least 1.2 to 1.0. Under current commodities pricing, we expect that we will be in compliance with all financial covenants through 2016. Further deterioration in commodities pricing, however, could result in non-compliance and cause us to seek to negotiate revisions to our loan covenants, which relief may not be obtainable from our bank lenders.\nThe failure to comply with these covenants will constitute an event of default (subject, in the case of certain covenants, to applicable notice and/or cure periods) under the term loan credit facility. Other events of default under the term loan credit facility include, among other things, (1) the failure to timely pay principal, interest, fees or other amounts due and owing, (2) the inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, (3) the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, and (4) the loss of lien perfection or priority. The occurrence and continuance of an event of default could result in, among other things, acceleration of all amounts outstanding.\nSenior Notes\nIn March 2011, we issued $300 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes. The 2019 Senior Notes, which are unsecured, were issued at par and bear interest at 7.75% per year, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. In April 2011, we issued an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes with an original issue discount of 1% or $0.5 million. In October 2013, we issued an additional $250 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes at par to yield 7.75% to maturity. All of the 2019 Senior Notes are treated as a single class of debt securities under the same indenture. We may redeem some or all of the 2019 Senior Notes at redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) equal to 101.938% beginning on April 1, 2016 and 100% beginning on April 1, 2017 or for any period thereafter, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe Indenture contains covenants that restrict our ability to: (1) borrow money; (2) issue redeemable or preferred stock; (3) pay distributions or dividends; (4) make investments; (5) create liens without securing the 2019 Senior Notes; (6) enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries; (7) sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies; (8) enter into transactions with affiliates; (9) guarantee indebtedness; and (10) enter into new lines of business. One such covenant provides that, with certain exceptions, we may incur indebtedness if the ratio of consolidated EBITDAX to consolidated interest expense (as these terms are defined in the Indenture) exceeds 2.25 times. While we met this ratio as of December 31, 2015, if we do not meet this ratio in the future, in order to borrow under our revolving credit facility or make other borrowings, we expect to rely primarily on a covenant provision permitting the incurrence of indebtedness under a Credit Facility (as defined in the Indenture) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the greater of (a) $500 million and (b) 30% of Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as defined in the Indenture). These covenants are subject to a number of additional important exceptions and qualifications as described in the Indenture. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nAsset Sales\nFrom time to time, we sell certain of our proved and unproved properties when we believe it is more advantageous to dispose of the selected properties than to continue to hold them. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we received cash proceeds aggregating $71.5 million from various asset sales including the sale under a three-year term assignment in December 2015 of certain acreage in Burleson County, Texas for $21.8 million, the sale in June 2015 pursuant to a term assignment of certain acreage in Burleson County, Texas for $22.1 million and a sale in September 2015 of our interests in selected leases and wells in South Louisiana for $11.8 million. We are actively considering other selected sales as a source of additional funds to supplement cash flow from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan credit facility to meet our capital needs.\nAlternative capital resources\nWe believe we currently have adequate liquidity to enable us to fund our expected capital expenditures for 2016 through a combination of (1) cash on hand made available by the Refinancing, (2) cash flow from operations, and (3) borrowings under the revolving credit facility.\nSubject to any restrictions in the revolving credit facility and the term loan credit facility, we may also use other capital resources, including (1) entering into joint venture participation agreements with other industry or financial partners in our core development areas, (2) monetizing all or a portion of our core or non-core assets and (3) issuing additional debt or equity securities in private or public offerings, in order to finance a portion of our capital spending in fiscal 2016 and subsequent periods. While we believe we would be able to obtain funds through one or more of these alternative capital resources, if needed, there can be no assurance that these capital resources would be available on terms acceptable to us.\nContractual obligations and contingent commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 by payment due date.\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\nto\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\nto\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7.75% Senior Notes, due 2019, net of discount of $241(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>599,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>599,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility, due April 2019(a)\n</td> <td>150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations(b)\n</td> <td>6,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations(c)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>756,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>750,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>______\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>In addition to the principal payments presented, we expect to make annual interest payments of $47.1 million on the 2019 Senior Notes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Amount includes lease payments for two drilling rigs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(c)\n</td> <td>Following the Refinancing, our pro forma indebtedness at December 31, 2015 was approximately $933 million, consisting of $333.2 million, net of $16.8 million original issue discount, under the term loan credit agreement and $599.8 million in outstanding principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes, net of unamortized discount.

Our weighted average oil and gas sales per BOE have declined from $76.11 per BOE in 2013, to $72.59 per BOE in 2014 and $37.67 per BOE in 2015. Our oil and gas depletion per BOE fluctuated from $26.13 per BOE in 2013, to $24.73 per BOE in 2014 and $25.54 per BOE in 2015. Our production costs per BOE have decreased from $20.63 per BOE in 2013, to $18.27 per BOE in 2014 and $15.17 per BOE in 2015. The decrease in operating costs per BOE in 2015 from 2013 was due primarily to lower costs of field services, decreased production taxes resulting from lower commodity prices in 2015 and a reduction in production costs associated with the sale of non-core assets.\nOil and Gas Production\nAs with all companies engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, we face the challenge of natural production decline because oil and gas reserves are a depletable resource. With each unit of oil and gas we produce, we are depleting our proved reserve base, so we must be able to conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties with proved reserves in order to grow our reserve base. Our production in 2015 remained unchanged at 5.8 MMBOE compared to 2014, and we replaced 61% of our 2015 oil and gas production through extensions and discoveries. While these 2015 reserve additions will contribute favorably to our production in 2016, we do not expect this production to be sufficient to fully offset the natural production declines from our existing base of oil and gas reserves.\nWe currently plan to decrease capital spending during 2016 to $65.7 million on exploration and development activities compared to $124.5 million in 2015. Failure to maintain or grow our oil and gas reserves may result in lower production and may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nImpact of Downturn in Oil Prices\nOur business is subject to various trends and uncertainties, the most significant of which are related to commodity prices. The severe downturn in oil prices that began late in 2014 significantly reduced our cash flow from operations, causing us to suspend drilling operations in both of our core resource plays early in 2015 in order to preserve liquidity. Management quickly took decisive steps to reduce costs in an attempt to improve margins, but the combination of declining production attributable to suspended drilling activities and the impact of substantially lower oil and natural gas prices on cash flow will continue to have an adverse effect on our business if the downturn is prolonged.\nFurther significant and prolonged declines in prices could impact our ability to service our debt obligations and will further constrain our ability to use cash flows to drill to replace or increase our production and reserves.\nTo mitigate the impact of further deterioration in prices, we entered into swaps covering 1,597 MBbls of our oil production for the period from January 2016 through June 2017 at prices ranging from $40.25 to $44.30 per barrel. In addition, we granted an option on an additional 739 MBbls of oil production from July 2016 through December 2016 at $40.25 per barrel exercisable by the counterparty by June 30, 2016.\nLow commodity prices also have an adverse impact on our oil and gas reserves. In our evaluation of year-end 2015 reserves, management took into account its outlook for future oil and natural gas prices and the availability of financial resources, including the Refinancing in March 2016, to assess the future development plan for our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015. Considering the potential for an extended low product price environment, we did not schedule any proved undeveloped locations for drilling in 2016 or 2017. Based on our current long-term outlook for improved commodity prices and our reasonable expectations for access to adequate financing required to fund future drilling, we scheduled for 2018 through 2020 aggregate future capital spending for proved undeveloped locations of $135.7 million with associated reserves of 10,196 MBOE for year-end 2015. Substantially all of these proved undeveloped locations are located in our core Delaware Basin play in Reeves County, Texas. An additional $0.8 million of estimated future capital spending and 93 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves is attributable to our general partner interest in an affiliated partnership, which is proportionately consolidated in our financial statements. This assessment also resulted in the downgrade of 9,561 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to probable reserves at year-end 2015. If commodity prices do not improve to levels sufficient to support future drilling, future assessments could result in a reduction in development capital expenditures and additional downgrades of proved undeveloped reserves.\nThe prolonged effects of lower oil prices, declining production and lower proved reserves may have an adverse effect on our ability to access the capital resources we need to grow our reserve base. If we continue limited drilling activities for a significant period of time, or if our future access to capital resources is limited, we will also likely further delay our development of our proved undeveloped reserves or ultimately suspend such development, which could result in further reductions in undeveloped reserves.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSummary\nIn this section, we will identify the critical accounting policies we follow in preparing our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. Many of these policies require us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments in the course of making estimates of matters that are inherently imprecise. We explain the nature of these estimates, assumptions and judgments, and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported in our consolidated financial statements under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nThe following table lists our critical accounting policies, the estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the application of these accounting policies and the financial statement accounts affected by these estimates and assumptions.\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounting Policies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimates or Assumptions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Accounts Affected\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Successful efforts accounting for oil and gas properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Reserve estimates\n\u00b7 Valuation of unproved properties\n\u00b7 Judgment regarding status of in progress exploratory wells\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Oil and gas properties\n\u00b7 Accumulated DD&A\n\u00b7 Provision for DD&A\n\u00b7 Impairment of unproved properties\n\u00b7 Abandonment costs (dry hole costs)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of proved properties and long-lived assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Reserve estimates and related present value of future net revenues (proved properties)\n\u00b7 Estimates of future undiscounted cash flows (long-lived assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Oil and gas properties\n\u00b7 Contract drilling equipment\n\u00b7 Accumulated DD&A\n\u00b7 Impairment of proved properties and long-lived assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Estimates of the present value of future abandonment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Asset retirement obligations (non-current liability)\n\u00b7 Oil and gas properties\n\u00b7 Accretion of discount expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory stated at the lower of average cost or estimated market value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Estimates of market value of tubular goods and other well equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Impairment of inventory\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives mark-to-market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Estimates of the fair value of derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Fair value of derivatives\n\u00b7 Other income (expense): Gain (loss) on derivatives\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant Estimates and Assumptions\nOil and gas reserves\nReserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of a reserve estimate depends on the quality of available geological and engineering data, the precision of and the interpretation of that data and judgment based on experience and training. Annually, we engage independent petroleum engineering firms to evaluate our oil and gas reserves. As a part of this process, our internal reservoir engineer and the independent petroleum engineers exchange information and attempt to reconcile any material differences in estimates and assumptions.\nThe techniques used in estimating reserves usually depend on the nature and extent of available data, and the accuracy of the estimates may vary accordingly. As a general rule, the degree of accuracy of reserve estimates varies with the reserve classification and the related accumulation of available data, as shown in the following table.\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Type of Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Nature of Available Data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Degree of Precision\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proved undeveloped\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Data from offsetting wells, geologic data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Least precise\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proved developed non-producing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Logs, core samples, well tests, pressure data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More precise\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proved developed producing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Production history, pressure data over time\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Most precise\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAssumptions as to future commodity prices and operating and capital costs also play a significant role in estimating oil and gas reserves and the estimated present value of the cash flows to be received from the future production of those reserves. Volumes of recoverable reserves are affected by the assumed prices and costs due to what is known as the economic limit (that point in the future when the projected costs and expenses of producing recoverable reserves exceed the projected revenues from the reserves). But more significantly, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is extremely sensitive to prices and costs, and may vary materially based on different assumptions. Current SEC financial accounting and reporting standards require that pricing parameters be the arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the 12-month period preceding the effective date of the reserve report. Varying pricing can result in significant changes in reserves and standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from period to period, as illustrated in the following table.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Proved Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Standardized\nMeasure of Discounted Future\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Oil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Natural Gas Liquids\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Oil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Natural Gas Liquids\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(MMBbls)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(MMBbls)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Bcf)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($/Bbl)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($/Bbl)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($/Mcf)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Cash Flows\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>33.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>390.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>53.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>932.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013\n</td> <td>48.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>926.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nValuation of unproved properties\nEstimating fair market value of unproved properties (also known as prospects) is very subjective since there is no quoted market for undeveloped exploratory prospects. The negotiated price of any prospect between a willing seller and willing buyer depends on the specific facts regarding the prospect, including:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the location of the prospect in relation to known fields and reservoirs, available markets and transportation systems for oil and gas production in the vicinity and other critical services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the nature and extent of geological and geophysical data on the prospect;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the terms of the leases holding the acreage in the prospect, such as ownership interests, expiration terms, royalty interests, delay rental obligations, depth limitations, drilling and marketing restrictions, continuous development obligations, and similar terms;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the prospect's risk-adjusted potential for return on investment, giving effect to such factors as potential reserves to be discovered, drilling and completion costs, prevailing commodity prices and other economic factors; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the results of drilling activity in close proximity to the prospect that could either enhance or condemn the prospect's chances of success.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe estimate the present value of the amount we will incur to plug, abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives, in accordance with applicable state laws. We compute our liability for asset retirement obligations\nby calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows related to each property. This requires us to use significant assumptions, including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs, annual inflation of these costs, the productive lives of wells and our risk-adjusted interest rate. Changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligations.\nEffects of Estimates and Assumptions on Financial Statements\nGAAP does not require, or even permit, the restatement of previously issued financial statements due to changes in estimates unless such estimates were unreasonable or did not comply with applicable SEC accounting rules. We are required to use our best judgment in making estimates and assumptions, taking into consideration the best and most current data available to us at the time of the estimate. At each accounting period, we make a new estimate using new data, and continue the cycle. You should be aware that estimates prepared at various times may be substantially different due to new or additional data. While an estimate made at one point in time may differ from an estimate made at a later date, both may be proper due to the differences in available data or assumptions. In this section, we will discuss the effects of different estimates on our consolidated financial statements.\nProvision for DD&A\nWe compute our provision for DD&A on a unit-of-production method. Each quarter, we use the following formulas to compute the provision for DD&A for each of our producing properties (or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities):\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>DD&A Rate = Unamortized Cost / Beginning of Period Reserves\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Provision for DD&A = DD&A Rate x Current Period Production\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReserve estimates have a significant impact on the DD&A rate. If reserve estimates for a property or group of properties are revised downward in future periods, the DD&A rate for that property or group of properties will increase as a result of the revision. Alternatively, if reserve estimates are revised upward, the DD&A rate will decrease.\nImpairment of Unproved Properties\nEach quarter, we review our unproved oil and gas properties to determine if there has been, in our judgment, an impairment in value of each prospect that we consider individually significant. To the extent that the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated value, we make a provision for impairment of unproved properties and record the provision as abandonments and impairments within exploration costs on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). If the value is revised upward in a future period, we do not reverse the prior provision, and we continue to carry the prospect at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value. If the value is revised downward in a future period, an additional provision for impairment is made in that period.\nImpairment of Proved Properties and Long-Lived Assets\nEach quarter, we assess our producing properties for impairment. If we determine there has been an impairment in any of our producing properties (or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities), we will estimate the value of each affected property. In accordance with GAAP, the value for this purpose is a fair value using Level 3 inputs instead of a standardized reserve value as prescribed by the SEC. We attempt to value each property using reserve classifications and pricing parameters similar to what a willing seller and willing buyer might use. These parameters may include escalations of prices instead of constant pricing, and they may also include the risk-adjusted value of reserves. To the extent that the carrying cost for the affected property exceeds its estimated fair value, we make a provision for impairment of proved properties. If the fair value is revised upward in a future period, we do not reverse the prior provision, and we continue to carry the property at a net cost that is lower than its estimated fair value. If the fair value is revised downward in a future period, an additional provision for impairment is made in that period. Accordingly, the carrying costs of producing properties on our balance sheet will vary from (and often will be less than) the present value of proved reserves for these properties.\nJudgment Regarding Status of In-Progress Wells\nOn a quarterly basis, we review the status of each in-progress well to determine the proper accounting treatment under the successful efforts method of accounting. Cumulative costs on in-progress wells remain capitalized until their productive status becomes known. If an in-progress exploratory well is found to be unsuccessful (often referred to as a dry hole) prior to the issuance of our consolidated financial statements, we write-off all costs incurred through the balance sheet date to abandonments and\nimpairments expense, a component of exploration costs. Costs incurred on that dry hole after the balance sheet date are charged to exploration costs in the period incurred.\nOccasionally, we are unable to make a final determination about the productive status of a well prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements. In these cases, we leave the well classified as in-progress until we have had sufficient time to conduct additional completion or testing operations and to evaluate the pertinent geological and geophysical and engineering data obtained. At the time when we are able to make a final determination of a well's productive status, the well is removed from the in-progress status and the proper accounting treatment is recorded.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOur asset retirement obligations are recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset's inception, with an offsetting increase to oil and gas properties. Periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). During 2015, we had an upward revision of our estimated asset retirement obligations of $3.1 million based on a review of current plugging and abandonment costs. Revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to producing properties, resulting in prospective changes to DD&A expense and accretion expense. Because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells, the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).\u201d The main difference between the current requirement under GAAP and ASU 2016-02 is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current operating leases) while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current capital leases). Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-02 must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. Transaction will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. We are evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes.\u201d This ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The standard will be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption will be permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. This standard may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities or retrospectively to all periods presented. Adoption of the new guidance will affect the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.\u201d This ASU requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied prospectively, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d that requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. An entity is required to apply ASU 2015-03 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. An entity should apply ASU 2015-03 on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. Upon transition, an entity is required to comply with the applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting principle. These disclosures include the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle, the transition method, a description of the prior-period information that has\nbeen retrospectively adjusted, and the effect of the change on the financial statement line items (that is, debt issuance cost asset and the debt liability). We currently present debt issuance costs on the balance sheet as an asset. As of December 31, 2015, we had $9.6 million of debt issuance costs, which under this standard would be reclassified from an asset to a direct deduction to the related debt liability.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\u201d that outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date\u201d, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. That new standard is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. An entity can apply ASU 2014-09 using either a full retrospective method, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or a modified retrospective method, meaning the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard is recognized in the most current period presented in the financial statements. We are evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion is intended to provide information relevant to an understanding of our financial condition, changes in our financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto.\nOverview\nWe have been committed to drilling primarily developmental oil wells in two primary oil-prone regions, the Permian Basin and the Giddings Area, where we have a significant inventory of developmental drilling opportunities. We spent approximately $50.5 million in the Wolfbone area in Reeves County, Texas in 2015 on drilling, completion and leasing activities and currently plan to spend approximately $53 million in this area in 2016. In 2015, we spent approximately $50.9 million on Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford Shale drilling and leasing activities and currently plan to spend approximately $10.7 million in this area in 2016.\nThe severe downturn in oil prices that began late in 2014 significantly reduced our cash flow from operations, causing us to suspend drilling operations in both of our core resource plays early in 2015 in order to preserve liquidity. Management quickly took decisive steps to reduce costs in an attempt to improve margins, but the combination of declining production attributable to suspended drilling activities and the impact of substantially lower oil and natural gas prices on cash flow will continue to have an adverse effect on our business if the downturn is prolonged.\nFurther significant and prolonged declines in prices could impact our ability to service our debt obligations and will further constrain our ability to use cash flows to drill to replace or increase our production and reserves.\nTo mitigate the impact of further deterioration in prices, we entered into swaps covering 1,597 MBbls of our oil production for the period from January 2016 through June 2017 at prices ranging from $40.25 to $44.30 per barrel. In addition, we granted an option on an additional 739 MBbls of oil production from July 2016 through December 2016 at $40.25 per barrel exercisable by the counterparty by June 30, 2016.\nLow commodity prices also have an adverse impact on our oil and gas reserves. In our evaluation of year-end 2015 reserves, management took into account its outlook for future oil and natural gas prices and the availability of financial resources, including the Refinancing in March 2016 (see - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Recent Developments and Outlook for 2016\u201d), to assess the future development plan for our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015. Considering the potential for an extended low product price environment, we did not schedule any proved undeveloped locations for drilling in 2016 or 2017. Based on our current long-term outlook for improved commodity prices and our reasonable expectations for access to adequate financing required to fund future drilling, we scheduled for 2018 through 2020 aggregate future capital spending for proved undeveloped locations of $135.7 million with associated reserves of 10,196 MBOE for year-end 2015. Substantially all of these proved undeveloped locations are located in our core Delaware Basin play in Reeves County, Texas. An additional $0.8 million of estimated future capital spending and 93 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves is attributable to our general partner interest in an affiliated partnership, which is proportionately consolidated in our financial statements. This assessment also resulted in the downgrade of 9,561 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to probable reserves at year-end 2015. If commodity prices do not improve to levels sufficient to support future drilling, future assessments could result in a reduction in development capital expenditures and additional downgrades of proved undeveloped reserves.\nThe prolonged effects of lower oil prices, declining production and lower proved reserves may have an adverse effect on our ability to access the capital resources we need to grow our reserve base. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a discussion of our current liquidity status and availability of capital, including the impact of the Refinancing. If we continue limited drilling activities for a significant period of time, or if our future access to capital resources is limited, we will likely further delay\nour development of our proved undeveloped reserves or ultimately suspend such development, which could result in further reductions in undeveloped reserves.\nKey Factors to Consider\nThe following summarizes the key factors considered by management in the review of our financial condition and operating performance for 2015.\n \u2022 The ongoing downturn in commodity prices continues to have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, having reduced our weighted average realized oil and gas prices by approximately 50% in fiscal 2015. As a result, we conducted limited drilling and completion activities in 2015 and expect to reduce capital spending further in 2016 pending an appreciable improvement in commodity prices. \n \u2022 Oil and gas sales, excluding amortized deferred revenues, decreased $197.7 million, or 48%, in 2015, from 2014. Price variances accounted for a decrease of $200.7 million and production variances accounted for an increase of $3 million. Average realized oil prices were $44.76 per barrel in 2015 versus $86.81 per barrel in 2014, average realized gas prices were $2.52 per Mcf in 2015 versus $4.35 per Mcf in 2014, and average realized NGL prices were $13.07 per barrel in 2015 versus $32.17 per barrel in 2014. Oil and gas sales in 2015 also includes $4.5 million of amortized deferred revenue versus $7.7 million in 2014 attributable to the VPP granted effective March 1, 2012. In August 2015, we terminated the VPP covering 277 MBOE of oil and gas production from August 2015 through December 2019 for $13.7 million. Reported production and related average realized sales prices exclude volumes associated with the VPP. \n \u2022 Oil, gas and NGL production per BOE remained unchanged in 2015 compared to 2014, with oil production increasing 2% to 11,663 barrels per day, gas production decreasing 2% to 15,885 Mcf per day and NGL production decreasing 6% to 1,507 barrels per day. Oil and NGL production accounted for approximately 83% of our total BOE production in 2015 and 2014. \n \u2022 Production costs decreased 17% from $105.3 million in 2014 to $87.6 million in 2015 due to reductions in production taxes associated with lower oil and gas sales, and reduced costs of field services. Production costs on a BOE basis, excluding production taxes, averaged $13.23 per BOE in 2015 versus $14.57 per BOE in 2014. \n \u2022 We recorded a $12.5 million gain on derivatives in 2015 (including a $12.5 million gain on settled contracts). For 2014, we recorded a $4.8 million gain on derivatives (including a $7.1 million gain on settled contracts). Since we do not presently designate our derivatives as cash flow hedges under applicable accounting standards, we recognize the full effect of changing prices on mark-to-market valuations as a current charge or credit to our results of operations. \n \u2022 Lower commodity prices also negatively impacted our results of operations due to asset impairments. During 2015, we recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of $41.9 million, of which $37.9 million related to the impairment of certain non-core properties in the Permian Basin and Oklahoma and $4 million related to the impairment of certain drilling rigs and related equipment to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair values. By comparison, we recorded an impairment of property and equipment in 2014 of $12 million related to certain non-core properties located in the Permian Basin and North Dakota to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair values. Also in 2015, we recorded charges to other operating expenses of $10.4 million for mark-to-market valuations of our tubular inventory and charges to other expense of $2.6 million to reducing the carrying value of our investment in Dalea Investment Group, LLC to its estimated fair value. \n \u2022 We recorded exploration expense related to abandonment and impairment costs during 2015 of $6.5 million compared to $20.6 million in 2014. The expense for 2015 includes a charge of $3.1 million for the abandonment of exploratory wells in South Louisiana and Oklahoma and $1.7 million related to unproved leasehold impairments in East Texas. By comparison, the expense for 2014 includes a charge of $11.3 million related to unproved leasehold impairments in California and Oklahoma and $4.4 million for the abandonment of exploratory wells in South Louisiana and Oklahoma. \n \u2022 General and administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses for 2015 were $22.8 million compared to $34.5 million in 2014. Changes in compensation expense attributable to our APO Reward Plans accounted for a net decrease of $4.6 million. The remaining decrease in expense was largely attributable to salary and personnel reductions. \n \u2022 Our estimated proved oil and gas reserves at December 31, 2015 decreased 38% to 46,569 MBOE from 75,430 MBOE at December 31, 2014. We replaced 61% of our oil and gas production in 2015 through extensions and discoveries of 3,542 MBOE, had net downward revisions of 26,158 MBOE and sales of minerals-in-place of 472 MBOE. \nOil and Gas Reserves\nTotal Proved Reserves\nThe following table summarizes changes in our estimated proved reserves during 2015.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Proved\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Reserves\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(MBOE)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>75,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Extensions and discoveries\n</td> <td>3,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revisions\n</td> <td>(26,158\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales of minerals-in-place\n</td> <td>(472\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Production\n</td> <td>(5,773\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>46,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExtensions and discoveries. Extensions and discoveries in 2015 added 3,542 MBOE of proved reserves, replacing 61% of our 2015 production. These additions resulted primarily from our Delaware Basin program. Of the total reserve additions, proved developed reserves accounted for 2,648 MBOE, while the remaining 894 MBOE were proved undeveloped reserves.\nRevisions. The 26,158 MBOE net downward revisions in proved reserves resulted from a combination of (1) reclassifications of 9,561 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to probable reserves due solely to the SEC five-year development rule, (2) net upward revisions of 11,963 MBOE related primarily to performance in our Delaware Basin program and (3) downward revisions of 28,560 MBOE related to the effects of lower commodity prices on the estimated quantities of proved reserves.\nSales of minerals-in-place. We sold our interests in certain selected leases and wells in South Louisiana in September 2015 resulting in a decrease of 472 MBOE.\nProved Undeveloped Reserves\nSummary of changes in proved undeveloped reserves\nThe following table summarizes changes in our estimated proved undeveloped reserves during 2015.\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Proved\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Undeveloped\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Reserves\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(MBOE)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>33,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Extensions and discoveries\n</td> <td>894\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revisions\n</td> <td>(21,610\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reclassified to proved developed\n</td> <td>(2,186\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>10,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe added 894 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves from extensions and discoveries related to Delaware Basin drilling locations. Net downward revisions of 21,610 MBOE resulted primarily from the combination of (1) reclassification of 9,561 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to probable reserves due solely to the SEC five-year development rule, (2) net upward revisions of 7,968 MBOE related to performance in our Delaware Basin program and (3) downward revisions of 20,017 MBOE related to the effects of lower commodity prices on the estimated quantities of proved reserves. We also converted 2,186 MBOE, or 6.6%, of our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2014 to proved developed reserves at a cost of approximately $45 million.\nSupplemental Information\nThe

Unless otherwise indicated, references to 2015 and 2014 within this section refer to the respective annual periods.\nOil and gas operating results\nOil and gas sales, excluding amortized deferred revenues, decreased $197.7 million, or 48%, in 2015, from 2014. Price variances accounted for a $200.7 million decrease and production variances accounted for an increase of $3 million. Oil and gas sales in 2015 also includes $4.5 million of amortized deferred revenue versus $7.7 million in 2014 attributable to the VPP. In August 2015, we terminated the VPP covering 277 MBOE of oil and gas production from August 2015 through December 2019 for $13.7 million. Reported production and related average realized sales prices exclude volumes associated with the VPP through July 2015. Oil, gas and NGL production in 2015 (on a BOE basis) remained unchanged compared to 2014. Oil production increased 2% in 2015 from 2014 while NGL production decreased 6% and gas production decreased 2% in 2015 from 2014. After giving effect to the sale of our interests in selected leases and wells in South Louisiana in September 2015 and the sale of of certain non-core Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets in March 2014, oil, gas and NGL production in 2015 (on a BOE basis) increased 2% compared to 2014. Oil production increased 3% in 2015 from 2014, while NGL production decreased 6% and gas production decreased less than 1% in 2015 from 2014. The liquids component of our production mix accounted for approximately 83% oil and NGL in 2014 and 2015. In 2015, our realized oil price declined 48% compared to 2014, and our realized gas price decreased 42%. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile.\nProduction costs, consisting of lease operating expenses, production taxes and other miscellaneous marketing costs, decreased 17% to $87.6 million in 2015, as compared to $105.3 million in 2014, due to reductions in production taxes associated with lower oil and gas sales and reduced costs of field services. Production costs on a BOE basis, excluding production taxes, averaged $13.23 per BOE in 2015 compared to $14.57 per BOE in 2014.\nOil and gas depletion expense increased $4.9 million from 2014 to 2015 due to a $4.6 million increase related to rate variances and a $0.3 million increase due to production variances. On a BOE basis, depletion expense increased 3% to $25.54 per BOE in 2015 from $24.73 per BOE in 2014. Depletion expense per BOE of oil and gas production is an operating metric that is indicative of our weighted average cost to find or acquire a unit of equivalent production. We may realize higher oil and gas depletion rates in future periods if our exploration and development activities result in higher finding costs.\nWe recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of $41.9 million during 2015, as compared to $12 million in 2014. The 2015 impairment included a charge of $37.9 million related to primarily proved non-core properties located in the Permian Basin and Oklahoma and a charge of $4 million related to the impairment of certain drilling rigs and related equipment to reduce the carrying value to their estimated fair values. The 2014 impairment related to certain non-core properties located in the Permian Basin and North Dakota to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair values. Impairment of a proved property group is recognized when the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the property group are less than its carrying value. Assuming that commodity prices continue to decline, we may incur further asset impairments in 2016. Although it is difficult to provide an estimate because of the numerous variables and management input decisions required to evaluate the amount of any asset impairments, they could be significant.\nExploration costs\nWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting; therefore, our results of operations are adversely affected during any accounting period in which significant seismic costs, exploratory dry hole costs and unproved acreage impairments are expensed. In 2015, we charged to expense $7.8 million of exploration costs, as compared to $23 million in 2014. The expense for 2015 includes a charge of $3.1 million for the abandonment of exploratory wells in South Louisiana and Oklahoma and $1.7 million related to unproved leasehold impairments in East Texas. By comparison, the expense for 2014 includes a charge of $11.3 million related to unproved leasehold impairments in California and Oklahoma and $4.4 million for the abandonment of exploratory wells in South Louisiana and Oklahoma.\nContract drilling services\nWe primarily utilize drilling rigs owned by our subsidiary, Desta Drilling, to drill wells in our exploration and development activities. Drilling services revenues received by Desta Drilling, along with the related drilling services costs pertaining to the net interest owned by CWEI, have been eliminated in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nDrilling rig services revenue related to external customers was negligible in 2015 compared to $28 million in 2014 due to decreased demand for contract drilling services. Drilling services costs, net of eliminations, were $5.2 million in 2015 compared to $19.2 million in 2014. Contract drilling depreciation for 2015 was $12.2 million compared to $9.2 million in 2014. As discussed above, in 2015, we recorded an impairment of property and equipment of $4 million compared to none in 2014 related to the impairment of certain drilling rigs and related equipment to reduce the carrying value to their estimated fair values.\nGeneral and Administrative\nG&A expenses decreased $11.7 million from $34.5 million in 2014 to $22.8 million in 2015. Changes in compensation expense attributable to our APO reward plans accounted for a net decrease of $4.6 million. The remaining decrease in expense in 2015 was largely attributable to salary and personnel reductions.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased 7% from $50.9 million in 2014 to $54.4 million in 2015 due primarily to an increase in borrowings under the revolving credit facility, which increased from an average daily principal balance of $41 million in 2014 to $159.4 million in 2015.\nGain/loss on derivatives\nWe did not designate any derivative contracts in 2015 or 2014 as cash flow hedges; therefore, all cash settlements and changes resulting from mark-to-market valuations have been recorded as gain/loss on derivatives. In 2015, we reported a $12.5 million gain on derivatives (including a $12.5 million gain on settled contracts). In 2014, we reported a $4.8 million gain on derivatives (including a $7.1 million gain on settled contracts). Because oil and gas prices are volatile, and because we do not account for our derivatives as cash flow hedges, the effect of mark-to-market valuations on our gain/loss on derivatives can cause significant volatility in our results of operations.\nGain/loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory\nWe recorded a net loss of $3 million on sales of assets and impairment of inventory in 2015 compared to a net gain of $9.1 million in 2014. The 2015 loss related primarily to the write-down of inventory to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value offset by gains on the sale of selected leases and wells in South Louisiana in September 2015, the release of sales proceeds previously held in escrow pending resolution of title requirements associated with the sale of certain non-core Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets sold in March 2014, the sale of leases in Oklahoma in May and June 2015, and the sale of selected wells in Martin and Yoakum Counties, Texas in March 2015. The 2014 gain related primarily to the sale of the certain non-core Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets sold in March 2014 and the sale of a property in Ward County, Texas in February 2014. Gain on sales of assets are included in other operating revenues and loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory are included in other operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nIncome taxes\nOur estimated federal and state effective income tax rate in 2015 of 36% differed from the statutory federal rate of 35% due primarily to increases related to the effects of the Texas Margin Tax and certain non-deductible expenses, offset in part by tax benefits derived from excess statutory depletion deductions.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nThe following discussion compares our results for the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2013. Unless otherwise indicated, references to 2014 and 2013 within this section refer to the respective annual periods.\nOil and gas operating results\nOil and gas sales, excluding amortized deferred revenues, increased $19.4 million, or 5% in 2014, from 2013. Production variances accounted for $50.3 million of the increase, and price variances accounted for a decrease of $30.9 million. Oil and gas sales in 2014 also includes $7.7 million of amortized deferred revenue versus $8.7 million in 2013 attributable to the VPP. Reported production and related average realized sales prices exclude volumes associated with the VPP. Before giving effect to the sale of our interests in selected leases and wells in South Louisiana in September 2015, our interests in certain non-core Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets in March 2014, and the Andrews County Wolfberry assets in April 2013, oil, gas and NGL production in 2014\n(on a BOE basis) increased 10% compared to 2013. Oil production increased 14% in 2014 from 2013, NGL production increased 10% while gas production decreased 5% in 2014 from 2013. After giving effect to the asset sales discussed above, oil, gas and NGL production in 2014 (on a BOE basis) increased 21% compared to 2013. Oil production increased 28% in 2014 from 2013, NGL production increased 20%, while gas production decreased 2% in 2014 from 2013. Our production mix continued to move favorably from 80% oil and NGL in 2013 to 83% in 2014. In 2014, our realized oil price declined 9% compared to 2013, and our realized gas price increased 21%. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile.\nProduction costs, consisting of lease operating expenses, production taxes and other miscellaneous marketing costs, decreased 3% to $105.3 million in 2014, as compared to $108.4 million in 2013, due primarily to a reduction in operating costs associated with the Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford and Andrews County Wolfberry sales, offset in part by increased production taxes related to the increase in oil and gas sales.\nOil and gas depletion expense increased $5.2 million from 2013 to 2014 due to a $13.2 million increase related to production variances and an $8 million decrease due to rate variances. On a BOE basis, depletion expense decreased 5% to $24.73 per BOE in 2014 from $26.13 per BOE in 2013. Depletion expense per BOE of oil and gas production is an operating metric that is indicative of our weighted average cost to find or acquire a unit of equivalent production. We may realize higher oil and gas depletion rates in future periods if our exploration and development activities result in higher finding costs.\nWe recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of $12 million during 2014, as compared to $89.8 million in 2013. The 2014 impairment related to certain non-core properties located in the Permian Basin and North Dakota to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair values. The transaction to monetize our Andrews County Wolfberry assets in April 2013 triggered the assessment of a non-cash charge of $69.5 million in the first quarter of 2013 and the remainder related to write-downs during the year of certain non-core Permian Basin properties to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair value.\nExploration costs\nWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting; therefore, our results of operations are adversely affected during any accounting period in which significant seismic costs, exploratory dry hole costs and unproved acreage impairments are expensed. In 2014, we charged to expense $23 million of exploration costs, as compared to $9.8 million in 2013. The increase was due to abandonment and impairment expense related primarily to unproved leasehold impairments in California and the abandonment of an exploratory well in South Louisiana.\nContract drilling services\nWe primarily utilize drilling rigs owned by our subsidiary, Desta Drilling, to drill wells in our exploration and development activities. Drilling services revenues received by Desta Drilling, along with the related drilling services costs pertaining to the net interest owned by CWEI, have been eliminated in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Drilling rig services revenue related to external customers was $28 million in 2014 compared to $17.8 million in 2013. Drilling services costs related to external customers were $19.2 million in 2014 compared to $16.3 million in 2013. Contract drilling depreciation for 2014 was $9.2 million compared to $11.3 million in 2013.\nGeneral and Administrative\nG&A expenses increased $1.2 million from $33.3 million in 2013 to $34.5 million in 2014. Changes in compensation expense attributable to our APO reward plans accounted for a net increase of $2.5 million ($4.6 million in 2014 versus $2.1 million in 2013). Most of the increase in expense in 2014 was related to changes in estimated future compensation expense associated with the Eagle Ford APO reward plan offset by lower professional costs.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased 18% from $43.1 million in 2013 to $50.9 million in 2014 due primarily to the issuance in October 2013 of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019.\nGain/loss on derivatives\nWe did not designate any derivative contracts in 2014 or 2013 as cash flow hedges; therefore, all cash settlements and changes resulting from mark-to-market valuations have been recorded as gain/loss on derivatives. In 2014, we reported a $4.8\nmillion gain on derivatives (including a $7.1 million gain on settled contracts). In 2013, we reported an $8.7 million loss on derivatives (net of a $0.7 million gain on settled contracts). Because oil and gas prices are volatile, and because we do not account for our derivatives as cash flow hedges, the effect of mark-to-market valuations on our gain/loss on derivatives can cause significant volatility in our results of operations.\nGain/loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory\nWe recorded a net gain of $9.1 million on sales of assets and impairment of inventory in 2014 compared to a net gain of $3 million in 2013. The 2014 gain related primarily to the sale of certain of the Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets sold in March 2014 and the sale of a property in Ward County, Texas in February 2014. The 2013 gain related primarily to the sale of our Andrews County, Texas properties in April 2013 and the sale of non-core properties located in Walker County, Texas in August 2013. Gain on sales of assets are included in other operating revenues and loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory are included in other operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nIncome taxes\nOur estimated federal and state effective income tax rate in 2014 of 36% differed from the statutory federal rate of 35% due primarily to increases related to the effects of the Texas Margin Tax and certain non-deductible expenses, offset in part by tax benefits derived from excess statutory depletion deductions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves. We pledge substantially all of our producing oil and gas properties to secure our obligations under the revolving credit facility and the term loan credit facility (see - Recent Developments and Outlook for 2016\u201d and - Term loan credit facility\u201d). The banks under the revolving credit facility establish a borrowing base, in part, by making an estimate of the collateral value of our oil and gas properties. We believe the term loans have provided us with a source of dedicated liquidity; however, we intend to borrow funds under the revolving credit facility as needed in the future to supplement our operating cash flow as a financing source for our capital expenditure program. Our ability to fund our capital expenditure program is dependent upon the level of product prices and the success of our exploration program in replacing our existing oil and gas reserves. If product prices decrease, our operating cash flow may decrease and the banks under the revolving credit facility may require additional collateral or reduce our borrowing base, thus reducing funds available to fund our capital expenditure program. However, we may mitigate the effects of product prices on our cash flow and borrowing base through the use of commodity derivatives.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $150 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility, leaving $298.1 million available on the facility after allowing for outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.9 million, as compared to $389.1 million of availability on the facility at December 31, 2014. Following the Refinancing, our pro forma indebtedness at December 31, 2015 was approximately $933 million, consisting of $333.2 million, net of $16.8 million original issue discount, under the term loan credit agreement and $599.8 million in outstanding principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes, net of unamortized discount. The Refinancing also added approximately $180 million of cash to the balance sheet.\nRecent Developments and Outlook for 2016\nThe severe downturn in oil prices that began in 2014 significantly reduced our cash flow from operations, causing us to suspend drilling operations in both of our core resource plays early in 2015 in order to preserve liquidity. Management quickly took decisive steps to reduce costs in an attempt to improve margins, but the combination of declining production attributable to suspended drilling activities and the impact of substantially lower oil and natural gas prices on cash flow led our senior management and the Board, beginning in early July 2015, to consider a variety of strategic and financial alternatives for the Company.\nIn August 2015, the Board formed a special committee comprising all four of our independent and disinterested directors to develop, explore and evaluate strategic alternatives for the Company, including potential transactions involving a business combination, a recapitalization, a sale of assets or securities of the Company, or an other extraordinary transaction. Goldman was engaged to serve as the Company's exclusive financial advisor in this process. The special committee also engaged independent legal counsel.\nWith the assistance of senior management, Goldman identified and contacted potential counterparties on a confidential basis to determine their interest in one or more of the strategic alternatives under consideration by the Company. The Company received indications of interest across all of these alternatives. Throughout the review process, the special committee reviewed\nindications of interest and other information with Goldman, senior management, legal counsel for the Company, and legal counsel for the special committee.\nIn mid-January 2016, final bids were submitted for various potential transactions, including proposals for secured debt financing. The special committee concluded that a secured debt alternative was favorable to the Company and its stockholders. In reaching this conclusion, the special committee considered, among other factors, that the secured debt alternative (1) avoided a sale of our core assets during a time of declining commodity prices, (2) provided a dedicated source of liquidity to fund our operations and development activities over the next two to three years, (3) limited immediate dilution to existing stockholders and (4) retained the opportunity to ultimately enhance shareholder value if the commodity environment improves. The special committee instructed Goldman to negotiate final proposals with these bidders, and following negotiations, the special committee and the Board unanimously selected the proposal submitted by Ares.\nOn March 8, 2016, we entered into (1) a credit agreement with Ares providing for the issuance of second lien term loans and common stock warrants and (2) an amendment to the revolving credit facility with our banks. Upon closing of the Refinancing on March 15, 2016, we issued term loans to Ares in the principal amount of $350 million, net of original issue discount of $16.8 million, for cash proceeds of $333.2 million. Concurrently, we issued warrants to purchase 2,251,364 shares of our common stock at a price of $22.00 per share to Ares for cash proceeds equal to the original issue discount from the issuance on the term loans. The warrants represent the right to acquire approximately 18.5% of our currently outstanding shares of common stock, or approximately 15.6% of our common shares on a fully exercised basis. In connection with the issuance of the warrants, we designated and issued to the initial warrant holders 3,500 shares of special voting preferred stock, $0.10 par value per share, granting them certain rights to elect two members of our Board. Aggregate cash proceeds from the transaction of approximately $340 million, net of transaction costs, were used to fully repay the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility of $160 million, plus accrued interest and fees, and added approximately $180 million of cash to our balance sheet to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations and future development.\nThe amendment to our revolving credit facility, among other things, reduced the borrowing base and aggregate lender commitments from $450 million to $100 million and modified the financial ratio covenant by (1) deleting the requirement that we maintain a specific ratio of consolidated EBITDAX to our consolidated net interest expense and (2) replacing the requirement that we maintain a varying ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDAX with a fixed ratio of our debt under the revolving credit facility to consolidated EBITDAX of 2.0 to 1.0. The Refinancing has provided us dedicated liquidity and allowed us to decrease debt under the revolving credit facility in order to meet the financial ratio covenant under that facility.\nThroughout our review process, oil prices fell dramatically, causing uncertainty and significant volatility in the debt and equity markets. We are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the downturn in commodity prices on our business, including the extent to which lower prices could affect our financial condition and liquidity. To mitigate the impact of further deterioration in prices, in January 2016 and March 2016, we entered into swaps covering an aggregate of 1,597 MBbls of our oil production for the period from January 2016 through June 2017 at prices ranging from $40.25 to $44.30 per barrel. In addition, we granted an option on an additional 739 MBbls of oil production from July 2016 through December 2016 at $40.25 per barrel exercisable by the counterparty by June 30, 2016.\nWhile we believe we are taking appropriate actions to preserve our short-term liquidity, the effects of a prolonged cycle of low operating margins on our business are significant since they reduce our cash flow from operations and diminish the present value of our oil and gas reserves. These factors have an adverse effect on our ability to access the capital resources we need to grow our reserve base.\nCapital expenditures\nThe following table summarizes, by area, our planned expenditures for exploration and development activities during 2016, as compared to our actual expenditures in 2015.\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Actual\nExpenditures\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Planned\nExpenditures\nYear Ending\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\nPercentage\nof Total Planned Expenditures\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Drilling and completion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Permian Basin Area:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Delaware Basin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>12,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford Shale\n</td> <td>37,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>7,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>94,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing and seismic\n</td> <td>29,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exploration and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur expenditures for exploration and development activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $124.5 million. We financed these expenditures in 2015 with cash flow from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales and advances under the revolving credit facility. Due to the downturn in oil prices, we currently plan to reduce spending on exploration and development activities in 2016 to approximately $65.7 million relating primarily to drill five wells in the Delaware Basin and participate in two non-operated wells. Our actual expenditures during 2016 may vary significantly from these estimates since our plans for exploration and development activities change during the year. Factors, such as changes in commodity prices, operating margins, drilling results and other factors, could increase or decrease our actual expenditures during 2016.\nBased on preliminary estimates, our internal cash flow forecasts indicate that our anticipated operating cash flows, combined with funds from our term loan credit facility and funds available to us under the revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our planned exploration and development activities at these reduced levels through 2016. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates made in our forecasts are reasonable, these forecasts are inherently uncertain and the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility may be less than expected, cash flows may be less than expected, or capital expenditures may be more than expected. We will consider options for obtaining alternative capital resources, including selling assets or accessing capital markets if necessary when we deem appropriate. Further significant and prolonged declines in prices could impact our ability to service our debt obligations and will further constrain our ability to use cash flows to drill to replace or increase our production and reserves.\nCash flow provided by operating activities\nSubstantially all of our cash flows from operating activities is derived from the production of our oil and gas reserves. We use these cash flows to fund our ongoing exploration and development activities in search of new oil and gas reserves. Variations in cash flows from operating activities may impact our level of exploration and development expenditures.\nCash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $206 million, or 80%, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014 due primarily to lower commodity prices in 2015.\nRevolving credit facility\nWe currently borrow money under a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of 16 banks led by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. On March 8, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility in connection with the Refinancing (see - Term loan credit facility\u201d). The amendment, among other things, reduced the borrowing base and the aggregate commitments of the lenders from $450 million to $100 million. The aggregate commitments may be increased to $150 million if we meet a minimum ratio of the discounted present value of our proved developed producing reserves to our debt under the revolving credit facility of 1.2 to 1.0. Increases in aggregate lender commitments require the consent of each lender.\nThe amendment also increased the applicable interest rates under our revolving credit facility by 0.75% at every borrowing base utilization level. At our election, interest under the revolving credit facility is determined by reference to (1) LIBOR plus an applicable margin between 2.5% and 3.5% per year or (2) the greatest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (C) one-month LIBOR plus 1% plus, in any of (A), (B) or (C), an applicable margin between 1.5% and 2.5% per year. We are also required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the commitments under the revolving credit facility of 0.5% per year. The applicable margin is determined based on the utilization of the borrowing base. Interest and fees are payable quarterly, except that interest on LIBOR-based tranches is due at maturity of each tranche but no less frequently than quarterly.\nThe revolving credit facility also contains various covenants and restrictive provisions that may, among other things, limit our ability to sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. One such covenant requires that we maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of at least 1 to1. The March 2016 amendment replaced a requirement that we maintain certain ratios of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDAX with a less restrictive ratio of debt outstanding solely under the revolving credit facility to consolidated EBITDAX of 2.0 to 1.0.\nThe revolving credit facility matures in April 2019 and is subject to an accelerated maturity date of October 1, 2018 unless our existing 2019 Senior Notes are refinanced or extended in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit facility prior to October 1, 2018.\nThe borrowing base, which is based on the discounted present value of future net cash flows from oil and gas production, is redetermined by the banks semi-annually in May and November. We or the banks may also request an unscheduled borrowing base redetermination at other times during the year. If, at any time, the borrowing base is less than the amount of outstanding credit exposure under the revolving credit facility, we will be required to (1) provide additional security, (2) prepay the principal amount of the loans in an amount sufficient to eliminate the deficiency, (3) prepay the deficiency in not more than five equal monthly installments plus accrued interest, or (4) take any combination of options (1) through (3).\nThe revolving credit facility is collateralized by a first lien on substantially all of our assets, including at least 90% of the adjusted engineered value (as defined in the revolving credit facility) attributed to our proved oil and gas interests evaluated in determining the borrowing base. The obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by each of CWEI's material restricted domestic subsidiaries.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $150 million of borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility, leaving $298.1 million available after allowing for outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.9 million. The effective annual interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility, excluding bank fees and amortization of debt issue costs, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 2.2%. We were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Under current commodities pricing, we expect that we will be in compliance with all financial covenants through 2016. Further deterioration in commodities pricing, however, could result in non-compliance and cause us to seek to negotiate revisions to our loan covenants, which relief may not be obtainable from our bank lenders.\nThe failure to comply with the foregoing covenants will constitute an event of default (subject, in the case of certain covenants, to applicable notice and/or cure periods) under the revolving credit facility. Other events of default under the revolving credit facility include, among other things, (1) the failure to timely pay principal, interest, fees or other amounts due and owing, (2) the inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, (3) the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, and (4) the loss of lien perfection or priority. The occurrence and continuance of an event of default could result in, among other things, acceleration of all amounts outstanding.\nWorking capital computed for loan compliance purposes differs from our working capital computed in accordance with GAAP. Since compliance with financial covenants is a material requirement under the revolving credit facility, we consider the loan compliance working capital to be useful as a measure of our liquidity because it includes the funds available to us under the revolving credit facility and is not affected by the volatility in working capital caused by changes in fair value of derivatives. Our GAAP reported working capital was $3 million at December 31, 2015 from a working capital deficit of $23.7 million at December 31, 2014. After giving effect to the adjustments, our working capital computed for loan compliance purposes was $301.2 million at December 31, 2015, as compared to $365.4 million at December 31, 2014.\nThe following table reconciles our GAAP working capital (deficit) to the working capital computed for loan compliance purposes at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital (deficit) per GAAP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(23,733\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add funds available under the revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>298,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>389,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Exclude fair value of derivatives classified as current assets or current liabilities\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital per loan covenant\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>301,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>365,397\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a condition to borrowing funds or issuing letters of credit under our revolving credit facility, we must remain in compliance with the financial and non-financial covenants, including financial ratios, in our revolving credit facility, as amended to date. We also must make certain representations and warranties to our bank lenders at the time of each borrowing. We were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. However, if we increase leverage and our liquidity is reduced, we may fail to comply with one or more of these covenants in the future. If we fail to meet any of these loan covenants, we would ask the banks to waive compliance, amend the revolving credit facility to allow us to become compliant or grant us sufficient time to obtain additional capital resources through alternative means. Although we believe our bank lenders are well secured under the terms of our revolving credit facility, there is no assurance that the bank lenders will waive or amend our covenants or other conditions to further lending. If a suitable arrangement could not be reached with the banks, the banks could accelerate the indebtedness and seek to foreclose on the pledged assets.\nThe lending group under the revolving credit facility includes the following institutions: JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., MUFG Union Bank, N.A., Compass Bank, Frost Bank, Toronto Dominion (Texas) LLC, KeyBank National Association, Natixis, New York Branch, UBS AG, Stamford Branch, Fifth Third Bank, U.S. Bank National Association, Whitney Bank, Bank of America, N.A., Branch Banking and Trust Company, Capital One, National Association and PNC Bank, National Association.\nFrom time to time, we engage in other transactions with lenders under the revolving credit facility. Such lenders or their affiliates may serve as counterparties to our commodity and interest rate derivative agreements. As of March 2016, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was the counterparty to our commodity derivative agreements. Our obligations under derivative agreements with our lenders are secured by the security documents executed by the parties under the revolving credit facility.\nTerm loan credit facility\nOn March 8, 2016, we entered into (1) a credit agreement with Ares providing for the issuance of second lien term loans and common stock warrants and (2) an amendment to the revolving credit facility with our banks. Upon closing of the Refinancing on March 15, 2016, we issued term loans to Ares in the principal amount of $350 million, net of original issue discount of $16.8 million, for cash proceeds of $333.2 million. Concurrently, we issued warrants to purchase 2,251,364 shares of our common stock at a price of $22.00 per share to Ares for cash proceeds equal to the original issue discount from the issuance on the term loans. The warrants represent the right to acquire approximately 18.5% of our currently outstanding shares of common stock, or approximately 15.6% of our common shares on a fully exercised basis. In connection with the issuance of the warrants, we designated and issued to the initial warrant holders 3,500 shares of special voting preferred stock, $0.10 par value per share, granting them certain rights to elect two members of our Board. Aggregate cash proceeds from the transaction of approximately $340 million, net of transaction costs, were used to fully repay the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility of $160 million, plus accrued interest and fees, and added approximately $180 million of cash to our balance sheet to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations and future development (see Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nInterest on the term loans is payable quarterly in cash at 12.5% per year; however, during the period from March 15, 2016 through March 31, 2018, we may elect to pay interest for any quarter in kind at 15% per year. We have agreed in advance to pay interest for the period commencing from March 15, 2016 and ending March 31, 2016 in cash, and have elected to pay interest for the quarterly period ending June 30, 2016 in kind.\nThe term loan credit facility matures on March 15, 2021, but is subject to an earlier maturity on December 31, 2018, if we do not extend or refinance our existing 2019 Senior Notes on or prior to that date.\nThe term loan credit facility is collateralized by a second lien on substantially all of our assets, including at least 90% of the adjusted engineered value (as defined in the term loan credit facility) attributed to our proved oil and gas interests. The obligations under the term loan credit facility are guaranteed by each of CWEI's material restricted domestic subsidiaries. Optional and mandatory prepayments made prior to September 15, 2020 are subject to make-whole or prepayment premiums.\nThe term loan credit facility also contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which may, among other things, limit our ability to sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. One such covenant requires that we maintain an asset-to-secured debt coverage ratio as of each December 31 and June 30 of each year, beginning with December 31, 2018, of at least 1.2 to 1.0. Under current commodities pricing, we expect that we will be in compliance with all financial covenants through 2016. Further deterioration in commodities pricing, however, could result in non-compliance and cause us to seek to negotiate revisions to our loan covenants, which relief may not be obtainable from our bank lenders.\nThe failure to comply with these covenants will constitute an event of default (subject, in the case of certain covenants, to applicable notice and/or cure periods) under the term loan credit facility. Other events of default under the term loan credit facility include, among other things, (1) the failure to timely pay principal, interest, fees or other amounts due and owing, (2) the inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, (3) the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, and (4) the loss of lien perfection or priority. The occurrence and continuance of an event of default could result in, among other things, acceleration of all amounts outstanding.\nSenior Notes\nIn March 2011, we issued $300 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes. The 2019 Senior Notes, which are unsecured, were issued at par and bear interest at 7.75% per year, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. In April 2011, we issued an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes with an original issue discount of 1% or $0.5 million. In October 2013, we issued an additional $250 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes at par to yield 7.75% to maturity. All of the 2019 Senior Notes are treated as a single class of debt securities under the same indenture. We may redeem some or all of the 2019 Senior Notes at redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) equal to 101.938% beginning on April 1, 2016 and 100% beginning on April 1, 2017 or for any period thereafter, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe Indenture contains covenants that restrict our ability to: (1) borrow money; (2) issue redeemable or preferred stock; (3) pay distributions or dividends; (4) make investments; (5) create liens without securing the 2019 Senior Notes; (6) enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries; (7) sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies; (8) enter into transactions with affiliates; (9) guarantee indebtedness; and (10) enter into new lines of business. One such covenant provides that, with certain exceptions, we may incur indebtedness if the ratio of consolidated EBITDAX to consolidated interest expense (as these terms are defined in the Indenture) exceeds 2.25 times. While we met this ratio as of December 31, 2015, if we do not meet this ratio in the future, in order to borrow under our revolving credit facility or make other borrowings, we expect to rely primarily on a covenant provision permitting the incurrence of indebtedness under a Credit Facility (as defined in the Indenture) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the greater of (a) $500 million and (b) 30% of Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as defined in the Indenture). These covenants are subject to a number of additional important exceptions and qualifications as described in the Indenture. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nAsset Sales\nFrom time to time, we sell certain of our proved and unproved properties when we believe it is more advantageous to dispose of the selected properties than to continue to hold them. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we received cash proceeds aggregating $71.5 million from various asset sales including the sale under a three-year term assignment in December 2015 of certain acreage in Burleson County, Texas for $21.8 million, the sale in June 2015 pursuant to a term assignment of certain acreage in Burleson County, Texas for $22.1 million and a sale in September 2015 of our interests in selected leases and wells in South Louisiana for $11.8 million. We are actively considering other selected sales as a source of additional funds to supplement cash flow from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan credit facility to meet our capital needs.\nAlternative capital resources\nWe believe we currently have adequate liquidity to enable us to fund our expected capital expenditures for 2016 through a combination of (1) cash on hand made available by the Refinancing, (2) cash flow from operations, and (3) borrowings under the revolving credit facility.\nSubject to any restrictions in the revolving credit facility and the term loan credit facility, we may also use other capital resources, including (1) entering into joint venture participation agreements with other industry or financial partners in our core development areas, (2) monetizing all or a portion of our core or non-core assets and (3) issuing additional debt or equity securities in private or public offerings, in order to finance a portion of our capital spending in fiscal 2016 and subsequent periods. While we believe we would be able to obtain funds through one or more of these alternative capital resources, if needed, there can be no assurance that these capital resources would be available on terms acceptable to us.\nContractual obligations and contingent commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 by payment due date.\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\nto\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\nto\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7.75% Senior Notes, due 2019, net of discount of $241(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>599,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>599,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility, due April 2019(a)\n</td> <td>150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations(b)\n</td> <td>6,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations(c)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>756,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>750,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>______\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) In addition to the principal payments presented, we expect to make annual interest payments of $47.1 million on the 2019 Senior Notes. \n (b) Amount includes lease payments for two drilling rigs. \n (c) Following the Refinancing, our pro forma indebtedness at December 31, 2015 was approximately $933 million, consisting of $333.2 million, net of $16.8 million original issue discount, under the term loan credit agreement and $599.8 million in outstanding principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes, net of unamortized discount. In addition to the principal payments presented, we expect to pay interest on the term loans in cash at 12.5% per year or, at our option, subject to certain restrictions, in kind at 15% per year. \nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nCurrently, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nOperating Margins\nWe analyze, on a BOE produced basis, those revenues and expenses that have a significant impact on our oil and gas operating margins. Our weighted average oil and gas sales per BOE have declined from $76.11 per BOE in 2013, to $72.59 per BOE in 2014 and $37.67 per BOE in 2015. Our oil and gas depletion per BOE fluctuated from $26.13 per BOE in 2013, to $24.73 per BOE in 2014 and $25.54 per BOE in 2015. Our production costs per BOE have decreased from $20.63 per BOE in 2013, to $18.27 per BOE in 2014 and $15.17 per BOE in 2015. The decrease in operating costs per BOE in 2015 from 2013 was due primarily to lower costs of field services, decreased production taxes resulting from lower commodity prices in 2015 and a reduction in production costs associated with the sale of non-core assets.\nOil and Gas Production\nAs with all companies engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, we face the challenge of natural production decline because oil and gas reserves are a depletable resource. With each unit of oil and gas we produce, we are depleting our proved reserve base, so we must be able to conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties with proved reserves in order to grow our reserve base. Our production in 2015 remained unchanged at 5.8 MMBOE compared to 2014, and we replaced 61% of our 2015 oil and gas production through extensions and discoveries. While these 2015 reserve additions will contribute favorably to our production in 2016, we do not expect this production to be sufficient to fully offset the natural production declines from our existing base of oil and gas reserves.\nWe currently plan to decrease capital spending during 2016 to $65.7 million on exploration and development activities compared to $124.5 million in 2015. Failure to maintain or grow our oil and gas reserves may result in lower production and may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nImpact of Downturn in Oil Prices\nOur business is subject to various trends and uncertainties, the most significant of which are related to commodity prices. The severe downturn in oil prices that began late in 2014 significantly reduced our cash flow from operations, causing us to suspend drilling operations in both of our core resource plays early in 2015 in order to preserve liquidity. Management quickly took decisive steps to reduce costs in an attempt to improve margins, but the combination of declining production attributable to suspended drilling activities and the impact of substantially lower oil and natural gas prices on cash flow will continue to have an adverse effect on our business if the downturn is prolonged.\nFurther significant and prolonged declines in prices could impact our ability to service our debt obligations and will further constrain our ability to use cash flows to drill to replace or increase our production and reserves.\nTo mitigate the impact of further deterioration in prices, we entered into swaps covering 1,597 MBbls of our oil production for the period from January 2016 through June 2017 at prices ranging from $40.25 to $44.30 per barrel. In addition, we granted an option on an additional 739 MBbls of oil production from July 2016 through December 2016 at $40.25 per barrel exercisable by the counterparty by June 30, 2016.\nLow commodity prices also have an adverse impact on our oil and gas reserves. In our evaluation of year-end 2015 reserves, management took into account its outlook for future oil and natural gas prices and the availability of financial resources, including the Refinancing in March 2016, to assess the future development plan for our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015. Considering the potential for an extended low product price environment, we did not schedule any proved undeveloped locations for drilling in 2016 or 2017. Based on our current long-term outlook for improved commodity prices and our reasonable expectations for access to adequate financing required to fund future drilling, we scheduled for 2018 through 2020 aggregate future capital spending for proved undeveloped locations of $135.7 million with associated reserves of 10,196 MBOE for year-end 2015. Substantially all of these proved undeveloped locations are located in our core Delaware Basin play in Reeves County, Texas. An additional $0.8 million of estimated future capital spending and 93 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves is attributable to our general partner interest in an affiliated partnership, which is proportionately consolidated in our financial statements. This assessment also resulted in the downgrade of 9,561 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to probable reserves at year-end 2015. If commodity prices do not improve to levels sufficient to support future drilling, future assessments could result in a reduction in development capital expenditures and additional downgrades of proved undeveloped reserves.\nThe prolonged effects of lower oil prices, declining production and lower proved reserves may have an adverse effect on our ability to access the capital resources we need to grow our reserve base. If we continue limited drilling activities for a significant period of time, or if our future access to capital resources is limited, we will also likely further delay our development of our proved undeveloped reserves or ultimately suspend such development, which could result in further reductions in undeveloped reserves.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSummary\nIn this section, we will identify the critical accounting policies we follow in preparing our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. Many of these policies require us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments in the course of making estimates of matters that are inherently imprecise. We explain the nature of these estimates, assumptions and judgments, and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported in our consolidated financial statements under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nThe following table lists our critical accounting policies, the estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the application of these accounting policies and the financial statement accounts affected by these estimates and assumptions.\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounting Policies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimates or Assumptions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Accounts Affected\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Successful efforts accounting for oil and gas properties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Reserve estimates\n\u00b7 Valuation of unproved properties\n\u00b7 Judgment regarding status of in progress exploratory wells\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Oil and gas properties\n\u00b7 Accumulated DD&A\n\u00b7 Provision for DD&A\n\u00b7 Impairment of unproved properties\n\u00b7 Abandonment costs (dry hole costs)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of proved properties and long-lived assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Reserve estimates and related present value of future net revenues (proved properties)\n\u00b7 Estimates of future undiscounted cash flows (long-lived assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Oil and gas properties\n\u00b7 Contract drilling equipment\n\u00b7 Accumulated DD&A\n\u00b7 Impairment of proved properties and long-lived assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Estimates of the present value of future abandonment costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Asset retirement obligations (non-current liability)\n\u00b7 Oil and gas properties\n\u00b7 Accretion of discount expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory stated at the lower of average cost or estimated market value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Estimates of market value of tubular goods and other well equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Impairment of inventory\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivatives mark-to-market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Estimates of the fair value of derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\u00b7 Fair value of derivatives\n\u00b7 Other income (expense): Gain (loss) on derivatives\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSignificant Estimates and Assumptions\nOil and gas reserves\nReserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of a reserve estimate depends on the quality of available geological and engineering data, the precision of and the interpretation of that data and judgment based on experience and training. Annually, we engage independent petroleum engineering firms to evaluate our oil and gas reserves. As a part of this process, our internal reservoir engineer and the independent petroleum engineers exchange information and attempt to reconcile any material differences in estimates and assumptions.\nThe techniques used in estimating reserves usually depend on the nature and extent of available data, and the accuracy of the estimates may vary accordingly. As a general rule, the degree of accuracy of reserve estimates varies with the reserve classification and the related accumulation of available data, as shown in the following table.\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Type of Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Nature of Available Data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Degree of Precision\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proved undeveloped\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Data from offsetting wells, geologic data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Least precise\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proved developed non-producing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Logs, core samples, well tests, pressure data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More precise\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proved developed producing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Production history, pressure data over time\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Most precise\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAssumptions as to future commodity prices and operating and capital costs also play a significant role in estimating oil and gas reserves and the estimated present value of the cash flows to be received from the future production of those reserves. Volumes of recoverable reserves are affected by the assumed prices and costs due to what is known as the economic limit (that point in the future when the projected costs and expenses of producing recoverable reserves exceed the projected revenues from the reserves). But more significantly, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is extremely sensitive to prices and costs, and may vary materially based on different assumptions. Current SEC financial accounting and reporting standards require that pricing parameters be the arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the 12-month period preceding the effective date of the reserve report. Varying pricing can result in significant changes in reserves and standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from period to period, as illustrated in the following table.\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Proved Reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Standardized\nMeasure of Discounted Future\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Oil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Natural Gas Liquids\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Oil\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Natural Gas Liquids\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(MMBbls)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(MMBbls)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Bcf)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($/Bbl)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($/Bbl)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($/Mcf)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Cash Flows\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>33.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>390.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>53.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>932.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013\n</td> <td>48.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>926.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nValuation of unproved properties\nEstimating fair market value of unproved properties (also known as prospects) is very subjective since there is no quoted market for undeveloped exploratory prospects. The negotiated price of any prospect between a willing seller and willing buyer depends on the specific facts regarding the prospect, including:\n \u2022 the location of the prospect in relation to known fields and reservoirs, available markets and transportation systems for oil and gas production in the vicinity and other critical services; \n \u2022 the nature and extent of geological and geophysical data on the prospect; \n \u2022 the terms of the leases holding the acreage in the prospect, such as ownership interests, expiration terms, royalty interests, delay rental obligations, depth limitations, drilling and marketing restrictions, continuous development obligations, and similar terms; \n \u2022 the prospect's risk-adjusted potential for return on investment, giving effect to such factors as potential reserves to be discovered, drilling and completion costs, prevailing commodity prices and other economic factors; and \n \u2022 the results of drilling activity in close proximity to the prospect that could either enhance or condemn the prospect's chances of success. \nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe estimate the present value of the amount we will incur to plug, abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives, in accordance with applicable state laws. We compute our liability for asset retirement obligations\nby calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows related to each property. This requires us to use significant assumptions, including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs, annual inflation of these costs, the productive lives of wells and our risk-adjusted interest rate. Changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligations.\nEffects of Estimates and Assumptions on Financial Statements\nGAAP does not require, or even permit, the restatement of previously issued financial statements due to changes in estimates unless such estimates were unreasonable or did not comply with applicable SEC accounting rules. We are required to use our best judgment in making estimates and assumptions, taking into consideration the best and most current data available to us at the time of the estimate. At each accounting period, we make a new estimate using new data, and continue the cycle. You should be aware that estimates prepared at various times may be substantially different due to new or additional data. While an estimate made at one point in time may differ from an estimate made at a later date, both may be proper due to the differences in available data or assumptions. In this section, we will discuss the effects of different estimates on our consolidated financial statements.\nProvision for DD&A\nWe compute our provision for DD&A on a unit-of-production method. Each quarter, we use the following formulas to compute the provision for DD&A for each of our producing properties (or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities):\n \u2022 DD&A Rate = Unamortized Cost / Beginning of Period Reserves \n \u2022 Provision for DD&A = DD&A Rate x Current Period Production \nReserve estimates have a significant impact on the DD&A rate. If reserve estimates for a property or group of properties are revised downward in future periods, the DD&A rate for that property or group of properties will increase as a result of the revision. Alternatively, if reserve estimates are revised upward, the DD&A rate will decrease.\nImpairment of Unproved Properties\nEach quarter, we review our unproved oil and gas properties to determine if there has been, in our judgment, an impairment in value of each prospect that we consider individually significant. To the extent that the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated value, we make a provision for impairment of unproved properties and record the provision as abandonments and impairments within exploration costs on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). If the value is revised upward in a future period, we do not reverse the prior provision, and we continue to carry the prospect at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value. If the value is revised downward in a future period, an additional provision for impairment is made in that period.\nImpairment of Proved Properties and Long-Lived Assets\nEach quarter, we assess our producing properties for impairment. If we determine there has been an impairment in any of our producing properties (or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities), we will estimate the value of each affected property. In accordance with GAAP, the value for this purpose is a fair value using Level 3 inputs instead of a standardized reserve value as prescribed by the SEC. We attempt to value each property using reserve classifications and pricing parameters similar to what a willing seller and willing buyer might use. These parameters may include escalations of prices instead of constant pricing, and they may also include the risk-adjusted value of reserves. To the extent that the carrying cost for the affected property exceeds its estimated fair value, we make a provision for impairment of proved properties. If the fair value is revised upward in a future period, we do not reverse the prior provision, and we continue to carry the property at a net cost that is lower than its estimated fair value. If the fair value is revised downward in a future period, an additional provision for impairment is made in that period. Accordingly, the carrying costs of producing properties on our balance sheet will vary from (and often will be less than) the present value of proved reserves for these properties.\nJudgment Regarding Status of In-Progress Wells\nOn a quarterly basis, we review the status of each in-progress well to determine the proper accounting treatment under the successful efforts method of accounting. Cumulative costs on in-progress wells remain capitalized until their productive status becomes known. If an in-progress exploratory well is found to be unsuccessful (often referred to as a dry hole) prior to the issuance of our consolidated financial statements, we write-off all costs incurred through the balance sheet date to abandonments and\nimpairments expense, a component of exploration costs. Costs incurred on that dry hole after the balance sheet date are charged to exploration costs in the period incurred.\nOccasionally, we are unable to make a final determination about the productive status of a well prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements. In these cases, we leave the well classified as in-progress until we have had sufficient time to conduct additional completion or testing operations and to evaluate the pertinent geological and geophysical and engineering data obtained. At the time when we are able to make a final determination of a well's productive status, the well is removed from the in-progress status and the proper accounting treatment is recorded.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOur asset retirement obligations are recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset's inception, with an offsetting increase to oil and gas properties. Periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). During 2015, we had an upward revision of our estimated asset retirement obligations of $3.1 million based on a review of current plugging and abandonment costs. Revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to producing properties, resulting in prospective changes to DD&A expense and accretion expense. Because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells, the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).\u201d The main difference between the current requirement under GAAP and ASU 2016-02 is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current operating leases) while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current capital leases). Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-02 must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. Transaction will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. We are evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes.\u201d This ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The standard will be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption will be permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. This standard may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities or retrospectively to all periods presented. Adoption of the new guidance will affect the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.\u201d This ASU requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied prospectively, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d that requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. An entity is required to apply ASU 2015-03 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. An entity should apply ASU 2015-03 on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. Upon transition, an entity is required to comply with the applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting principle. These disclosures include the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle, the transition method, a description of the prior-period information that has\nbeen retrospectively adjusted, and the effect of the change on the financial statement line items (that is, debt issuance cost asset and the debt liability). We currently present debt issuance costs on the balance sheet as an asset. As of December 31, 2015, we had $9.6 million of debt issuance costs, which under this standard would be reclassified from an asset to a direct deduction to the related debt liability.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\u201d that outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date\u201d, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. That new standard is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. An entity can apply ASU 2014-09 using either a full retrospective method, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or a modified retrospective method, meaning the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard is recognized in the most current period presented in the financial statements. We are evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion is intended to provide information relevant to an understanding of our financial condition, changes in our financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto.\nOverview\nWe have been committed to drilling primarily developmental oil wells in two primary oil-prone regions, the Permian Basin and the Giddings Area, where we have a significant inventory of developmental drilling opportunities. We spent approximately $50.5 million in the Wolfbone area in Reeves County, Texas in 2015 on drilling, completion and leasing activities and currently plan to spend approximately $53 million in this area in 2016. In 2015, we spent approximately $50.9 million on Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford Shale drilling and leasing activities and currently plan to spend approximately $10.7 million in this area in 2016.\nThe severe downturn in oil prices that began late in 2014 significantly reduced our cash flow from operations, causing us to suspend drilling operations in both of our core resource plays early in 2015 in order to preserve liquidity. Management quickly took decisive steps to reduce costs in an attempt to improve margins, but the combination of declining production attributable to suspended drilling activities and the impact of substantially lower oil and natural gas prices on cash flow will continue to have an adverse effect on our business if the downturn is prolonged.\nFurther significant and prolonged declines in prices could impact our ability to service our debt obligations and will further constrain our ability to use cash flows to drill to replace or increase our production and reserves.\nTo mitigate the impact of further deterioration in prices, we entered into swaps covering 1,597 MBbls of our oil production for the period from January 2016 through June 2017 at prices ranging from $40.25 to $44.30 per barrel. In addition, we granted an option on an additional 739 MBbls of oil production from July 2016 through December 2016 at $40.25 per barrel exercisable by the counterparty by June 30, 2016.\nLow commodity prices also have an adverse impact on our oil and gas reserves. In our evaluation of year-end 2015 reserves, management took into account its outlook for future oil and natural gas prices and the availability of financial resources, including the Refinancing in March 2016 (see - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Recent Developments and Outlook for 2016\u201d), to assess the future development plan for our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015. Considering the potential for an extended low product price environment, we did not schedule any proved undeveloped locations for drilling in 2016 or 2017. Based on our current long-term outlook for improved commodity prices and our reasonable expectations for access to adequate financing required to fund future drilling, we scheduled for 2018 through 2020 aggregate future capital spending for proved undeveloped locations of $135.7 million with associated reserves of 10,196 MBOE for year-end 2015. Substantially all of these proved undeveloped locations are located in our core Delaware Basin play in Reeves County, Texas. An additional $0.8 million of estimated future capital spending and 93 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves is attributable to our general partner interest in an affiliated partnership, which is proportionately consolidated in our financial statements. This assessment also resulted in the downgrade of 9,561 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to probable reserves at year-end 2015. If commodity prices do not improve to levels sufficient to support future drilling, future assessments could result in a reduction in development capital expenditures and additional downgrades of proved undeveloped reserves.\nThe prolonged effects of lower oil prices, declining production and lower proved reserves may have an adverse effect on our ability to access the capital resources we need to grow our reserve base. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a discussion of our current liquidity status and availability of capital, including the impact of the Refinancing. If we continue limited drilling activities for a significant period of time, or if our future access to capital resources is limited, we will likely further delay\nour development of our proved undeveloped reserves or ultimately suspend such development, which could result in further reductions in undeveloped reserves.\nKey Factors to Consider\nThe following summarizes the key factors considered by management in the review of our financial condition and operating performance for 2015.\n \u2022 The ongoing downturn in commodity prices continues to have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, having reduced our weighted average realized oil and gas prices by approximately 50% in fiscal 2015. As a result, we conducted limited drilling and completion activities in 2015 and expect to reduce capital spending further in 2016 pending an appreciable improvement in commodity prices. \n \u2022 Oil and gas sales, excluding amortized deferred revenues, decreased $197.7 million, or 48%, in 2015, from 2014. Price variances accounted for a decrease of $200.7 million and production variances accounted for an increase of $3 million. Average realized oil prices were $44.76 per barrel in 2015 versus $86.81 per barrel in 2014, average realized gas prices were $2.52 per Mcf in 2015 versus $4.35 per Mcf in 2014, and average realized NGL prices were $13.07 per barrel in 2015 versus $32.17 per barrel in 2014. Oil and gas sales in 2015 also includes $4.5 million of amortized deferred revenue versus $7.7 million in 2014 attributable to the VPP granted effective March 1, 2012. In August 2015, we terminated the VPP covering 277 MBOE of oil and gas production from August 2015 through December 2019 for $13.7 million. Reported production and related average realized sales prices exclude volumes associated with the VPP. \n \u2022 Oil, gas and NGL production per BOE remained unchanged in 2015 compared to 2014, with oil production increasing 2% to 11,663 barrels per day, gas production decreasing 2% to 15,885 Mcf per day and NGL production decreasing 6% to 1,507 barrels per day. Oil and NGL production accounted for approximately 83% of our total BOE production in 2015 and 2014. \n \u2022 Production costs decreased 17% from $105.3 million in 2014 to $87.6 million in 2015 due to reductions in production taxes associated with lower oil and gas sales, and reduced costs of field services. Production costs on a BOE basis, excluding production taxes, averaged $13.23 per BOE in 2015 versus $14.57 per BOE in 2014. \n \u2022 We recorded a $12.5 million gain on derivatives in 2015 (including a $12.5 million gain on settled contracts). For 2014, we recorded a $4.8 million gain on derivatives (including a $7.1 million gain on settled contracts). Since we do not presently designate our derivatives as cash flow hedges under applicable accounting standards, we recognize the full effect of changing prices on mark-to-market valuations as a current charge or credit to our results of operations. \n \u2022 Lower commodity prices also negatively impacted our results of operations due to asset impairments. During 2015, we recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of $41.9 million, of which $37.9 million related to the impairment of certain non-core properties in the Permian Basin and Oklahoma and $4 million related to the impairment of certain drilling rigs and related equipment to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair values. By comparison, we recorded an impairment of property and equipment in 2014 of $12 million related to certain non-core properties located in the Permian Basin and North Dakota to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair values. Also in 2015, we recorded charges to other operating expenses of $10.4 million for mark-to-market valuations of our tubular inventory and charges to other expense of $2.6 million to reducing the carrying value of our investment in Dalea Investment Group, LLC to its estimated fair value. \n \u2022 We recorded exploration expense related to abandonment and impairment costs during 2015 of $6.5 million compared to $20.6 million in 2014. The expense for 2015 includes a charge of $3.1 million for the abandonment of exploratory wells in South Louisiana and Oklahoma and $1.7 million related to unproved leasehold impairments in East Texas. By comparison, the expense for 2014 includes a charge of $11.3 million related to unproved leasehold impairments in California and Oklahoma and $4.4 million for the abandonment of exploratory wells in South Louisiana and Oklahoma. \n \u2022 General and administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses for 2015 were $22.8 million compared to $34.5 million in 2014. Changes in compensation expense attributable to our APO Reward Plans accounted for a net decrease of $4.6 million. The remaining decrease in expense was largely attributable to salary and personnel reductions. \n \u2022 Our estimated proved oil and gas reserves at December 31, 2015 decreased 38% to 46,569 MBOE from 75,430 MBOE at December 31, 2014. We replaced 61% of our oil and gas production in 2015 through extensions and discoveries of 3,542 MBOE, had net downward revisions of 26,158 MBOE and sales of minerals-in-place of 472 MBOE. \nOil and Gas Reserves\nTotal Proved Reserves\nThe following table summarizes changes in our estimated proved reserves during 2015.\n\nExtensions and discoveries. Extensions and discoveries in 2015 added 3,542 MBOE of proved reserves, replacing 61% of our 2015 production. These additions resulted primarily from our Delaware Basin program. Of the total reserve additions, proved developed reserves accounted for 2,648 MBOE, while the remaining 894 MBOE were proved undeveloped reserves.\nRevisions. The 26,158 MBOE net downward revisions in proved reserves resulted from a combination of (1) reclassifications of 9,561 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to probable reserves due solely to the SEC five-year development rule, (2) net upward revisions of 11,963 MBOE related primarily to performance in our Delaware Basin program and (3) downward revisions of 28,560 MBOE related to the effects of lower commodity prices on the estimated quantities of proved reserves.\nSales of minerals-in-place. We sold our interests in certain selected leases and wells in South Louisiana in September 2015 resulting in a decrease of 472 MBOE.\nProved Undeveloped Reserves\nSummary of changes in proved undeveloped reserves\nThe following table summarizes changes in our estimated proved undeveloped reserves during 2015.\n\nWe added 894 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves from extensions and discoveries related to Delaware Basin drilling locations. Net downward revisions of 21,610 MBOE resulted primarily from the combination of (1) reclassification of 9,561 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to probable reserves due solely to the SEC five-year development rule, (2) net upward revisions of 7,968 MBOE related to performance in our Delaware Basin program and (3) downward revisions of 20,017 MBOE related to the effects of lower commodity prices on the estimated quantities of proved reserves. We also converted 2,186 MBOE, or 6.6%, of our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2014 to proved developed reserves at a cost of approximately $45 million.\nSupplemental Information\nThe following unaudited information is intended to supplement the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K with data that is not readily available from those statements.\n\n\n\n\n (a) Natural gas reserves have been converted to oil equivalents at the ratio of six Mcf of gas to one Bbl of oil. \n (b) Oil and gas sales for 2015 includes $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 of amortized deferred revenue attributable to the VPP granted effective March 1, 2012. In August 2015, we terminated the VPP covering 277 MBOE of oil and gas production from August 2015 through December 2019 for $13.7 million. The calculation of average realized sales prices for 2015 excludes production of 53,026 barrels of oil and 35,735 Mcf of gas for the year ended December 31, 2015, 102,011 barrels of oil and 45,392 Mcf of gas for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 116,941 barrels of oil and 33,619 Mcf of gas for the year ended December 31, 2013 associated with the VPP. \n (c) No derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges in the table above. All gains or losses on settled derivatives were included in other income (expense) - gain (loss) on derivatives. \n (d) Following is a summary of the average daily production related to interests in producing properties we sold effective September 2015 (selected leases and wells in South Louisiana), March 2014 (non-core Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford) and April 2013 (Andrews County Wolfberry). \n\n (e) Excludes wells being drilled or completed at the end of each period. \nOperating Results\n2015 Compared to 2014\nThe following discussion compares our results for the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014. Unless otherwise indicated, references to 2015 and 2014 within this section refer to the respective annual periods.\nOil and gas operating results\nOil and gas sales, excluding amortized deferred revenues, decreased $197.7 million, or 48%, in 2015, from 2014. Price variances accounted for a $200.7 million decrease and production variances accounted for an increase of $3 million. Oil and gas sales in 2015 also includes $4.5 million of amortized deferred revenue versus $7.7 million in 2014 attributable to the VPP. In August 2015, we terminated the VPP covering 277 MBOE of oil and gas production from August 2015 through December 2019 for $13.7 million. Reported production and related average realized sales prices exclude volumes associated with the VPP through July 2015. Oil, gas and NGL production in 2015 (on a BOE basis) remained unchanged compared to 2014. Oil production increased 2% in 2015 from 2014 while NGL production decreased 6% and gas production decreased 2% in 2015 from 2014. After giving effect to the sale of our interests in selected leases and wells in South Louisiana in September 2015 and the sale of of certain non-core Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets in March 2014, oil, gas and NGL production in 2015 (on a BOE basis) increased 2% compared to 2014. Oil production increased 3% in 2015 from 2014, while NGL production decreased 6% and gas production decreased less than 1% in 2015 from 2014. The liquids component of our production mix accounted for approximately 83% oil and NGL in 2014 and 2015. In 2015, our realized oil price declined 48% compared to 2014, and our realized gas price decreased 42%. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile.\nProduction costs, consisting of lease operating expenses, production taxes and other miscellaneous marketing costs, decreased 17% to $87.6 million in 2015, as compared to $105.3 million in 2014, due to reductions in production taxes associated with lower oil and gas sales and reduced costs of field services. Production costs on a BOE basis, excluding production taxes, averaged $13.23 per BOE in 2015 compared to $14.57 per BOE in 2014.\nOil and gas depletion expense increased $4.9 million from 2014 to 2015 due to a $4.6 million increase related to rate variances and a $0.3 million increase due to production variances. On a BOE basis, depletion expense increased 3% to $25.54 per BOE in 2015 from $24.73 per BOE in 2014. Depletion expense per BOE of oil and gas production is an operating metric that is indicative of our weighted average cost to find or acquire a unit of equivalent production. We may realize higher oil and gas depletion rates in future periods if our exploration and development activities result in higher finding costs.\nWe recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of $41.9 million during 2015, as compared to $12 million in 2014. The 2015 impairment included a charge of $37.9 million related to primarily proved non-core properties located in the Permian Basin and Oklahoma and a charge of $4 million related to the impairment of certain drilling rigs and related equipment to reduce the carrying value to their estimated fair values. The 2014 impairment related to certain non-core properties located in the Permian Basin and North Dakota to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair values. Impairment of a proved property group is recognized when the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the property group are less than its carrying value. Assuming that commodity prices continue to decline, we may incur further asset impairments in 2016. Although it is difficult to provide an estimate because of the numerous variables and management input decisions required to evaluate the amount of any asset impairments, they could be significant.\nExploration costs\nWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting; therefore, our results of operations are adversely affected during any accounting period in which significant seismic costs, exploratory dry hole costs and unproved acreage impairments are expensed. In 2015, we charged to expense $7.8 million of exploration costs, as compared to $23 million in 2014. The expense for 2015 includes a charge of $3.1 million for the abandonment of exploratory wells in South Louisiana and Oklahoma and $1.7 million related to unproved leasehold impairments in East Texas. By comparison, the expense for 2014 includes a charge of $11.3 million related to unproved leasehold impairments in California and Oklahoma and $4.4 million for the abandonment of exploratory wells in South Louisiana and Oklahoma.\nContract drilling services\nWe primarily utilize drilling rigs owned by our subsidiary, Desta Drilling, to drill wells in our exploration and development activities. Drilling services revenues received by Desta Drilling, along with the related drilling services costs pertaining to the net interest owned by CWEI, have been eliminated in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nDrilling rig services revenue related to external customers was negligible in 2015 compared to $28 million in 2014 due to decreased demand for contract drilling services. Drilling services costs, net of eliminations, were $5.2 million in 2015 compared to $19.2 million in 2014. Contract drilling depreciation for 2015 was $12.2 million compared to $9.2 million in 2014. As discussed above, in 2015, we recorded an impairment of property and equipment of $4 million compared to none in 2014 related to the impairment of certain drilling rigs and related equipment to reduce the carrying value to their estimated fair values.\nGeneral and Administrative\nG&A expenses decreased $11.7 million from $34.5 million in 2014 to $22.8 million in 2015. Changes in compensation expense attributable to our APO reward plans accounted for a net decrease of $4.6 million. The remaining decrease in expense in 2015 was largely attributable to salary and personnel reductions.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased 7% from $50.9 million in 2014 to $54.4 million in 2015 due primarily to an increase in borrowings under the revolving credit facility, which increased from an average daily principal balance of $41 million in 2014 to $159.4 million in 2015.\nGain/loss on derivatives\nWe did not designate any derivative contracts in 2015 or 2014 as cash flow hedges; therefore, all cash settlements and changes resulting from mark-to-market valuations have been recorded as gain/loss on derivatives. In 2015, we reported a $12.5 million gain on derivatives (including a $12.5 million gain on settled contracts). In 2014, we reported a $4.8 million gain on derivatives (including a $7.1 million gain on settled contracts). Because oil and gas prices are volatile, and because we do not account for our derivatives as cash flow hedges, the effect of mark-to-market valuations on our gain/loss on derivatives can cause significant volatility in our results of operations.\nGain/loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory\nWe recorded a net loss of $3 million on sales of assets and impairment of inventory in 2015 compared to a net gain of $9.1 million in 2014. The 2015 loss related primarily to the write-down of inventory to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value offset by gains on the sale of selected leases and wells in South Louisiana in September 2015, the release of sales proceeds previously held in escrow pending resolution of title requirements associated with the sale of certain non-core Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets sold in March 2014, the sale of leases in Oklahoma in May and June 2015, and the sale of selected wells in Martin and Yoakum Counties, Texas in March 2015. The 2014 gain related primarily to the sale of the certain non-core Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets sold in March 2014 and the sale of a property in Ward County, Texas in February 2014. Gain on sales of assets are included in other operating revenues and loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory are included in other operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nIncome taxes\nOur estimated federal and state effective income tax rate in 2015 of 36% differed from the statutory federal rate of 35% due primarily to increases related to the effects of the Texas Margin Tax and certain non-deductible expenses, offset in part by tax benefits derived from excess statutory depletion deductions.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nThe following discussion compares our results for the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2013. Unless otherwise indicated, references to 2014 and 2013 within this section refer to the respective annual periods.\nOil and gas operating results\nOil and gas sales, excluding amortized deferred revenues, increased $19.4 million, or 5% in 2014, from 2013. Production variances accounted for $50.3 million of the increase, and price variances accounted for a decrease of $30.9 million. Oil and gas sales in 2014 also includes $7.7 million of amortized deferred revenue versus $8.7 million in 2013 attributable to the VPP. Reported production and related average realized sales prices exclude volumes associated with the VPP. Before giving effect to the sale of our interests in selected leases and wells in South Louisiana in September 2015, our interests in certain non-core Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets in March 2014, and the Andrews County Wolfberry assets in April 2013, oil, gas and NGL production in 2014\n(on a BOE basis) increased 10% compared to 2013. Oil production increased 14% in 2014 from 2013, NGL production increased 10% while gas production decreased 5% in 2014 from 2013. After giving effect to the asset sales discussed above, oil, gas and NGL production in 2014 (on a BOE basis) increased 21% compared to 2013. Oil production increased 28% in 2014 from 2013, NGL production increased 20%, while gas production decreased 2% in 2014 from 2013. Our production mix continued to move favorably from 80% oil and NGL in 2013 to 83% in 2014. In 2014, our realized oil price declined 9% compared to 2013, and our realized gas price increased 21%. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile.\nProduction costs, consisting of lease operating expenses, production taxes and other miscellaneous marketing costs, decreased 3% to $105.3 million in 2014, as compared to $108.4 million in 2013, due primarily to a reduction in operating costs associated with the Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford and Andrews County Wolfberry sales, offset in part by increased production taxes related to the increase in oil and gas sales.\nOil and gas depletion expense increased $5.2 million from 2013 to 2014 due to a $13.2 million increase related to production variances and an $8 million decrease due to rate variances. On a BOE basis, depletion expense decreased 5% to $24.73 per BOE in 2014 from $26.13 per BOE in 2013. Depletion expense per BOE of oil and gas production is an operating metric that is indicative of our weighted average cost to find or acquire a unit of equivalent production. We may realize higher oil and gas depletion rates in future periods if our exploration and development activities result in higher finding costs.\nWe recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of $12 million during 2014, as compared to $89.8 million in 2013. The 2014 impairment related to certain non-core properties located in the Permian Basin and North Dakota to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair values. The transaction to monetize our Andrews County Wolfberry assets in April 2013 triggered the assessment of a non-cash charge of $69.5 million in the first quarter of 2013 and the remainder related to write-downs during the year of certain non-core Permian Basin properties to reduce the carrying value of these properties to their estimated fair value.\nExploration costs\nWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting; therefore, our results of operations are adversely affected during any accounting period in which significant seismic costs, exploratory dry hole costs and unproved acreage impairments are expensed. In 2014, we charged to expense $23 million of exploration costs, as compared to $9.8 million in 2013. The increase was due to abandonment and impairment expense related primarily to unproved leasehold impairments in California and the abandonment of an exploratory well in South Louisiana.\nContract drilling services\nWe primarily utilize drilling rigs owned by our subsidiary, Desta Drilling, to drill wells in our exploration and development activities. Drilling services revenues received by Desta Drilling, along with the related drilling services costs pertaining to the net interest owned by CWEI, have been eliminated in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Drilling rig services revenue related to external customers was $28 million in 2014 compared to $17.8 million in 2013. Drilling services costs related to external customers were $19.2 million in 2014 compared to $16.3 million in 2013. Contract drilling depreciation for 2014 was $9.2 million compared to $11.3 million in 2013.\nGeneral and Administrative\nG&A expenses increased $1.2 million from $33.3 million in 2013 to $34.5 million in 2014. Changes in compensation expense attributable to our APO reward plans accounted for a net increase of $2.5 million ($4.6 million in 2014 versus $2.1 million in 2013). Most of the increase in expense in 2014 was related to changes in estimated future compensation expense associated with the Eagle Ford APO reward plan offset by lower professional costs.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased 18% from $43.1 million in 2013 to $50.9 million in 2014 due primarily to the issuance in October 2013 of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 7.75% Senior Notes due 2019.\nGain/loss on derivatives\nWe did not designate any derivative contracts in 2014 or 2013 as cash flow hedges; therefore, all cash settlements and changes resulting from mark-to-market valuations have been recorded as gain/loss on derivatives. In 2014, we reported a $4.8\nmillion gain on derivatives (including a $7.1 million gain on settled contracts). In 2013, we reported an $8.7 million loss on derivatives (net of a $0.7 million gain on settled contracts). Because oil and gas prices are volatile, and because we do not account for our derivatives as cash flow hedges, the effect of mark-to-market valuations on our gain/loss on derivatives can cause significant volatility in our results of operations.\nGain/loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory\nWe recorded a net gain of $9.1 million on sales of assets and impairment of inventory in 2014 compared to a net gain of $3 million in 2013. The 2014 gain related primarily to the sale of certain of the Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford assets sold in March 2014 and the sale of a property in Ward County, Texas in February 2014. The 2013 gain related primarily to the sale of our Andrews County, Texas properties in April 2013 and the sale of non-core properties located in Walker County, Texas in August 2013. Gain on sales of assets are included in other operating revenues and loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory are included in other operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nIncome taxes\nOur estimated federal and state effective income tax rate in 2014 of 36% differed from the statutory federal rate of 35% due primarily to increases related to the effects of the Texas Margin Tax and certain non-deductible expenses, offset in part by tax benefits derived from excess statutory depletion deductions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves. We pledge substantially all of our producing oil and gas properties to secure our obligations under the revolving credit facility and the term loan credit facility (see - Recent Developments and Outlook for 2016\u201d and - Term loan credit facility\u201d). The banks under the revolving credit facility establish a borrowing base, in part, by making an estimate of the collateral value of our oil and gas properties. We believe the term loans have provided us with a source of dedicated liquidity; however, we intend to borrow funds under the revolving credit facility as needed in the future to supplement our operating cash flow as a financing source for our capital expenditure program. Our ability to fund our capital expenditure program is dependent upon the level of product prices and the success of our exploration program in replacing our existing oil and gas reserves. If product prices decrease, our operating cash flow may decrease and the banks under the revolving credit facility may require additional collateral or reduce our borrowing base, thus reducing funds available to fund our capital expenditure program. However, we may mitigate the effects of product prices on our cash flow and borrowing base through the use of commodity derivatives.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $150 million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility, leaving $298.1 million available on the facility after allowing for outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.9 million, as compared to $389.1 million of availability on the facility at December 31, 2014. Following the Refinancing, our pro forma indebtedness at December 31, 2015 was approximately $933 million, consisting of $333.2 million, net of $16.8 million original issue discount, under the term loan credit agreement and $599.8 million in outstanding principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes, net of unamortized discount. The Refinancing also added approximately $180 million of cash to the balance sheet.\nRecent Developments and Outlook for 2016\nThe severe downturn in oil prices that began in 2014 significantly reduced our cash flow from operations, causing us to suspend drilling operations in both of our core resource plays early in 2015 in order to preserve liquidity. Management quickly took decisive steps to reduce costs in an attempt to improve margins, but the combination of declining production attributable to suspended drilling activities and the impact of substantially lower oil and natural gas prices on cash flow led our senior management and the Board, beginning in early July 2015, to consider a variety of strategic and financial alternatives for the Company.\nIn August 2015, the Board formed a special committee comprising all four of our independent and disinterested directors to develop, explore and evaluate strategic alternatives for the Company, including potential transactions involving a business combination, a recapitalization, a sale of assets or securities of the Company, or an other extraordinary transaction. Goldman was engaged to serve as the Company's exclusive financial advisor in this process. The special committee also engaged independent legal counsel.\nWith the assistance of senior management, Goldman identified and contacted potential counterparties on a confidential basis to determine their interest in one or more of the strategic alternatives under consideration by the Company. The Company received indications of interest across all of these alternatives. Throughout the review process, the special committee reviewed\nindications of interest and other information with Goldman, senior management, legal counsel for the Company, and legal counsel for the special committee.\nIn mid-January 2016, final bids were submitted for various potential transactions, including proposals for secured debt financing. The special committee concluded that a secured debt alternative was favorable to the Company and its stockholders. In reaching this conclusion, the special committee considered, among other factors, that the secured debt alternative (1) avoided a sale of our core assets during a time of declining commodity prices, (2) provided a dedicated source of liquidity to fund our operations and development activities over the next two to three years, (3) limited immediate dilution to existing stockholders and (4) retained the opportunity to ultimately enhance shareholder value if the commodity environment improves. The special committee instructed Goldman to negotiate final proposals with these bidders, and following negotiations, the special committee and the Board unanimously selected the proposal submitted by Ares.\nOn March 8, 2016, we entered into (1) a credit agreement with Ares providing for the issuance of second lien term loans and common stock warrants and (2) an amendment to the revolving credit facility with our banks. Upon closing of the Refinancing on March 15, 2016, we issued term loans to Ares in the principal amount of $350 million, net of original issue discount of $16.8 million, for cash proceeds of $333.2 million. Concurrently, we issued warrants to purchase 2,251,364 shares of our common stock at a price of $22.00 per share to Ares for cash proceeds equal to the original issue discount from the issuance on the term loans. The warrants represent the right to acquire approximately 18.5% of our currently outstanding shares of common stock, or approximately 15.6% of our common shares on a fully exercised basis. In connection with the issuance of the warrants, we designated and issued to the initial warrant holders 3,500 shares of special voting preferred stock, $0.10 par value per share, granting them certain rights to elect two members of our Board. Aggregate cash proceeds from the transaction of approximately $340 million, net of transaction costs, were used to fully repay the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility of $160 million, plus accrued interest and fees, and added approximately $180 million of cash to our balance sheet to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations and future development.\nThe amendment to our revolving credit facility, among other things, reduced the borrowing base and aggregate lender commitments from $450 million to $100 million and modified the financial ratio covenant by (1) deleting the requirement that we maintain a specific ratio of consolidated EBITDAX to our consolidated net interest expense and (2) replacing the requirement that we maintain a varying ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDAX with a fixed ratio of our debt under the revolving credit facility to consolidated EBITDAX of 2.0 to 1.0. The Refinancing has provided us dedicated liquidity and allowed us to decrease debt under the revolving credit facility in order to meet the financial ratio covenant under that facility.\nThroughout our review process, oil prices fell dramatically, causing uncertainty and significant volatility in the debt and equity markets. We are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the downturn in commodity prices on our business, including the extent to which lower prices could affect our financial condition and liquidity. To mitigate the impact of further deterioration in prices, in January 2016 and March 2016, we entered into swaps covering an aggregate of 1,597 MBbls of our oil production for the period from January 2016 through June 2017 at prices ranging from $40.25 to $44.30 per barrel. In addition, we granted an option on an additional 739 MBbls of oil production from July 2016 through December 2016 at $40.25 per barrel exercisable by the counterparty by June 30, 2016.\nWhile we believe we are taking appropriate actions to preserve our short-term liquidity, the effects of a prolonged cycle of low operating margins on our business are significant since they reduce our cash flow from operations and diminish the present value of our oil and gas reserves. These factors have an adverse effect on our ability to access the capital resources we need to grow our reserve base.\nCapital expenditures\nThe following table summarizes, by area, our planned expenditures for exploration and development activities during 2016, as compared to our actual expenditures in 2015.\n\nOur expenditures for exploration and development activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $124.5 million. We financed these expenditures in 2015 with cash flow from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales and advances under the revolving credit facility. Due to the downturn in oil prices, we currently plan to reduce spending on exploration and development activities in 2016 to approximately $65.7 million relating primarily to drill five wells in the Delaware Basin and participate in two non-operated wells. Our actual expenditures during 2016 may vary significantly from these estimates since our plans for exploration and development activities change during the year. Factors, such as changes in commodity prices, operating margins, drilling results and other factors, could increase or decrease our actual expenditures during 2016.\nBased on preliminary estimates, our internal cash flow forecasts indicate that our anticipated operating cash flows, combined with funds from our term loan credit facility and funds available to us under the revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance our planned exploration and development activities at these reduced levels through 2016. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates made in our forecasts are reasonable, these forecasts are inherently uncertain and the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility may be less than expected, cash flows may be less than expected, or capital expenditures may be more than expected. We will consider options for obtaining alternative capital resources, including selling assets or accessing capital markets if necessary when we deem appropriate. Further significant and prolonged declines in prices could impact our ability to service our debt obligations and will further constrain our ability to use cash flows to drill to replace or increase our production and reserves.\nCash flow provided by operating activities\nSubstantially all of our cash flows from operating activities is derived from the production of our oil and gas reserves. We use these cash flows to fund our ongoing exploration and development activities in search of new oil and gas reserves. Variations in cash flows from operating activities may impact our level of exploration and development expenditures.\nCash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased $206 million, or 80%, as compared to the corresponding period in 2014 due primarily to lower commodity prices in 2015.\nRevolving credit facility\nWe currently borrow money under a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of 16 banks led by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. On March 8, 2016, we entered into an amendment to the revolving credit facility in connection with the Refinancing (see - Term loan credit facility\u201d). The amendment, among other things, reduced the borrowing base and the aggregate commitments of the lenders from $450 million to $100 million. The aggregate commitments may be increased to $150 million if we meet a minimum ratio of the discounted present value of our proved developed producing reserves to our debt under the revolving credit facility of 1.2 to 1.0. Increases in aggregate lender commitments require the consent of each lender.\nThe amendment also increased the applicable interest rates under our revolving credit facility by 0.75% at every borrowing base utilization level. At our election, interest under the revolving credit facility is determined by reference to (1) LIBOR plus an applicable margin between 2.5% and 3.5% per year or (2) the greatest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (C) one-month LIBOR plus 1% plus, in any of (A), (B) or (C), an applicable margin between 1.5% and 2.5% per year. We are also required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the commitments under the revolving credit facility of 0.5% per year. The applicable margin is determined based on the utilization of the borrowing base. Interest and fees are payable quarterly, except that interest on LIBOR-based tranches is due at maturity of each tranche but no less frequently than quarterly.\nThe revolving credit facility also contains various covenants and restrictive provisions that may, among other things, limit our ability to sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. One such covenant requires that we maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of at least 1 to1. The March 2016 amendment replaced a requirement that we maintain certain ratios of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDAX with a less restrictive ratio of debt outstanding solely under the revolving credit facility to consolidated EBITDAX of 2.0 to 1.0.\nThe revolving credit facility matures in April 2019 and is subject to an accelerated maturity date of October 1, 2018 unless our existing 2019 Senior Notes are refinanced or extended in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit facility prior to October 1, 2018.\nThe borrowing base, which is based on the discounted present value of future net cash flows from oil and gas production, is redetermined by the banks semi-annually in May and November. We or the banks may also request an unscheduled borrowing base redetermination at other times during the year. If, at any time, the borrowing base is less than the amount of outstanding credit exposure under the revolving credit facility, we will be required to (1) provide additional security, (2) prepay the principal amount of the loans in an amount sufficient to eliminate the deficiency, (3) prepay the deficiency in not more than five equal monthly installments plus accrued interest, or (4) take any combination of options (1) through (3).\nThe revolving credit facility is collateralized by a first lien on substantially all of our assets, including at least 90% of the adjusted engineered value (as defined in the revolving credit facility) attributed to our proved oil and gas interests evaluated in determining the borrowing base. The obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by each of CWEI's material restricted domestic subsidiaries.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $150 million of borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility, leaving $298.1 million available after allowing for outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.9 million. The effective annual interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility, excluding bank fees and amortization of debt issue costs, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 2.2%. We were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Under current commodities pricing, we expect that we will be in compliance with all financial covenants through 2016. Further deterioration in commodities pricing, however, could result in non-compliance and cause us to seek to negotiate revisions to our loan covenants, which relief may not be obtainable from our bank lenders.\nThe failure to comply with the foregoing covenants will constitute an event of default (subject, in the case of certain covenants, to applicable notice and/or cure periods) under the revolving credit facility. Other events of default under the revolving credit facility include, among other things, (1) the failure to timely pay principal, interest, fees or other amounts due and owing, (2) the inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, (3) the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, and (4) the loss of lien perfection or priority. The occurrence and continuance of an event of default could result in, among other things, acceleration of all amounts outstanding.\nWorking capital computed for loan compliance purposes differs from our working capital computed in accordance with GAAP. Since compliance with financial covenants is a material requirement under the revolving credit facility, we consider the loan compliance working capital to be useful as a measure of our liquidity because it includes the funds available to us under the revolving credit facility and is not affected by the volatility in working capital caused by changes in fair value of derivatives. Our GAAP reported working capital was $3 million at December 31, 2015 from a working capital deficit of $23.7 million at December 31, 2014. After giving effect to the adjustments, our working capital computed for loan compliance purposes was $301.2 million at December 31, 2015, as compared to $365.4 million at December 31, 2014.\nThe following table reconciles our GAAP working capital (deficit) to the working capital computed for loan compliance purposes at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\n\nAs a condition to borrowing funds or issuing letters of credit under our revolving credit facility, we must remain in compliance with the financial and non-financial covenants, including financial ratios, in our revolving credit facility, as amended to date. We also must make certain representations and warranties to our bank lenders at the time of each borrowing. We were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. However, if we increase leverage and our liquidity is reduced, we may fail to comply with one or more of these covenants in the future. If we fail to meet any of these loan covenants, we would ask the banks to waive compliance, amend the revolving credit facility to allow us to become compliant or grant us sufficient time to obtain additional capital resources through alternative means. Although we believe our bank lenders are well secured under the terms of our revolving credit facility, there is no assurance that the bank lenders will waive or amend our covenants or other conditions to further lending. If a suitable arrangement could not be reached with the banks, the banks could accelerate the indebtedness and seek to foreclose on the pledged assets.\nThe lending group under the revolving credit facility includes the following institutions: JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., MUFG Union Bank, N.A., Compass Bank, Frost Bank, Toronto Dominion (Texas) LLC, KeyBank National Association, Natixis, New York Branch, UBS AG, Stamford Branch, Fifth Third Bank, U.S. Bank National Association, Whitney Bank, Bank of America, N.A., Branch Banking and Trust Company, Capital One, National Association and PNC Bank, National Association.\nFrom time to time, we engage in other transactions with lenders under the revolving credit facility. Such lenders or their affiliates may serve as counterparties to our commodity and interest rate derivative agreements. As of March 2016, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was the counterparty to our commodity derivative agreements. Our obligations under derivative agreements with our lenders are secured by the security documents executed by the parties under the revolving credit facility.\nTerm loan credit facility\nOn March 8, 2016, we entered into (1) a credit agreement with Ares providing for the issuance of second lien term loans and common stock warrants and (2) an amendment to the revolving credit facility with our banks. Upon closing of the Refinancing on March 15, 2016, we issued term loans to Ares in the principal amount of $350 million, net of original issue discount of $16.8 million, for cash proceeds of $333.2 million. Concurrently, we issued warrants to purchase 2,251,364 shares of our common stock at a price of $22.00 per share to Ares for cash proceeds equal to the original issue discount from the issuance on the term loans. The warrants represent the right to acquire approximately 18.5% of our currently outstanding shares of common stock, or approximately 15.6% of our common shares on a fully exercised basis. In connection with the issuance of the warrants, we designated and issued to the initial warrant holders 3,500 shares of special voting preferred stock, $0.10 par value per share, granting them certain rights to elect two members of our Board. Aggregate cash proceeds from the transaction of approximately $340 million, net of transaction costs, were used to fully repay the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility of $160 million, plus accrued interest and fees, and added approximately $180 million of cash to our balance sheet to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations and future development (see Note 19 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nInterest on the term loans is payable quarterly in cash at 12.5% per year; however, during the period from March 15, 2016 through March 31, 2018, we may elect to pay interest for any quarter in kind at 15% per year. We have agreed in advance to pay interest for the period commencing from March 15, 2016 and ending March 31, 2016 in cash, and have elected to pay interest for the quarterly period ending June 30, 2016 in kind.\nThe term loan credit facility matures on March 15, 2021, but is subject to an earlier maturity on December 31, 2018, if we do not extend or refinance our existing 2019 Senior Notes on or prior to that date.\nThe term loan credit facility is collateralized by a second lien on substantially all of our assets, including at least 90% of the adjusted engineered value (as defined in the term loan credit facility) attributed to our proved oil and gas interests. The obligations under the term loan credit facility are guaranteed by each of CWEI's material restricted domestic subsidiaries. Optional and mandatory prepayments made prior to September 15, 2020 are subject to make-whole or prepayment premiums.\nThe term loan credit facility also contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which may, among other things, limit our ability to sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens. One such covenant requires that we maintain an asset-to-secured debt coverage ratio as of each December 31 and June 30 of each year, beginning with December 31, 2018, of at least 1.2 to 1.0. Under current commodities pricing, we expect that we will be in compliance with all financial covenants through 2016. Further deterioration in commodities pricing, however, could result in non-compliance and cause us to seek to negotiate revisions to our loan covenants, which relief may not be obtainable from our bank lenders.\nThe failure to comply with these covenants will constitute an event of default (subject, in the case of certain covenants, to applicable notice and/or cure periods) under the term loan credit facility. Other events of default under the term loan credit facility include, among other things, (1) the failure to timely pay principal, interest, fees or other amounts due and owing, (2) the inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, (3) the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events, and (4) the loss of lien perfection or priority. The occurrence and continuance of an event of default could result in, among other things, acceleration of all amounts outstanding.\nSenior Notes\nIn March 2011, we issued $300 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes. The 2019 Senior Notes, which are unsecured, were issued at par and bear interest at 7.75% per year, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. In April 2011, we issued an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes with an original issue discount of 1% or $0.5 million. In October 2013, we issued an additional $250 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes at par to yield 7.75% to maturity. All of the 2019 Senior Notes are treated as a single class of debt securities under the same indenture. We may redeem some or all of the 2019 Senior Notes at redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) equal to 101.938% beginning on April 1, 2016 and 100% beginning on April 1, 2017 or for any period thereafter, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe Indenture contains covenants that restrict our ability to: (1) borrow money; (2) issue redeemable or preferred stock; (3) pay distributions or dividends; (4) make investments; (5) create liens without securing the 2019 Senior Notes; (6) enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries; (7) sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies; (8) enter into transactions with affiliates; (9) guarantee indebtedness; and (10) enter into new lines of business. One such covenant provides that, with certain exceptions, we may incur indebtedness if the ratio of consolidated EBITDAX to consolidated interest expense (as these terms are defined in the Indenture) exceeds 2.25 times. While we met this ratio as of December 31, 2015, if we do not meet this ratio in the future, in order to borrow under our revolving credit facility or make other borrowings, we expect to rely primarily on a covenant provision permitting the incurrence of indebtedness under a Credit Facility (as defined in the Indenture) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the greater of (a) $500 million and (b) 30% of Adjusted Consolidated Net Tangible Assets (as defined in the Indenture). These covenants are subject to a number of additional important exceptions and qualifications as described in the Indenture. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nAsset Sales\nFrom time to time, we sell certain of our proved and unproved properties when we believe it is more advantageous to dispose of the selected properties than to continue to hold them. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we received cash proceeds aggregating $71.5 million from various asset sales including the sale under a three-year term assignment in December 2015 of certain acreage in Burleson County, Texas for $21.8 million, the sale in June 2015 pursuant to a term assignment of certain acreage in Burleson County, Texas for $22.1 million and a sale in September 2015 of our interests in selected leases and wells in South Louisiana for $11.8 million. We are actively considering other selected sales as a source of additional funds to supplement cash flow from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan credit facility to meet our capital needs.\nAlternative capital resources\nWe believe we currently have adequate liquidity to enable us to fund our expected capital expenditures for 2016 through a combination of (1) cash on hand made available by the Refinancing, (2) cash flow from operations, and (3) borrowings under the revolving credit facility.\nSubject to any restrictions in the revolving credit facility and the term loan credit facility, we may also use other capital resources, including (1) entering into joint venture participation agreements with other industry or financial partners in our core development areas, (2) monetizing all or a portion of our core or non-core assets and (3) issuing additional debt or equity securities in private or public offerings, in order to finance a portion of our capital spending in fiscal 2016 and subsequent periods. While we believe we would be able to obtain funds through one or more of these alternative capital resources, if needed, there can be no assurance that these capital resources would be available on terms acceptable to us.\nContractual obligations and contingent commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 by payment due date.\n\n (a) In addition to the principal payments presented, we expect to make annual interest payments of $47.1 million on the 2019 Senior Notes. \n (b) Amount includes lease payments for two drilling rigs. \n (c) Following the Refinancing, our pro forma indebtedness at December 31, 2015 was approximately $933 million, consisting of $333.2 million, net of $16.8 million original issue discount, under the term loan credit agreement and $599.8 million in outstanding principal amount of the 2019 Senior Notes, net of unamortized discount. In addition to the principal payments presented, we expect to pay interest on the term loans in cash at 12.5% per year or, at our option, subject to certain restrictions, in kind at 15% per year. \nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nCurrently, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nOperating Margins\nWe analyze, on a BOE produced basis, those revenues and expenses that have a significant impact on our oil and gas operating margins. Our weighted average oil and gas sales per BOE have declined from $76.11 per BOE in 2013, to $72.59 per BOE in 2014 and $37.67 per BOE in 2015. Our oil and gas depletion per BOE fluctuated from $26.13 per BOE in 2013, to $24.73 per BOE in 2014 and $25.54 per BOE in 2015. Our production costs per BOE have decreased from $20.63 per BOE in 2013, to $18.27 per BOE in 2014 and $15.17 per BOE in 2015. The decrease in operating costs per BOE in 2015 from 2013 was due primarily to lower costs of field services, decreased production taxes resulting from lower commodity prices in 2015 and a reduction in production costs associated with the sale of non-core assets.\nOil and Gas Production\nAs with all companies engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, we face the challenge of natural production decline because oil and gas reserves are a depletable resource. With each unit of oil and gas we produce, we are depleting our proved reserve base, so we must be able to conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties with proved reserves in order to grow our reserve base. Our production in 2015 remained unchanged at 5.8 MMBOE compared to 2014, and we replaced 61% of our 2015 oil and gas production through extensions and discoveries. While these 2015 reserve additions will contribute favorably to our production in 2016, we do not expect this production to be sufficient to fully offset the natural production declines from our existing base of oil and gas reserves.\nWe currently plan to decrease capital spending during 2016 to $65.7 million on exploration and development activities compared to $124.5 million in 2015. Failure to maintain or grow our oil and gas reserves may result in lower production and may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nImpact of Downturn in Oil Prices\nOur business is subject to various trends and uncertainties, the most significant of which are related to commodity prices. The severe downturn in oil prices that began late in 2014 significantly reduced our cash flow from operations, causing us to suspend drilling operations in both of our core resource plays early in 2015 in order to preserve liquidity. Management quickly took decisive steps to reduce costs in an attempt to improve margins, but the combination of declining production attributable to suspended drilling activities and the impact of substantially lower oil and natural gas prices on cash flow will continue to have an adverse effect on our business if the downturn is prolonged.\nFurther significant and prolonged declines in prices could impact our ability to service our debt obligations and will further constrain our ability to use cash flows to drill to replace or increase our production and reserves.\nTo mitigate the impact of further deterioration in prices, we entered into swaps covering 1,597 MBbls of our oil production for the period from January 2016 through June 2017 at prices ranging from $40.25 to $44.30 per barrel. In addition, we granted an option on an additional 739 MBbls of oil production from July 2016 through December 2016 at $40.25 per barrel exercisable by the counterparty by June 30, 2016.\nLow commodity prices also have an adverse impact on our oil and gas reserves. In our evaluation of year-end 2015 reserves, management took into account its outlook for future oil and natural gas prices and the availability of financial resources, including the Refinancing in March 2016, to assess the future development plan for our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015. Considering the potential for an extended low product price environment, we did not schedule any proved undeveloped locations for drilling in 2016 or 2017. Based on our current long-term outlook for improved commodity prices and our reasonable expectations for access to adequate financing required to fund future drilling, we scheduled for 2018 through 2020 aggregate future capital spending for proved undeveloped locations of $135.7 million with associated reserves of 10,196 MBOE for year-end 2015. Substantially all of these proved undeveloped locations are located in our core Delaware Basin play in Reeves County, Texas. An additional $0.8 million of estimated future capital spending and 93 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves is attributable to our general partner interest in an affiliated partnership, which is proportionately consolidated in our financial statements. This assessment also resulted in the downgrade of 9,561 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to probable reserves at year-end 2015. If commodity prices do not improve to levels sufficient to support future drilling, future assessments could result in a reduction in development capital expenditures and additional downgrades of proved undeveloped reserves.\nThe prolonged effects of lower oil prices, declining production and lower proved reserves may have an adverse effect on our ability to access the capital resources we need to grow our reserve base. If we continue limited drilling activities for a significant period of time, or if our future access to capital resources is limited, we will also likely further delay our development of our proved undeveloped reserves or ultimately suspend such development, which could result in further reductions in undeveloped reserves.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSummary\nIn this section, we will identify the critical accounting policies we follow in preparing our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. Many of these policies require us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments in the course of making estimates of matters that are inherently imprecise. We explain the nature of these estimates, assumptions and judgments, and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported in our consolidated financial statements under different conditions or using different assumptions.\nThe following table lists our critical accounting policies, the estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the application of these accounting policies and the financial statement accounts affected by these estimates and assumptions.\n\nSignificant Estimates and Assumptions\nOil and gas reserves\nReserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of a reserve estimate depends on the quality of available geological and engineering data, the precision of and the interpretation of that data and judgment based on experience and training. Annually, we engage independent petroleum engineering firms to evaluate our oil and gas reserves. As a part of this process, our internal reservoir engineer and the independent petroleum engineers exchange information and attempt to reconcile any material differences in estimates and assumptions.\nThe techniques used in estimating reserves usually depend on the nature and extent of available data, and the accuracy of the estimates may vary accordingly. As a general rule, the degree of accuracy of reserve estimates varies with the reserve classification and the related accumulation of available data, as shown in the following table.\n\nAssumptions as to future commodity prices and operating and capital costs also play a significant role in estimating oil and gas reserves and the estimated present value of the cash flows to be received from the future production of those reserves. Volumes of recoverable reserves are affected by the assumed prices and costs due to what is known as the economic limit (that point in the future when the projected costs and expenses of producing recoverable reserves exceed the projected revenues from the reserves). But more significantly, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is extremely sensitive to prices and costs, and may vary materially based on different assumptions. Current SEC financial accounting and reporting standards require that pricing parameters be the arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the 12-month period preceding the effective date of the reserve report. Varying pricing can result in significant changes in reserves and standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from period to period, as illustrated in the following table.\n\nValuation of unproved properties\nEstimating fair market value of unproved properties (also known as prospects) is very subjective since there is no quoted market for undeveloped exploratory prospects. The negotiated price of any prospect between a willing seller and willing buyer depends on the specific facts regarding the prospect, including:\n \u2022 the location of the prospect in relation to known fields and reservoirs, available markets and transportation systems for oil and gas production in the vicinity and other critical services; \n \u2022 the nature and extent of geological and geophysical data on the prospect; \n \u2022 the terms of the leases holding the acreage in the prospect, such as ownership interests, expiration terms, royalty interests, delay rental obligations, depth limitations, drilling and marketing restrictions, continuous development obligations, and similar terms; \n \u2022 the prospect's risk-adjusted potential for return on investment, giving effect to such factors as potential reserves to be discovered, drilling and completion costs, prevailing commodity prices and other economic factors; and \n \u2022 the results of drilling activity in close proximity to the prospect that could either enhance or condemn the prospect's chances of success. \nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe estimate the present value of the amount we will incur to plug, abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives, in accordance with applicable state laws. We compute our liability for asset retirement obligations\nby calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows related to each property. This requires us to use significant assumptions, including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs, annual inflation of these costs, the productive lives of wells and our risk-adjusted interest rate. Changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligations.\nEffects of Estimates and Assumptions on Financial Statements\nGAAP does not require, or even permit, the restatement of previously issued financial statements due to changes in estimates unless such estimates were unreasonable or did not comply with applicable SEC accounting rules. We are required to use our best judgment in making estimates and assumptions, taking into consideration the best and most current data available to us at the time of the estimate. At each accounting period, we make a new estimate using new data, and continue the cycle. You should be aware that estimates prepared at various times may be substantially different due to new or additional data. While an estimate made at one point in time may differ from an estimate made at a later date, both may be proper due to the differences in available data or assumptions. In this section, we will discuss the effects of different estimates on our consolidated financial statements.\nProvision for DD&A\nWe compute our provision for DD&A on a unit-of-production method. Each quarter, we use the following formulas to compute the provision for DD&A for each of our producing properties (or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities):\n \u2022 DD&A Rate = Unamortized Cost / Beginning of Period Reserves \n \u2022 Provision for DD&A = DD&A Rate x Current Period Production \nReserve estimates have a significant impact on the DD&A rate. If reserve estimates for a property or group of properties are revised downward in future periods, the DD&A rate for that property or group of properties will increase as a result of the revision. Alternatively, if reserve estimates are revised upward, the DD&A rate will decrease.\nImpairment of Unproved Properties\nEach quarter, we review our unproved oil and gas properties to determine if there has been, in our judgment, an impairment in value of each prospect that we consider individually significant. To the extent that the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated value, we make a provision for impairment of unproved properties and record the provision as abandonments and impairments within exploration costs on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). If the value is revised upward in a future period, we do not reverse the prior provision, and we continue to carry the prospect at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value. If the value is revised downward in a future period, an additional provision for impairment is made in that period.\nImpairment of Proved Properties and Long-Lived Assets\nEach quarter, we assess our producing properties for impairment. If we determine there has been an impairment in any of our producing properties (or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities), we will estimate the value of each affected property. In accordance with GAAP, the value for this purpose is a fair value using Level 3 inputs instead of a standardized reserve value as prescribed by the SEC. We attempt to value each property using reserve classifications and pricing parameters similar to what a willing seller and willing buyer might use. These parameters may include escalations of prices instead of constant pricing, and they may also include the risk-adjusted value of reserves. To the extent that the carrying cost for the affected property exceeds its estimated fair value, we make a provision for impairment of proved properties. If the fair value is revised upward in a future period, we do not reverse the prior provision, and we continue to carry the property at a net cost that is lower than its estimated fair value. If the fair value is revised downward in a future period, an additional provision for impairment is made in that period. Accordingly, the carrying costs of producing properties on our balance sheet will vary from (and often will be less than) the present value of proved reserves for these properties.\nJudgment Regarding Status of In-Progress Wells\nOn a quarterly basis, we review the status of each in-progress well to determine the proper accounting treatment under the successful efforts method of accounting. Cumulative costs on in-progress wells remain capitalized until their productive status becomes known. If an in-progress exploratory well is found to be unsuccessful (often referred to as a dry hole) prior to the issuance of our consolidated financial statements, we write-off all costs incurred through the balance sheet date to abandonments and\nimpairments expense, a component of exploration costs. Costs incurred on that dry hole after the balance sheet date are charged to exploration costs in the period incurred.\nOccasionally, we are unable to make a final determination about the productive status of a well prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements. In these cases, we leave the well classified as in-progress until we have had sufficient time to conduct additional completion or testing operations and to evaluate the pertinent geological and geophysical and engineering data obtained. At the time when we are able to make a final determination of a well's productive status, the well is removed from the in-progress status and the proper accounting treatment is recorded.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOur asset retirement obligations are recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset's inception, with an offsetting increase to oil and gas properties. Periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). During 2015, we had an upward revision of our estimated asset retirement obligations of $3.1 million based on a review of current plugging and abandonment costs. Revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to producing properties, resulting in prospective changes to DD&A expense and accretion expense. Because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells, the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).\u201d The main difference between the current requirement under GAAP and ASU 2016-02 is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease). The liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments. The asset will be based on the liability, subject to adjustment, such as for initial direct costs. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Operating leases will result in straight-line expense (similar to current operating leases) while finance leases will result in a front-loaded expense pattern (similar to current capital leases). Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-02 must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition, and provides for certain practical expedients. Transaction will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. We are evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes.\u201d This ASU requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The standard will be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption will be permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. This standard may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities or retrospectively to all periods presented. Adoption of the new guidance will affect the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.\u201d This ASU requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied prospectively, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d that requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. An entity is required to apply ASU 2015-03 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. An entity should apply ASU 2015-03 on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. Upon transition, an entity is required to comply with the applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting principle. These disclosures include the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle, the transition method, a description of the prior-period information that has\nbeen retrospectively adjusted, and the effect of the change on the financial statement line items (that is, debt issuance cost asset and the debt liability). We currently present debt issuance costs on the balance sheet as an asset. As of December 31, 2015, we had $9.6 million of debt issuance costs, which under this standard would be reclassified from an asset to a direct deduction to the related debt liability.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\u201d that outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date\u201d, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. That new standard is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. An entity can apply ASU 2014-09 using either a full retrospective method, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or a modified retrospective method, meaning the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard is recognized in the most current period presented in the financial statements. We are evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes.\n\nOverview:\nThe company primarily drills developmental oil wells in the Permian Basin and the Giddings Area and has significant drilling opportunities. In 2015, they spent $50.5 million in the Wolfbone area, with plans to spend $53 million in 2016. Drilling and leasing activities in the Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford Shale region cost them $50.9 million in 2015, with a plan to spend $10.7 million in 2016.\n\nThe oil price downturn starting in 2014 significantly reduced cash flow, leading to the suspension of drilling operations to preserve liquidity. Management took steps to cut costs and entered into swap agreements to mitigate the impact of further price declines. Low prices also affected oil and gas reserve valuations and their ability to service debt obligations and fund drilling. Significant price declines could impact future drilling and reserve downgrades.\n \nKey Factors to Consider:\n- The ongoing drop in commodity prices reduced sales and led to limited drilling activities.\n- Sales decreased by 48% in 2015 due to price and production variances.\n- Production costs decreased by 17% from 2014 to 2015 due to lower taxes and costs.\n- The company recorded a gain on derivatives and incurred asset impairments due to lower commodity prices.\n- Exploration expenses related to abandonment and impairment dropped significantly from 2014 to 2015.\n- G&A expenses decreased mainly due to salary and personnel reductions.\n- Proved oil and gas reserves decreased 38% at the end of 2015, with only 61% of production replaced through extensions and discoveries.\n\nOil and Gas Reserves:\n- There were additions in proved reserves due to Delaware Basin drilling, with certain reserves reclassified due to SEC rules.\n- Decreases in reserves were largely due to lower commodity prices affecting estimates.\n\nSupplemental Information:\nTables detail oil and gas production data, average realized prices, gains or losses on settled derivative contracts, and daily production by the area. Additional tables summarize total proved reserves and exploration costs.\n\nOperating Results (2015 Compared to 2014):\n- A significant decrease in oil and gas operating results.\n- Lower commodity prices leading to impairment of properties.\n- A gain on derivatives, despite the volatility of mark-to-market valuations.\n- A net loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory in 2015 compared to a net gain in 2014.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources:\n- The severe downturn in oil prices has led to a consideration of strategic alternatives to improve liquidity, including the Refinancing process in March 2016, resulting in term loans of $333.2 million and additional cash.\n- Capital expenditure for 2016 is planned at $65.7 million, compared to $124.5 million spent in 2015, due to reduced activity.\n\nThe report then outlines various critical accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements that may influence future financial statements. Additionally, the company is facing risks from oil price volatility, which could significantly impact its ability to generate cash flow and service debt."}
