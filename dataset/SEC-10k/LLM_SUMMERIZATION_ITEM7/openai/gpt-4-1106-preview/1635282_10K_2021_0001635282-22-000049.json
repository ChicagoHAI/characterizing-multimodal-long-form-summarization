Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRimini Street, Inc. (referred to as the Company\u201d, we\u201d and us\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware on October 10, 2017. As discussed below, the Company's predecessor was also named Rimini Street, Inc., a company incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 2005 and referred to herein as RSI. References to management\u201d or management team\u201d refer to the officers and directors of the Company and/or RSI as its predecessor.\nRimini Street, Inc. ( RSI\u201d) was incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 2005. RSI provides enterprise software support services. In May 2017, RSI entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with GP Investments Acquisition Corp. ( GPIA\u201d), a publicly-held special purpose acquisition company ( SPAC\u201d) incorporated in the Cayman Islands and formed for the purpose of effecting a business combination with one or more businesses. The Merger Agreement was approved by the respective shareholders of RSI and GPIA in October 2017, and closing occurred on October 10, 2017, resulting in (i) the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of GPIA with and into RSI, with RSI as the surviving corporation, after which (ii) RSI merged with and into GPIA, with GPIA as the surviving corporation and renamed Rimini\nStreet, Inc.\u201d (referred to herein as RMNI\u201d, as distinguished from RSI, which is defined as the predecessor entity with the same legal name) immediately after consummation of the second merger. As such, the consolidated financial results of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 presented in the consolidated financial statements reflect the operating results of RSI and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 can be found under Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" in our Annual Report on the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021, and is available on the SEC's website at sec.gov.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included in Item 8 of this Report. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A and elsewhere in this Report.\nCertain figures, such as interest rates and other percentages included in this section have been rounded for ease of presentation. Percentage figures included in this section have not in all cases been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in our consolidated financial statements or in the associated text. Certain other amounts that appear in this section may similarly not sum due to rounding.\nOverview\nRimini Street, Inc. and its subsidiaries (together, the Company or we\u201d) is a global provider of enterprise software support products and services, and the leading independent software support provider for Oracle and SAP products, based on both the number of active clients supported and recognition by industry analyst firms. We founded our company to disrupt and redefine the enterprise software support market by developing and delivering innovative new products and services that fill a then unmet need in the market. We believe we have achieved and sustained our leadership position in independent enterprise software support by delivering on our mission to provide extraordinary technology solutions that achieve each client's strategic, operational, and financial goals.\nEnterprise software support products and services is one of the largest categories of overall global information technology ( IT\u201d) spending. We believe core enterprise resource planning ( ERP\u201d), customer relationship management ( CRM\u201d), product lifecycle management ( PLM\u201d) and technology software platforms have become increasingly important in the operation of mission-critical business processes over the last 30 years, and also that the costs associated with failure, downtime, security exposure and maintaining the tax, legal and regulatory compliance of these core software systems have also increased. As a result, we believe that licensees often view software support as a mandatory cost of doing business, resulting in recurring and highly profitable revenue streams for enterprise software vendors. For example, for fiscal year 2021, SAP reported that support revenue represented approximately 41% of its total revenue and, for fiscal 2021, Oracle reported a margin of 85% for cloud services and license support.\nWe believe that software vendor support is an increasingly costly model that has not evolved to offer licensees the responsiveness, quality, breadth of capabilities or value needed to meet the needs of licensees. Organizations are under increasing pressure to reduce their IT costs while also delivering improved business performance through the adoption and integration of emerging technologies, such as mobile, virtualization, internet of things ( IoT\u201d) and cloud computing. Today, however, the majority of IT budget is spent operating and maintaining existing infrastructure and systems. As a result, we believe organizations are increasingly seeking ways to redirect budgets from maintenance to new technology investments that provide greater strategic value, and our software products and services help clients achieve these objectives by reducing the total cost of support.\nWe believe that AMS for enterprise software is a large market with significant unmet needs in client satisfaction and value. Traditional AMS providers compete on price, but the traditional AMS model is broken with a focus a land and expand\u201d model based on initial cheaper, less-skilled workers but higher costs over time and frequently poor client satisfaction or degradation in service over time. Providers usually contract for lower-cost services with a goal to grow revenue through scope creep by adding hours to open tickets or selling new project work. These lower-cost AMS support models sound cost-effective,\nbut their contractual structures can both enable and incent traditional AMS providers to maximize their own revenue at the expense of their clients by addressing\u201d issues (sometimes neither quickly nor efficiently), but not necessarily resolving them or their root causes. In addition, traditional AMS offerings are disparate and separate from software vendor support, with inherent inefficiencies and gaps that further limit responsiveness, root cause analysis and business value.\nWe believe organizations are realizing the value of an integrated, expert-led Support and AMS offering that eliminates inefficiencies, realizes joint value from the resolution of root causes that reduce issue volumes over time, and improves client satisfaction. Through our solution offerings, Rimini Street provides expert, ultra-responsive support and AMS, functioning as an extension of IT teams, with engineers available 24x7x365 around the globe for all AMS and enterprise software projects, and to fill skill gaps or help with rightsizing enterprise teams. Rimini Street teams deliver a wide variety of desired outcomes for a broad range of use cases such as supporting entire enterprise software systems, reducing costs, clearing backlogs, or facilitating the redeployment of IT teams for more strategic initiatives.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we employed over 1,660 professionals and supported over 2,840 active clients globally, including 72 Fortune 500 companies and 16 Fortune Global 100 companies across a broad range of industries. We define an active client as a distinct entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a business unit of a company that purchases our services to support a specific product. For example, we count as two separate active client instances in circumstances where we provide support for two different products to the same entity. We market and sell our services globally, primarily through our direct sales force, and have wholly-owned subsidiaries in Australia, Brazil, Canada, UAE (Dubai), France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. We believe our primary competitors are the enterprise software vendors whose products we service and support, including IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP.\nOur subscription-based revenue provides a strong foundation for, and visibility into, future period results. We generated revenue of $374.4 million, $326.8 million and $281.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021. 2020, and 2019, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of 15% and 16% for 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have a history of losses, and as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $225.8 million. We earned net income of $75.2 million, $11.6 million and $21.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We generated approximately 53% of our revenue in the United States and approximately 47% of our revenue from our international business for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations through cash collected from clients and net proceeds from equity financings and borrowings.\nWe intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We have invested and expect to continue investing in expanding our ability to market, sell and provide our current and future products and services to clients globally. We also expect to continue investing in the development and improvement of new and existing products and services to address client needs. We currently do not expect to be profitable in the near future.\nImpact of COVID-19\nNear the end of the first quarter of 2020, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic took hold and had widespread, rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets and business practices. These rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts continue as virus variants have resulted in additional outbreaks to date. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal and state governments have implemented multiple measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, quarantine guidance following travel to certain jurisdictions, limitations on public gatherings and continued closures of certain non-essential businesses, vaccination mandates or requirements for businesses to confirm employees' vaccination status, and other restrictions. As a result, to protect the health and well-being of our employees, clients and the communities in which we operate, we transitioned as many of our employees as possible to a work-at-home model, temporarily closed our offices worldwide, placed restrictions on non-essential business travel, transitioned to a no in-person event marketing strategy and implemented a fully remote sales model. We believe these measures have been successful and have not significantly affected our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have implemented business continuity measures and will continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic as circumstances dictate.\nAs a result of the measures that we have taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic described above, we have realized reduced costs of travel, reductions in costs resulting from cancelling certain in-person marketing events, reductions in office operating costs and potential rent abatement related to office closures around the world. While some of our offices have\npartially re-opened with limited staffing, our offices will not fully re-open until local authorities permit us to, and our own criteria and conditions to ensure employee health and safety are satisfied. We continue to expect to offset some of these reduced costs with accelerated investments including implementing virtual sales and other marketing programs, special compensation bonuses for lower-paid employees and special compensation bonuses for employees who have tested positive for COVID-19. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we paid COVID-19 special bonuses to certain of our employees to help with pandemic-related special costs and for the few of our employees who have tested positive for COVID-19. We have authorized COVID-19 special bonuses during pandemic that have been paid throughout 2020 and 2021. The cost of these special bonuses were more than offset by the cost reductions relating to travel and in-person marketing event fees and expenses described above.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had no significant net impact on our revenue or results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2021, and we continued to deliver uninterrupted and critical support services to our clients during this period. Our ability to utilize our secure remote-connectivity global infrastructure promotes the safety of our employees while abiding by the restrictions currently in place where they are located throughout the world. While we did implement discounted or extended payment terms for certain of our clients in 2020, in most cases it was in exchange for contractual concessions favorable to us, for example, extended contract terms or marketing support for references, and the collective impact of such changes was not material to our results. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted business markets worldwide, primarily due to the uncertainty relating to the continued effects of the pandemic. As a result, we have experienced some clients not renewing our services as their businesses have been adversely impacted during the pandemic. Despite this, we expect to continue to be able to market, sell and provide our current and future products and services to clients globally. We also expect to continue investing in the development and improvement of new and existing products and services to address client needs.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental and business actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as our clients' ability to pay for our services on an ongoing basis. This uncertainty also affects management's accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including receivables and forward-looking guidance. As such, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our financial results until future periods. Refer to Risk Factors\u201d (Part I, Item 1A of this Report) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) was signed into law in the United States to address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We elected to defer payroll tax payments which totaled $1.6 million as of December 31, 2021 as permitted by the CARES Act (such deferred payroll taxes are due in two installments: 50% by December 31, 2021 and 50% by December 31, 2022). We paid $1.6 million in December 2021 as required under the CARES Act. We continue to monitor any effects that may result from the CARES Act and other similar legislation or actions in geographies in which our business operates.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 27, 2022, our Board approved adoption of a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $15.0 million of our common stock both on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans, through March 4, 2024, subject to compliance with our Credit Agreement dated July 2, 2021, and amended January 14, 2022 to increase the amount of securities that could be purchased by us to approximately $15.0 million during the term of the facility, and other applicable legal requirements.\nOn July 20, 2021, we redeemed the remaining 87,802 shares of our 13.00% Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate total redemption price of $88.4 million. The total redemption price consisted of $87.8 million related to the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a face value of $1,000 per share and $0.6 million or $6.86 per share of Series A Preferred Stock related to the dividends earned for the period from July 1, 2021 through July 19, 2021. The redeemed shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, along with the dividends, were recorded on the redemption date of July 20, 2021.\nWe funded the July 20, 2021 redemption with borrowings from a five year secured term loan of $90 million, which was entered into on July 20, 2021 (the Credit Facility\u201d). Annual minimum principal payments over the five year term for the Credit Facility will be 5%, 5%, 7.5%, 7.5% and 10%, respectively, with the remaining balance due at the end of the term. See Note 5 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further information regarding our Credit Facility.\nOn April 16, 2021, we redeemed 60,000 shares of our 13.00% Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate total redemption price of $62.3 million. The total price consists of $60.0 million related to the face value of $1,000 per share of Series A Preferred Stock and $2.3 million or $39.05 per share of Series A Preferred Stock related to the dividends to be earned for the period from April 1, 2021 through July 18, 2021. The redeemed shares of Series A Preferred Stock, along with the dividends to be earned, were recorded when the Series A Preferred Stock became mandatorily redeemable on April 16, 2021.\nAdditionally, reference is made to Notes 5 and 6 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for a discussion of developments related to our Series A Preferred Stock and Credit Facility.\nOn March 11, 2021, we completed the March 2021 Offering of 7.8 million shares of our Common Stock at a price of $7.75 per share for total gross proceeds of $57.0 million. Underwriter discounts and commissions were $2.9 million and the underwriter expenses were $0.2 million. We also incurred additional professional fees and expenses of $1.3 million as part of the transaction, resulting in net proceeds from the March 2021 Offering of approximately $55.6 million. We used the net proceeds from the March 2021 Offering to redeem 60,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Reference is made to Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for information about the March 2021 Offering.\nAlso, reference is made to Note 10 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for a discussion of developments in our litigation with Oracle.\nOur Business Model\nWe believe most enterprise software vendors license the rights for customers to use their software. In a traditional licensing model, the customer typically procures a perpetual software license and pays for the license in a single upfront fee ( Perpetual License\u201d), and base software support services can be optionally procured from the software vendor for an annual fee that are typically 20-23% of the total cost of the software license. In a subscription-based licensing model, such as software as a service, or SaaS, the customer generally pays as it goes for usage of the software on a monthly or annual basis ( Subscription License\u201d). Under a Subscription License, the product license and a base level of software support are generally bundled together as a single purchase, and the base level of software support is not procured separately nor is it an optional purchase.\nWhen we provide base software support for a Perpetual License, we generally offer our clients service for a fee that is equal to approximately 50% of the annual fees charged by the software vendor for their base support. When providing supplemental software support for a Perpetual License, where the client procures our support service in addition to retaining the software vendor's base support, we generally offer our clients service for a fee that is equal to 25% of the annual fees charged by the software vendor for their base support. For supplemental software support on a Subscription License, we generally offer our clients services for a fee that is equal to 50% of the annual fees charged by the software vendor for their supplemental or premium support. We also offer a special support service, Rimini Street Extra Secure Support, for clients that require a higher level of security clearance for our engineers accessing their system. Rimini Street Extra Secure Support is an additional fee added to our base or supplemental support fee. Subscriptions for additional software products and services are available, designed to meet specific client needs and we believe provide exceptional value for the fees charged.\nOur subscription-based software support products and services offer enterprise software licensees a choice of solutions that replace or supplement the support products and services offered by enterprise software vendors for their products. Features, service levels, service breadth, technology and pricing differentiate our software products and services. We believe clients utilize our software products and services to achieve substantial cost savings; receive more responsive and comprehensive support; obtain support for their customized software that is not generally covered under the enterprise software vendor's service offerings; enhance their software functionality, capabilities, and data usage; and protect their systems and extend the life of their existing software releases and products. Our products and services enable our clients to keep their mission-critical systems operating smoothly and to remain in tax, legal and regulatory compliance; improve productivity; and better allocate limited budgets, labor and other resources to investments that provide competitive advantage and support growth.\nWe currently offer most of our support products and services on a subscription basis for a term that is generally 15 years in length with generally an initial, non-cancelable period of two to three years. The negotiated fees extend for the full term of the contract and usually include modest increases (averaging approximately three percent) after the initial non-cancelable period of each contract. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 80% of our invoicing was generated inside a non-cancelable period, and approximately 20% of our invoicing was generated outside of a non-cancelable period.\nAfter a non-cancelable period, our clients generally have the ability to terminate their support contracts on an annual basis upon a notice period generally ranging from 60 to 90 days prior to the end of the support period or renegotiate a mutually-agreeable, additional support period - including potentially an additional multi-year, non-cancelable support period. We generally invoice our clients annually in advance of the support period. We record amounts invoiced for support periods that have not yet occurred as deferred revenue on our balance sheet. We net any unpaid accounts receivable amounts relating to cancellable support periods against deferred revenue on our balance sheet.\nIn November 2019, we announced the global availability of our Application Management Systems (\"AMS\") for Oracle, which includes coverage for Oracle Database, Middleware and a wide range of Oracle applications including E-Business Suite, JD Edwards, PeopleSoft and Siebel. In addition to leveraging our support services for Oracle that replaces expensive and less robust software vendor annual support with a more responsive and comprehensive support offering, our clients can now have us manage their Oracle systems day-to-day with an integrated application management and support service provided by a single trusted vendor. As an integrated service, we believe we can provide clients a better model, better people, and better outcomes with higher satisfaction and significant savings of time, labor and money. The AMS for Oracle includes system administration, operational support, health monitoring and enhancement support.\nIn August 2019, we announced plans to globally offer AMS for SAP enterprise software, expanding the scope of support services we offer clients globally. This AMS service is in addition to our traditional enterprise Support Services. We are already providing this new SAP AMS service to clients in North and South America. The service includes system administration and SAP Basis support, system health monitoring with proactive analysis, preventative system recommendations and event detection; and enhancement support for complex SAP software landscapes.\nOur pricing model is a key component of our marketing and sales strategy and we believe delivers significant savings and value to our clients.\nKey Business Metrics\nNumber of clients\nSince we founded our company, we have made the expansion of our client base a priority. We believe that our ability to expand our client base is an indicator of the growth of our business, the success of our sales and marketing activities, and the value that our services bring to our clients. We define an active client as a distinct entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a business unit of a company that purchases our services to support a specific product. For example, we count as two separate active clients when support for two different products is being provided to the same entity. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had over 2,840, 2,480 and 2,060 active clients, respectively.\nWe define a unique client as a distinct entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution or a subsidiary, division or business unit of a company that purchases one or more of our products or services. We count as two separate unique clients when two separate subsidiaries, divisions or business units of an entity purchase our products or services. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had over 1,470, 1,310 and 1,160 unique clients, respectively.\nThe increase in both our active and unique client counts have been almost exclusively from new unique clients and not from sales of new products and services to existing unique clients. However, as noted previously, we intend to focus future growth on both new and existing clients. We believe that the growth in our number of clients is an indication of the increased adoption of our enterprise software products and services.\nAnnualized subscription revenue\nWe recognize subscription revenue on a daily basis. We define annualized subscription revenue as the amount of subscription revenue recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. This gives us an indication of the revenue that can be earned in the following 12-month period from our existing client base assuming no cancellations or price changes occur during that period. Subscription revenue excludes any non-recurring revenue, which has been insignificant to date. Our annualized subscription revenue was approximately $393 million, $349 million and $302 million as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenue retention rate\nA key part of our business model is the recurring nature of our revenue. As a result, it is important that we retain clients after the completion of the non-cancelable portion of the support period. We believe that our revenue retention rate provides insight into the quality of our products and services and the value that our products and services provide our clients.\nWe define revenue retention rate as the actual subscription revenue (dollar-based) recognized in a 12-month period from clients that existed on the day prior to the start of the 12-month period divided by our annualized subscription revenue as of the day prior to the start of the 12-month period. Our revenue retention rate was 92% for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nGross margin\nWe derive revenue through the sale of our enterprise software products and services. All the costs incurred in providing these products and services are recognized as part of the cost of revenue. The cost of revenue includes all direct product line expenses, as well as the expenses incurred by our shared services organization which supports all product lines.\nWe define gross profit as the difference between revenue and the costs incurred in providing the software products and services. Gross margin is the ratio of gross profit divided by revenue. Our gross margin was approximately 63.6%, 61.4% and 62.6% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe the gross margin provides an indication of how efficiently and effectively we are operating our business and serving our clients.\nFactors Affecting Our Operating Performance\nLitigation\nThe information from Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Item 1A, Risk Factors--Risks Related to Litigation- We and our Chief Executive Officer are involved in litigation with Oracle. An adverse outcome in the ongoing litigation could result in the payment of substantial damages and/or an injunction against certain of our business practices, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results,\u201d is incorporated by reference herein. For claims on which Oracle has prevailed or may prevail, we have been and could be required to pay substantial damages for our current or past business activities or be enjoined from certain business practices. Any of these outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdoption of enterprise software products and services\nWe believe the existing market for independent enterprise software support services is underserved. We currently provide support services for IBM, Microsoft, SAP, Oracle and other enterprise software vendors' products. We also believe the existing market for our other enterprise software products and services is underserved, and that we have unique products and services that can meet client needs in the marketplace. For example, we provide the Rimini Street Advanced Database Security product in partnership with McAfee, a global leader in cybersecurity.\nWe also believe that our total addressable market for our enterprise software products and services is substantially larger than our current client base and the products and services we currently offer. As a result, we believe we have the opportunity to expand our global client base and to further increase adoption of our software products and services within and across existing clients. However, as the market for independent enterprise software support services as well as our other software products and services is still emerging, it is difficult for us to predict the timing of when and if widespread acceptance will occur.\nSales cycle\nWe sell our services to our clients primarily through our direct sales organization. Our sales cycle, depending on the product or service, typically ranges from six months to a year from when a prospective client is engaged. While we believe that there is a significant market opportunity for our enterprise software products and services, we often must educate prospective clients about the value of our products and services, which can result in lengthy and multiple sales cycles, particularly for larger prospective clients, as well as the incurrence of significant marketing expenses. Our typical sales cycle with a prospective client begins with the generation of a sales lead through trade shows, industry events, online marketing, media interviews and articles, inbound calls, outbound calls or client, analyst or other referral. The sales lead is followed by an assessment of the prospect's current software license contract terms, systems environment, products and releases being used, needs and objectives.\nThe variability in our sales cycle for replacement or supplemental software support services is impacted by whether software vendors are able to convince potential clients that they should renew their software maintenance with the existing vendor or procure or renew supplemental support services from the existing vendor, respectively. Another driver of our sales cycle variability is any announcement by a software vendor of their discontinuation, reduction or limitation of support services for a particular software product or release for which we continue to offer a competing support service. In addition, our sales cycle variability is impacted by vendor discounts provided by software companies to retain existing clients or attract potential clients. Finally, our litigation with Oracle can also drive sales cycle variability as clients oftentimes perform their own legal due diligence, which can lengthen the sales cycle.\nKey Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations\nRevenue. We currently derive nearly all of our revenue from subscription-based contracts for software services. Revenue from these contracts is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the applicable service period.\nCost of revenue. Cost of revenue includes salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses associated with our technical support and services organization, as well as allocated overhead and non-personnel expenses such as outside services, professional fees and travel-related expenses. Allocated overhead includes overhead costs for depreciation of equipment, facilities (consisting of leasehold improvements and rent) and technical operations (including costs for compensation of our personnel and costs associated with our infrastructure). We recognize expenses related to our technical support and services organization as they are incurred.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our sales, marketing and business development employees and executives, amortization expense associated with capitalized sales commissions, sales commissions that do not qualify for capitalization, travel related expenses, outside services and allocated overhead. Sales commissions are costs of obtaining customer contracts and are capitalized and then amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be 4 years.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our administrative, legal, human resources, finance and accounting employees and executives. These expenses also include non-employee expenses, such as travel-related expenses, outside services, legal, auditing and other professional fees, and general corporate expenses, along with an allocation of our general overhead expenses.\nImpairment charges related to operating lease right-of-use assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment exists for property and equipment and other long-lived assets if the carrying amounts of such assets exceed the estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets. Impairment for intangible software assets is based upon an assessment of net realizable value. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset, or asset group, exceeds its fair value.\nLitigation costs and related recoveries, net. Litigation costs consist of legal settlements, pre-judgment interest, and third-party professional fees to defend against litigation claims. In the past, we have had liability insurance policies where a portion of our defense costs and litigation judgments or settlements have been reimbursed under the terms of the policies. Such insurance recoveries were reflected as a reduction of litigation costs upon notification of approval for reimbursement by the insurance company. For legal expenses related to Rimini II litigation, the deferred settlement liability was reduced with a corresponding reduction of legal expenses when the costs were incurred.\nInterest expense. Interest expense is incurred under our Credit Facility and other debt obligations. The components of interest expense include the amount of interest payable in cash at the stated interest rate, interest that is payable in kind through additional borrowings, make-whole applicable premium, and accretion of debt discounts and issuance costs ( DDIC\u201d) using the effective interest method.\nGain (loss) from change in fair value of redeemable warrants. We have revised certain prior period amounts on the audited condensed consolidated financial statements to correct a misstatement with respect to improperly classifying certain warrants to purchase approximately 6.1 million shares of our Common Stock, at $11.50 per share (the GP Sponsor Private Placement Warrants\u201d) as equity instead of as a warrant liability that is adjusted through charges or credits to the income statement each quarter to reflect changes in the fair value of the warrants, under the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 815-40, Contracts in Entity's Own Equity. The changes in the fair value of the GP Sponsor Private Placement Warrants are recorded each period through October 29, 2021.\nOther expenses, net. Other expenses, net consists primarily of gains or losses on foreign currency transactions, write-off of deferred debt financing costs related to unsuccessful financings, and interest income.\nIncome taxes. The provision for income taxes is based on the amount of our taxable income and enacted federal, state and foreign tax rates, as adjusted for allowable credits and deductions. Our provision for income taxes consists primarily of foreign taxes for the periods presented, as our taxable income for U.S. federal and state purposes is offset by net operating losses. In addition, based on all available evidence, we determined that it was more likely than not that we could benefit from our deferred tax assets, resulting in a tax benefit of $62.3 million in the current period. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In prior years, the domestic net deferred tax assets had been fully offset by a valuation allowance because of our lack of domestic earnings history.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years ended

In our consolidated financial statements, such costs are allocated between cost of revenue, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses based primarily on relative headcount, except for facilities which is based on occupancy.\nRevenue. Revenue increased from $326.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $374.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $47.7 million or 15%. The vast majority of this increase was driven by a 14% increase in the average number of unique clients, as opposed to existing unique clients subscribing to additional services. On a regional basis, United States revenue grew from $191.4 million for fiscal 2020 to $199.8 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $8.4 million or 4%, while international revenue grew from $135.3 million for fiscal 2020 to $174.6 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $39.3 million or 29%. Accelerated growth in our international business was driven by an increase in sales headcount primarily in Asia and Europe and an increase in marketing and advertising spend targeted for prospective clients outside the United States.\nCost of revenue. Total cost of revenue increased from $126.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $136.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $10.3 million or 8%. This increase was primarily due to additional support for the increasing number of clients that resulted in an increase in employee compensation and benefits of $11.1 million, an increase in all other costs of $1.4 million and an increase in allocated costs of $0.2 million. These cost increases were offset by a decrease in engineering consulting costs of $2.5 million.\nThe $11.1 million increase in cost of revenue attributable to employee compensation and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to (a) an increase in salaries, wages and benefit costs of $10.8 million due to a 16% increase in the average number of employees devoted to cost of revenue functions, annual pay increases, and increased bonus payouts. In addition, stock based compensation increased $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAs discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, in August 2018 Oracle obtained a permanent injunction from the District Court that prohibits us from using certain processes that could require us to incur additional labor costs to provide support for our clients as contracted. In September 2018, the Company filed a motion with the Court of Appeals, seeking a stay of the permanent injunction pending appeal and requesting a decision before the expiration of the temporary stay entered by the District Court. In November 2018, the Court of Appeals denied the Company's motion for a stay pending appeal of the injunction issued by the District Court without addressing the merits of the Company's appeal, and it confirmed the briefing schedule for the appeal. The briefing on our appeal to the Court of Appeals was completed in March 2019, and a hearing on our appeal occurred in July 2019. In August 2019, the Court of Appeals entered an order affirming the permanent injunction and the award of attorneys' fees that were previously paid to Oracle. However, the Court of Appeals agreed that the injunction was overbroad in two respects and instructed the District Court to remove the restriction on local hosting\u201d of J.D. Edwards and Siebel software and the prohibition against accessing\u201d J.D. Edwards and Siebel software source code. Since the date the temporary stay was lifted on the permanent injunction, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional expenses in the range of 1% to 2% of revenue for additional labor costs because, as drafted, the injunction contains language that could be read to cover some current support practices that are being litigated in the Rimini II\u201d lawsuit and that have not been found to be infringing.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased from $200.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $238.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $37.4 million or 19%. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 61.4% compared to 63.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $47.7 million or 15% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Total cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $10.3 million, or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Given that the increase in the cost of revenue was 8% compared to the increase in revenue of 15%, it resulted in a 220 basis points improvement in our gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the decline in engineering consulting costs and small increase in our allocated costs.\nSales and marketing expenses. As a percentage of our revenue, sales and marketing expenses have decreased from 35% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 34% for the year ended December 31, 2021. In dollar terms, sales and marketing expenses increased from $114.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $128.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $13.8 million or 12%. This increase was primarily due to (i) a $15.8 million increase in employee compensation and benefits as a result of a 16% increase in average headcount, (ii) an increase in trade show costs of $1.7 million, (iii) an increase in recruitment costs of $0.7 million and (iv) an increase of all other costs of $0.6 million. These increases were offset by declines in advertising, marketing and promotion costs and travel expenses of $2.0 million, $0.8 million and $2.3 million, respectively.\nThe $15.8 million increase in sales and marketing expense attributable to employee compensation and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to an increase in (i) salaries, wages and benefit costs of $12.6 million due to a 16% increase in the average number of employees devoted to sales and marketing functions, annual pay increases, and higher\nbonus payouts and (ii) commissions of $3.2 million due to new customer wins in excess of the prior year. Our overall spending increased as we attempt to accelerate our future revenue growth by investing in more resources.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased from $52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $64.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $12.0 million or 23%. This increase was primarily due to (i) increases in compensation and benefit costs of $10.3 million, (ii) an increase in computer software and license costs of $1.2 million, (iii) an increase of travel expenses of $0.9 million, (iv) an increase in other taxes of $0.4 million and (v) an increase in recruitment costs of $0.2 million. These unfavorable variances were offset, in part, by (i) a reduction of contract labor of $1.1 million, (ii) a favorable increase in administrative allocations of $0.6 million and (iii) a reduction in rent of $0.4 million.\nThe $10.3 million increase in general and administrative expenses attributable to employee compensation and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and benefit costs of $8.9 million due to a 12% increase in the average number of employees devoted to general and administrative functions, annual pay increases, and increased bonus payouts, and an increase of $1.4 million in stock-based compensation expense.\nWe expect to continue to incur higher expenses associated with supporting the growth of our business, both in terms of size and geographical diversity, and to meet the increased compliance requirements associated with being a public company. Public company costs that are expected to increase in the future include additional information systems costs, costs for additional personnel in our accounting, human resources, IT and legal functions, SEC and Nasdaq fees, and incremental professional, legal, audit and insurance costs. As a result, we currently expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in dollar terms in future periods.\nImpairment charges related to operating lease right-of-use assets. We recognized an impairment charge of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, related to two of our office leases as we ceased to use portions of our office space due to increased use of remote work which has occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLitigation costs and related recoveries, net. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, litigation costs and related recoveries, net consist of the following (in thousands): Table 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation settlement expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,530 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees and other defense costs of litigation </td> <td>16,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,964 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance recoveries, net </td> <td>(7,111) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,173) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation costs, net of related insurance recoveries </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,876 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,321 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLitigation settlement expense increased from no expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Following nearly two years of discovery by Oracle, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to five of the items. With respect to the other five items, the District Court found the Company violated the permanent injunction, awarded sanctions to Oracle of $0.6 million and ordered that certain computer files be quarantined from use and notice and proof of such quarantining be provided to Oracle. The District Court also ruled that Oracle may recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. The Company has estimated those costs to be $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nProfessional fees and other defense costs associated with litigation increased from $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $3.0 million. This increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with discovery work on the Rimini II litigation and the Rimini I appeal during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInsurance costs and related recoveries, net decreased from a net cost of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to net benefit of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized costs of $1.1 million to revise the amount due to the insurance company (for portions of the Court of Appeals and U.S. Supreme Court awards), which we paid in September 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we received insurance proceeds of $7.1 million related to our litigation costs incurred as part of the injunction proceedings. We are self-insured for any costs related to any current or future intellectual property litigation. We currently believe our cash on hand, accounts receivable and contractually committed backlog provides us with sufficient liquidity to cover costs related to our litigation with Oracle.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased from $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $1.5 million. Interest expense increased primarily due to entering into a five-year Credit Facility for $90 million on July 20, 2021.\nLoss on change in fair value of redeemable warrants. Loss on change in fair value of redeemable warrants amounted to a loss of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a loss of $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The fair value per warrant changed from $0.35 per warrant as of December 31, 2020 to $1.04 per warrant as of October 29, 2021, which was the date whereby the GP Sponsor Warrants were determined to no longer be treated as a liability. The fair value per warrant changed from $0.12 as of December 31, 2019 compared to $0.35 as of December 31, 2020. The fair value per warrant changed was $0.76 per warrant as of December 31, 2018.\nOther expenses, net. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had other expenses, net of $0.3 million as compared to other expenses net of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other expense, net was primarily comprised of foreign exchange losses of $0.1 million and other non-operating expenses of $0.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, other expense, net of $1.6 million was primarily comprised of foreign exchange losses of $1.4 million and other non-operating expenses of $0.2 million.\nIncome taxes. Income taxes went from an expense of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to a tax benefit of $55.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a change of $60.4 million or (1,321)%. This was primarily the result of reducing our valuation allowance by $65.7 million as we determined that it was more likely than not that we could benefit from our deferred tax assets based on all of the available evidence.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a working capital deficit of $42.7 million and we had an accumulated deficit of $225.8 million. We recorded net income of $75.2 million and $11.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRedemption of Series A Preferred Stock\nOn July 20, 2021, we redeemed the remaining 87,802 shares of our 13.00% Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate total redemption price of $88.4 million. The total redemption price consisted of $87.8 million related to the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a face value of $1,000 per share and $0.6 million related to the dividends earned for the period from July 1, 2021 through July 19, 2021. The redeemed shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, along with the dividends, were recorded on the redemption date of July 20, 2021.\nWe funded the redemption with borrowings from a five year term loan of $90 million, which was entered into on July 20, 2021 (the Credit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.50% and contains certain financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a total leverage ratio, and a minimum liquidity of $20 million in U.S. cash. Annual minimum principal payments over the five year term for the Credit Facility will be 5%, 5%, 7.5%, 7.5%, and 10%, respectively, with the remaining balance due at the end of the term.\nOn April 16, 2021, we redeemed 60,000 shares of our 13.00% Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate total redemption price of $62.3 million. The total price consisted of $60.0 million related to the face value of $1,000 per share of Series A Preferred Stock and $2.3 million related to the dividends to be earned for the period from April 1, 2021 through July 18, 2021. The redeemed shares of Series A Preferred Stock, along with the dividends were recorded when the Series A Preferred Stock became manditorily redeemable on April 16, 2021.\nOn March 11, 2021, we completed the March 2021 Offering of 7.8 million shares of our Common Stock at a price of $7.75 per share for total gross proceeds of $57.0 million. Net proceeds from the March 2021 Offering were $55.6 million after underwriter and offering expenses. We used the net proceeds from the March 2021 Offering to redeem 60,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock.\nOn January 5, 2021, we entered into an agreement with certain of the holders of its Series A Preferred Stock (the January 2021 Stock Repurchase Agreement\u201d) to repurchase 10,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the associated obligations pursuant to our Convertible Secured Promissory Notes outstanding in respect thereof (the Note Obligations\u201d) for\nan aggregate purchase price of approximately $9.0 million representing a discount to the face value of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock and no make-whole payments were required.\nThe holders of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled to, from the respective issuance date, a cash dividend of 10.0% per annum and a payment-in-kind dividend of 3.0% per annum for the first five years following the initial June 2018 closing and thereafter all dividends accruing on such Series A Preferred Stock will be payable in cash at a rate of 13.0% per annum.\nCredit Facility\nEffective July 20, 2021, we received $89.3 million of net proceeds related to the Credit Facility. The borrowings under the Credit Facility were discounted at 0.375%. As part of the transaction, we incurred issuance costs of $4.2 million, which were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d), plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.50%. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the interest rate on the Credit Facility was 2.4%.\nThe Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio greater than 1.25, a total leverage ratio less than 3.75, and a minimum liquidity of $20 million in U.S. cash. Annual minimum principal payments over the five year term for the Credit Facility will be 5%, 5%, 7.5%, 7.5%, and 10%, respectively, with the remaining balance due at the end of the term. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made principal payments of $2.3 million.\nPursuant to a Guaranty and Security Agreement, dated July 2, 2021 (the Guaranty and Security Agreement\u201d), among the Credit Parties and Capital One, National Association, as agent, the obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries (the Company and the guarantors, collectively, the Credit Parties\u201d) and are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and exceptions, by a lien on substantially all assets of the Credit Parties.\nRelated Party Note Payable to GP Sponsor\nUpon consummation of the merger with GP Investments Acquisition Corp. (\"GPIA\") in May 2017, an outstanding note payable to GP Sponsor with an initial face amount of approximately $3.0 million was assumed by the Company. This note was originally non-interest bearing and was not due and payable until the outstanding principal balance under the former Credit Facility was less than $95.0 million. At the inception of this note, the maturity date was expected to occur in June 2020 based on the scheduled principal payments under the Credit Facility. Interest was initially imputed under this note payable at the rate of 15.0% per annum. This note payable was amended twice in 2018, which resulted in further changes to the effective interest rate and maturity date.\nThe second amendment to the note payable was effective on December 21, 2018 and provided for an extension of the maturity date from January 4, 2019 to June 28, 2019. In addition, the parties agreed that the note payable would retroactively bear interest at 13.0% per annum from July 19, 2018 through the maturity date. Total retroactive interest amounted to $0.2 million which is accounted for as DDIC that was being accreted through the maturity date. We recognized accretion expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIn addition, the second amendment provided for monthly principal payments starting in December 2018 of approximately $0.4 million plus accrued interest. In December 2018, we made a payment of $0.6 million, primarily consisting of payment of retroactive interest of $0.2 million and the first monthly principal payment of $0.4 million. We made principal and interest payments totaling $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective interest rate for accretion of DDIC was 26.4% for the period from December 21, 2018 through June 28, 2019. The note was paid off on June 28, 2019.\nPlease refer to Notes 5 through 8 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for information regarding our Credit Facility, our Series A Preferred Stock and our Common Stock Offerings.\nA key component of our business model generally requires that customers prepay us annually for the services we will provide over the following year or longer. As a result, we collect cash from our customers in advance of when the related service costs are incurred, which resulted in deferred revenue of $253.2 million that is included in current liabilities as of December 31, 2021. Therefore, we believe that working capital deficit is not as meaningful in evaluating our liquidity since the costs of fulfilling our commitments to provide services to customers are currently limited to approximately 36% of the related deferred revenue based on our gross margin of 64% for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nFor the next 12 months, assuming that our operations are not significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $120.0 million as of December 31, 2021, plus future cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs including working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures, and our contractual obligations of approximately $12.8 million that are due during the 12 months ending December 31, 2022.\nAs discussed below in greater detail, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated cash flows from our operating activities of $66.9 million, which were derived from cash earnings of $37.4 million and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of $29.5 million. We believe our operating cash flows for the year ending December 31, 2021 will be sufficient to fund the portion of our contractual obligations that is not funded with existing capital resources.\nCash Flows Summary\nPresented below is a summary of our operating, investing and financing cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands): Table 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,103 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>(2,108) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,483) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>(26,565) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,375 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nA key component of our business model generally requires that customers prepay us annually for the services we will provide over the following year or longer. As a result, we collect cash in advance of the date when the vast majority of the related services are provided. During 2020, we focused on our collection efforts as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged to minimize the unfavorable impact of our accounts receivable. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $66.9 million and $42.1 million, respectively. The key components in the calculation of our cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,586 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash expenses, net </td> <td>(37,792) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,560 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net </td> <td>29,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,957 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,103 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $66.9 million. We recognized net income of $75.2 million, non-cash expenses resulting in a use of $37.8 million and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For year ended December 31, 2021, the non-cash expenses, net amounted to a use of $37.8 million and were comprised of the following; stock-based compensation expense of $9.7 million, amortization and accretion related to ROU assets and liabilities of $6.1 million, a loss from change in in fair value of redeemable warrants of $4.2 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $2.4 million, a non-cash impairment charge related to a ROU asset of $1.6 million and a write-off of debt discounts and issuance costs of $0.4 million. These expenses were offset by a change in our deferred tax asset provision which amounted to a benefit of $62.3 million, related primarily to the reduction in our valuation allowance during 2021.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, changes in operating assets and liabilities were favorable by $29.5 million to the operating cash flows due to an increase of deferred revenue of $47.3 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses, deposits, accrued liabilities for $3.5 million and accounts payable of $2.5 million. These favorable changes were offset by unfavorable changes in accounts receivable for $18.8 million, prepaid expenses, deposits and other assets for $3.5 million and deferred contract costs for $1.6 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $42.1 million. We recognized net income of $11.6 million, non-cash expenses of $17.6 million and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For year ended December 31, 2020, the non-cash expenses, net amounted to $17.6 million and were comprised of stock-based compensation expense of $7.5 million,\namortization and accretion related to ROU assets and liabilities of $6.2 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $1.8 million, a loss from change in in fair value of redeemable warrants of $1.4 million and a non-cash impairment charge related to a ROU asset of $1.2 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, changes in operating assets and liabilities were favorable by $13.0 million to the operating cash flows due to an increase of deferred revenue of $22.7 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses, deposits and other assets of $3.2 million, an increase in accrued liabilities of $1.6 million and an increase in accounts payable of $0.9 million. These favorable changes were offset by unfavorable changes in accounts receivable for $8.5 million and deferred contract costs for $6.9 million.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities were primarily driven by capital expenditures for leasehold improvements and computer equipment as we continued to invest in our business infrastructure and advance our geographic expansion. Such capital expenditures totaled $2.1 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, capital expenditures of $2.1 million consisted of new computer equipment and leasehold improvements of $1.1 million for our U.S. facilities, and $1.0 million for computer equipment at our foreign locations, primarily in India.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, capital expenditures of $1.5 million consisted of new computer equipment and leasehold improvements of $0.8 million for our U.S. facilities, and $0.7 million for computer equipment at our foreign locations, primarily in India.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cash utilized in financing activities of $26.6 million was attributable to payments to repurchase shares of Series A Preferred Stock totaling $156.8 million, which included $87.8 million in July 2021, $60.0 million in April 2021 and $9.0 million in January 2021; recurring dividend payments $9.7 million and a make-whole dividend payments of $2.9 million; payments related to debt issuance costs of $4.2 million; payments for professional fees associated with our March 2021 Offering of $1.3 million; principal payments related to the Credit Facility of $2.3 million; payments of $1.1 million related to treasury stock and capital lease payments of $0.4 million. These cash uses were offset by proceeds of $89.3 million from the new Credit Facility, proceeds of $57.0 million generated from the March 2021 Offering and proceeds of $5.9 million received from stock option exercises.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities of $6.4 million was attributable to net proceeds of $25.7 million generated from our August 2020 Offering and proceeds of $1.8 million received from stock option exercises. These cash proceeds were offset by dividend payments of $15.8 million, payments of $4.5 million related to repurchasing 5,000 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, payments for professional fees associated with our August 2020 Offering of $0.6 million and capital lease payments of $0.3 million.\nForeign Subsidiaries\nOur foreign subsidiaries and branches are dependent on our U.S.-based parent for continued funding. We currently do not intend to repatriate any amounts that have been invested overseas back to the U.S.-based parent. The imposition of the Transition Tax set forth in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 may reduce or eliminate U.S. federal deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. However, we may still be liable for withholding taxes, state taxes, or other income taxes that might be incurred upon the repatriation of foreign earnings. We have not made any provision for additional income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $51.3 million in our foreign subsidiaries.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations on an undiscounted basis as of December 31, 2021, and the period in which each contractual obligation is due (in thousands):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ending December 31: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments plus interest at 2.5% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,398 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating </td> <td>5,731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,576 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing </td> <td>405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,533 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,507 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWith respect to our significant accounting policies that are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, we believe that the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIncome Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC 740\u201d). Significant judgment is required in determining income tax benefit or expense and in evaluating uncertainties under ASC 740. Deferred taxes are recorded for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Valuation allowances are established when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company's deferred tax assets are primarily the result of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs\u201d) and tax credit carryforwards.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we released our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and recognized a $55.8 million income tax benefit. Management determined that, as a result of generating pretax earnings, utilization of net operating loss carryovers and projected pre-tax earnings, there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that its U.S. deferred taxes are realizable. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible, prior to the expiration of the tax attributes. The evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and forecasting future profitability.\nWe assessed the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize existing deferred tax assets within the applicable expiration period. While we believe that we have utilized a reasonable method to determine our deferred tax assets and the related release of our valuation allowance, should factors and\nconditions differ materially from those used by us, the actual realization of deferred tax assets could differ materially from the reported amounts.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If some amount within a range of probable loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of probable loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the range of the loss is estimable, then we disclose the range of the possible loss if the upper end of the range is material. If we cannot estimate the range of loss, we will disclose the reason why it cannot estimate the range of loss, if there is a reasonable possibility that the amount of loss may be material. We regularly evaluate current information available to it to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted and if a range of possible loss should be disclosed.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following accounting standards are not yet effective and management has not completed its evaluation of the recent accounting pronouncements to determine the impact that adoption of these standards will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-6, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). The guidance eliminates the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting for convertible instruments. The new guidance also modifies how particular convertible instruments and certain contracts that may be settled in cash or shares impact the diluted EPS computation. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2022. We are assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor additional information on recently issued and adopted accounting standards, please refer to the section titled Recent Accounting Pronouncements under Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRimini Street, Inc. (referred to as the Company\u201d, we\u201d and us\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware on October 10, 2017. As discussed below, the Company's predecessor was also named Rimini Street, Inc., a company incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 2005 and referred to herein as RSI. References to management\u201d or management team\u201d refer to the officers and directors of the Company and/or RSI as its predecessor.\nRimini Street, Inc. ( RSI\u201d) was incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 2005. RSI provides enterprise software support services. In May 2017, RSI entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with GP Investments Acquisition Corp. ( GPIA\u201d), a publicly-held special purpose acquisition company ( SPAC\u201d) incorporated in the Cayman Islands and formed for the purpose of effecting a business combination with one or more businesses. The Merger Agreement was approved by the respective shareholders of RSI and GPIA in October 2017, and closing occurred on October 10, 2017, resulting in (i) the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of GPIA with and into RSI, with RSI as the surviving corporation, after which (ii) RSI merged with and into GPIA, with GPIA as the surviving corporation and renamed Rimini\nStreet, Inc.\u201d (referred to herein as RMNI\u201d, as distinguished from RSI, which is defined as the predecessor entity with the same legal name) immediately after consummation of the second merger. As such, the consolidated financial results of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 presented in the consolidated financial statements reflect the operating results of RSI and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 can be found under Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" in our Annual Report on the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021, and is available on the SEC's website at sec.gov.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included in Item 8 of this Report. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A and elsewhere in this Report.\nCertain figures, such as interest rates and other percentages included in this section have been rounded for ease of presentation. Percentage figures included in this section have not in all cases been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in our consolidated financial statements or in the associated text. Certain other amounts that appear in this section may similarly not sum due to rounding.\nOverview\nRimini Street, Inc. and its subsidiaries (together, the Company or we\u201d) is a global provider of enterprise software support products and services, and the leading independent software support provider for Oracle and SAP products, based on both the number of active clients supported and recognition by industry analyst firms. We founded our company to disrupt and redefine the enterprise software support market by developing and delivering innovative new products and services that fill a then unmet need in the market. We believe we have achieved and sustained our leadership position in independent enterprise software support by delivering on our mission to provide extraordinary technology solutions that achieve each client's strategic, operational, and financial goals.\nEnterprise software support products and services is one of the largest categories of overall global information technology ( IT\u201d) spending. We believe core enterprise resource planning ( ERP\u201d), customer relationship management ( CRM\u201d), product lifecycle management ( PLM\u201d) and technology software platforms have become increasingly important in the operation of mission-critical business processes over the last 30 years, and also that the costs associated with failure, downtime, security exposure and maintaining the tax, legal and regulatory compliance of these core software systems have also increased. As a result, we believe that licensees often view software support as a mandatory cost of doing business, resulting in recurring and highly profitable revenue streams for enterprise software vendors. For example, for fiscal year 2021, SAP reported that support revenue represented approximately 41% of its total revenue and, for fiscal 2021, Oracle reported a margin of 85% for cloud services and license support.\nWe believe that software vendor support is an increasingly costly model that has not evolved to offer licensees the responsiveness, quality, breadth of capabilities or value needed to meet the needs of licensees. Organizations are under increasing pressure to reduce their IT costs while also delivering improved business performance through the adoption and integration of emerging technologies, such as mobile, virtualization, internet of things ( IoT\u201d) and cloud computing. Today, however, the majority of IT budget is spent operating and maintaining existing infrastructure and systems. As a result, we believe organizations are increasingly seeking ways to redirect budgets from maintenance to new technology investments that provide greater strategic value, and our software products and services help clients achieve these objectives by reducing the total cost of support.\nWe believe that AMS for enterprise software is a large market with significant unmet needs in client satisfaction and value. Traditional AMS providers compete on price, but the traditional AMS model is broken with a focus a land and expand\u201d model based on initial cheaper, less-skilled workers but higher costs over time and frequently poor client satisfaction or degradation in service over time. Providers usually contract for lower-cost services with a goal to grow revenue through scope creep by adding hours to open tickets or selling new project work. These lower-cost AMS support models sound cost-effective,\nbut their contractual structures can both enable and incent traditional AMS providers to maximize their own revenue at the expense of their clients by addressing\u201d issues (sometimes neither quickly nor efficiently), but not necessarily resolving them or their root causes. In addition, traditional AMS offerings are disparate and separate from software vendor support, with inherent inefficiencies and gaps that further limit responsiveness, root cause analysis and business value.\nWe believe organizations are realizing the value of an integrated, expert-led Support and AMS offering that eliminates inefficiencies, realizes joint value from the resolution of root causes that reduce issue volumes over time, and improves client satisfaction. Through our solution offerings, Rimini Street provides expert, ultra-responsive support and AMS, functioning as an extension of IT teams, with engineers available 24x7x365 around the globe for all AMS and enterprise software projects, and to fill skill gaps or help with rightsizing enterprise teams. Rimini Street teams deliver a wide variety of desired outcomes for a broad range of use cases such as supporting entire enterprise software systems, reducing costs, clearing backlogs, or facilitating the redeployment of IT teams for more strategic initiatives.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we employed over 1,660 professionals and supported over 2,840 active clients globally, including 72 Fortune 500 companies and 16 Fortune Global 100 companies across a broad range of industries. We define an active client as a distinct entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a business unit of a company that purchases our services to support a specific product. For example, we count as two separate active client instances in circumstances where we provide support for two different products to the same entity. We market and sell our services globally, primarily through our direct sales force, and have wholly-owned subsidiaries in Australia, Brazil, Canada, UAE (Dubai), France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. We believe our primary competitors are the enterprise software vendors whose products we service and support, including IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP.\nOur subscription-based revenue provides a strong foundation for, and visibility into, future period results. We generated revenue of $374.4 million, $326.8 million and $281.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021. 2020, and 2019, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of 15% and 16% for 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have a history of losses, and as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $225.8 million. We earned net income of $75.2 million, $11.6 million and $21.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We generated approximately 53% of our revenue in the United States and approximately 47% of our revenue from our international business for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations through cash collected from clients and net proceeds from equity financings and borrowings.\nWe intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We have invested and expect to continue investing in expanding our ability to market, sell and provide our current and future products and services to clients globally. We also expect to continue investing in the development and improvement of new and existing products and services to address client needs. We currently do not expect to be profitable in the near future.\nImpact of COVID-19\nNear the end of the first quarter of 2020, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic took hold and had widespread, rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets and business practices. These rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts continue as virus variants have resulted in additional outbreaks to date. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal and state governments have implemented multiple measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, quarantine guidance following travel to certain jurisdictions, limitations on public gatherings and continued closures of certain non-essential businesses, vaccination mandates or requirements for businesses to confirm employees' vaccination status, and other restrictions. As a result, to protect the health and well-being of our employees, clients and the communities in which we operate, we transitioned as many of our employees as possible to a work-at-home model, temporarily closed our offices worldwide, placed restrictions on non-essential business travel, transitioned to a no in-person event marketing strategy and implemented a fully remote sales model. We believe these measures have been successful and have not significantly affected our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have implemented business continuity measures and will continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic as circumstances dictate.\nAs a result of the measures that we have taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic described above, we have realized reduced costs of travel, reductions in costs resulting from cancelling certain in-person marketing events, reductions in office operating costs and potential rent abatement related to office closures around the world. While some of our offices have\npartially re-opened with limited staffing, our offices will not fully re-open until local authorities permit us to, and our own criteria and conditions to ensure employee health and safety are satisfied. We continue to expect to offset some of these reduced costs with accelerated investments including implementing virtual sales and other marketing programs, special compensation bonuses for lower-paid employees and special compensation bonuses for employees who have tested positive for COVID-19. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we paid COVID-19 special bonuses to certain of our employees to help with pandemic-related special costs and for the few of our employees who have tested positive for COVID-19. We have authorized COVID-19 special bonuses during pandemic that have been paid throughout 2020 and 2021. The cost of these special bonuses were more than offset by the cost reductions relating to travel and in-person marketing event fees and expenses described above.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had no significant net impact on our revenue or results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2021, and we continued to deliver uninterrupted and critical support services to our clients during this period. Our ability to utilize our secure remote-connectivity global infrastructure promotes the safety of our employees while abiding by the restrictions currently in place where they are located throughout the world. While we did implement discounted or extended payment terms for certain of our clients in 2020, in most cases it was in exchange for contractual concessions favorable to us, for example, extended contract terms or marketing support for references, and the collective impact of such changes was not material to our results. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted business markets worldwide, primarily due to the uncertainty relating to the continued effects of the pandemic. As a result, we have experienced some clients not renewing our services as their businesses have been adversely impacted during the pandemic. Despite this, we expect to continue to be able to market, sell and provide our current and future products and services to clients globally. We also expect to continue investing in the development and improvement of new and existing products and services to address client needs.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental and business actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as our clients' ability to pay for our services on an ongoing basis. This uncertainty also affects management's accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including receivables and forward-looking guidance. As such, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our financial results until future periods. Refer to Risk Factors\u201d (Part I, Item 1A of this Report) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) was signed into law in the United States to address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We elected to defer payroll tax payments which totaled $1.6 million as of December 31, 2021 as permitted by the CARES Act (such deferred payroll taxes are due in two installments: 50% by December 31, 2021 and 50% by December 31, 2022). We paid $1.6 million in December 2021 as required under the CARES Act. We continue to monitor any effects that may result from the CARES Act and other similar legislation or actions in geographies in which our business operates.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 27, 2022, our Board approved adoption of a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $15.0 million of our common stock both on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans, through March 4, 2024, subject to compliance with our Credit Agreement dated July 2, 2021, and amended January 14, 2022 to increase the amount of securities that could be purchased by us to approximately $15.0 million during the term of the facility, and other applicable legal requirements.\nOn July 20, 2021, we redeemed the remaining 87,802 shares of our 13.00% Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate total redemption price of $88.4 million. The total redemption price consisted of $87.8 million related to the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a face value of $1,000 per share and $0.6 million or $6.86 per share of Series A Preferred Stock related to the dividends earned for the period from July 1, 2021 through July 19, 2021. The redeemed shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, along with the dividends, were recorded on the redemption date of July 20, 2021.\nWe funded the July 20, 2021 redemption with borrowings from a five year secured term loan of $90 million, which was entered into on July 20, 2021 (the Credit Facility\u201d). Annual minimum principal payments over the five year term for the Credit Facility will be 5%, 5%, 7.5%, 7.5% and 10%, respectively, with the remaining balance due at the end of the term. See Note 5 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further information regarding our Credit Facility.\nOn April 16, 2021, we redeemed 60,000 shares of our 13.00% Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate total redemption price of $62.3 million. The total price consists of $60.0 million related to the face value of $1,000 per share of Series A Preferred Stock and $2.3 million or $39.05 per share of Series A Preferred Stock related to the dividends to be earned for the period from April 1, 2021 through July 18, 2021. The redeemed shares of Series A Preferred Stock, along with the dividends to be earned, were recorded when the Series A Preferred Stock became mandatorily redeemable on April 16, 2021.\nAdditionally, reference is made to Notes 5 and 6 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for a discussion of developments related to our Series A Preferred Stock and Credit Facility.\nOn March 11, 2021, we completed the March 2021 Offering of 7.8 million shares of our Common Stock at a price of $7.75 per share for total gross proceeds of $57.0 million. Underwriter discounts and commissions were $2.9 million and the underwriter expenses were $0.2 million. We also incurred additional professional fees and expenses of $1.3 million as part of the transaction, resulting in net proceeds from the March 2021 Offering of approximately $55.6 million. We used the net proceeds from the March 2021 Offering to redeem 60,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Reference is made to Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for information about the March 2021 Offering.\nAlso, reference is made to Note 10 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for a discussion of developments in our litigation with Oracle.\nOur Business Model\nWe believe most enterprise software vendors license the rights for customers to use their software. In a traditional licensing model, the customer typically procures a perpetual software license and pays for the license in a single upfront fee ( Perpetual License\u201d), and base software support services can be optionally procured from the software vendor for an annual fee that are typically 20-23% of the total cost of the software license. In a subscription-based licensing model, such as software as a service, or SaaS, the customer generally pays as it goes for usage of the software on a monthly or annual basis ( Subscription License\u201d). Under a Subscription License, the product license and a base level of software support are generally bundled together as a single purchase, and the base level of software support is not procured separately nor is it an optional purchase.\nWhen we provide base software support for a Perpetual License, we generally offer our clients service for a fee that is equal to approximately 50% of the annual fees charged by the software vendor for their base support. When providing supplemental software support for a Perpetual License, where the client procures our support service in addition to retaining the software vendor's base support, we generally offer our clients service for a fee that is equal to 25% of the annual fees charged by the software vendor for their base support. For supplemental software support on a Subscription License, we generally offer our clients services for a fee that is equal to 50% of the annual fees charged by the software vendor for their supplemental or premium support. We also offer a special support service, Rimini Street Extra Secure Support, for clients that require a higher level of security clearance for our engineers accessing their system. Rimini Street Extra Secure Support is an additional fee added to our base or supplemental support fee. Subscriptions for additional software products and services are available, designed to meet specific client needs and we believe provide exceptional value for the fees charged.\nOur subscription-based software support products and services offer enterprise software licensees a choice of solutions that replace or supplement the support products and services offered by enterprise software vendors for their products. Features, service levels, service breadth, technology and pricing differentiate our software products and services. We believe clients utilize our software products and services to achieve substantial cost savings; receive more responsive and comprehensive support; obtain support for their customized software that is not generally covered under the enterprise software vendor's service offerings; enhance their software functionality, capabilities, and data usage; and protect their systems and extend the life of their existing software releases and products. Our products and services enable our clients to keep their mission-critical systems operating smoothly and to remain in tax, legal and regulatory compliance; improve productivity; and better allocate limited budgets, labor and other resources to investments that provide competitive advantage and support growth.\nWe currently offer most of our support products and services on a subscription basis for a term that is generally 15 years in length with generally an initial, non-cancelable period of two to three years. The negotiated fees extend for the full term of the contract and usually include modest increases (averaging approximately three percent) after the initial non-cancelable period of each contract. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 80% of our invoicing was generated inside a non-cancelable period, and approximately 20% of our invoicing was generated outside of a non-cancelable period.\nAfter a non-cancelable period, our clients generally have the ability to terminate their support contracts on an annual basis upon a notice period generally ranging from 60 to 90 days prior to the end of the support period or renegotiate a mutually-agreeable, additional support period - including potentially an additional multi-year, non-cancelable support period. We generally invoice our clients annually in advance of the support period. We record amounts invoiced for support periods that have not yet occurred as deferred revenue on our balance sheet. We net any unpaid accounts receivable amounts relating to cancellable support periods against deferred revenue on our balance sheet.\nIn November 2019, we announced the global availability of our Application Management Systems (\"AMS\") for Oracle, which includes coverage for Oracle Database, Middleware and a wide range of Oracle applications including E-Business Suite, JD Edwards, PeopleSoft and Siebel. In addition to leveraging our support services for Oracle that replaces expensive and less robust software vendor annual support with a more responsive and comprehensive support offering, our clients can now have us manage their Oracle systems day-to-day with an integrated application management and support service provided by a single trusted vendor. As an integrated service, we believe we can provide clients a better model, better people, and better outcomes with higher satisfaction and significant savings of time, labor and money. The AMS for Oracle includes system administration, operational support, health monitoring and enhancement support.\nIn August 2019, we announced plans to globally offer AMS for SAP enterprise software, expanding the scope of support services we offer clients globally. This AMS service is in addition to our traditional enterprise Support Services. We are already providing this new SAP AMS service to clients in North and South America. The service includes system administration and SAP Basis support, system health monitoring with proactive analysis, preventative system recommendations and event detection; and enhancement support for complex SAP software landscapes.\nOur pricing model is a key component of our marketing and sales strategy and we believe delivers significant savings and value to our clients.\nKey Business Metrics\nNumber of clients\nSince we founded our company, we have made the expansion of our client base a priority. We believe that our ability to expand our client base is an indicator of the growth of our business, the success of our sales and marketing activities, and the value that our services bring to our clients. We define an active client as a distinct entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a business unit of a company that purchases our services to support a specific product. For example, we count as two separate active clients when support for two different products is being provided to the same entity. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had over 2,840, 2,480 and 2,060 active clients, respectively.\nWe define a unique client as a distinct entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution or a subsidiary, division or business unit of a company that purchases one or more of our products or services. We count as two separate unique clients when two separate subsidiaries, divisions or business units of an entity purchase our products or services. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had over 1,470, 1,310 and 1,160 unique clients, respectively.\nThe increase in both our active and unique client counts have been almost exclusively from new unique clients and not from sales of new products and services to existing unique clients. However, as noted previously, we intend to focus future growth on both new and existing clients. We believe that the growth in our number of clients is an indication of the increased adoption of our enterprise software products and services.\nAnnualized subscription revenue\nWe recognize subscription revenue on a daily basis. We define annualized subscription revenue as the amount of subscription revenue recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. This gives us an indication of the revenue that can be earned in the following 12-month period from our existing client base assuming no cancellations or price changes occur during that period. Subscription revenue excludes any non-recurring revenue, which has been insignificant to date. Our annualized subscription revenue was approximately $393 million, $349 million and $302 million as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenue retention rate\nA key part of our business model is the recurring nature of our revenue. As a result, it is important that we retain clients after the completion of the non-cancelable portion of the support period. We believe that our revenue retention rate provides insight into the quality of our products and services and the value that our products and services provide our clients.\nWe define revenue retention rate as the actual subscription revenue (dollar-based) recognized in a 12-month period from clients that existed on the day prior to the start of the 12-month period divided by our annualized subscription revenue as of the day prior to the start of the 12-month period. Our revenue retention rate was 92% for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nGross margin\nWe derive revenue through the sale of our enterprise software products and services. All the costs incurred in providing these products and services are recognized as part of the cost of revenue. The cost of revenue includes all direct product line expenses, as well as the expenses incurred by our shared services organization which supports all product lines.\nWe define gross profit as the difference between revenue and the costs incurred in providing the software products and services. Gross margin is the ratio of gross profit divided by revenue. Our gross margin was approximately 63.6%, 61.4% and 62.6% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe the gross margin provides an indication of how efficiently and effectively we are operating our business and serving our clients.\nFactors Affecting Our Operating Performance\nLitigation\nThe information from Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Item 1A, Risk Factors--Risks Related to Litigation- We and our Chief Executive Officer are involved in litigation with Oracle. An adverse outcome in the ongoing litigation could result in the payment of substantial damages and/or an injunction against certain of our business practices, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results,\u201d is incorporated by reference herein. For claims on which Oracle has prevailed or may prevail, we have been and could be required to pay substantial damages for our current or past business activities or be enjoined from certain business practices. Any of these outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdoption of enterprise software products and services\nWe believe the existing market for independent enterprise software support services is underserved. We currently provide support services for IBM, Microsoft, SAP, Oracle and other enterprise software vendors' products. We also believe the existing market for our other enterprise software products and services is underserved, and that we have unique products and services that can meet client needs in the marketplace. For example, we provide the Rimini Street Advanced Database Security product in partnership with McAfee, a global leader in cybersecurity.\nWe also believe that our total addressable market for our enterprise software products and services is substantially larger than our current client base and the products and services we currently offer. As a result, we believe we have the opportunity to expand our global client base and to further increase adoption of our software products and services within and across existing clients. However, as the market for independent enterprise software support services as well as our other software products and services is still emerging, it is difficult for us to predict the timing of when and if widespread acceptance will occur.\nSales cycle\nWe sell our services to our clients primarily through our direct sales organization. Our sales cycle, depending on the product or service, typically ranges from six months to a year from when a prospective client is engaged. While we believe that there is a significant market opportunity for our enterprise software products and services, we often must educate prospective clients about the value of our products and services, which can result in lengthy and multiple sales cycles, particularly for larger prospective clients, as well as the incurrence of significant marketing expenses. Our typical sales cycle with a prospective client begins with the generation of a sales lead through trade shows, industry events, online marketing, media interviews and articles, inbound calls, outbound calls or client, analyst or other referral. The sales lead is followed by an assessment of the prospect's current software license contract terms, systems environment, products and releases being used, needs and objectives.\nThe variability in our sales cycle for replacement or supplemental software support services is impacted by whether software vendors are able to convince potential clients that they should renew their software maintenance with the existing vendor or procure or renew supplemental support services from the existing vendor, respectively. Another driver of our sales cycle variability is any announcement by a software vendor of their discontinuation, reduction or limitation of support services for a particular software product or release for which we continue to offer a competing support service. In addition, our sales cycle variability is impacted by vendor discounts provided by software companies to retain existing clients or attract potential clients. Finally, our litigation with Oracle can also drive sales cycle variability as clients oftentimes perform their own legal due diligence, which can lengthen the sales cycle.\nKey Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations\nRevenue. We currently derive nearly all of our revenue from subscription-based contracts for software services. Revenue from these contracts is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the applicable service period.\nCost of revenue. Cost of revenue includes salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses associated with our technical support and services organization, as well as allocated overhead and non-personnel expenses such as outside services, professional fees and travel-related expenses. Allocated overhead includes overhead costs for depreciation of equipment, facilities (consisting of leasehold improvements and rent) and technical operations (including costs for compensation of our personnel and costs associated with our infrastructure). We recognize expenses related to our technical support and services organization as they are incurred.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our sales, marketing and business development employees and executives, amortization expense associated with capitalized sales commissions, sales commissions that do not qualify for capitalization, travel related expenses, outside services and allocated overhead. Sales commissions are costs of obtaining customer contracts and are capitalized and then amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be 4 years.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our administrative, legal, human resources, finance and accounting employees and executives. These expenses also include non-employee expenses, such as travel-related expenses, outside services, legal, auditing and other professional fees, and general corporate expenses, along with an allocation of our general overhead expenses.\nImpairment charges related to operating lease right-of-use assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment exists for property and equipment and other long-lived assets if the carrying amounts of such assets exceed the estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets. Impairment for intangible software assets is based upon an assessment of net realizable value. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset, or asset group, exceeds its fair value.\nLitigation costs and related recoveries, net. Litigation costs consist of legal settlements, pre-judgment interest, and third-party professional fees to defend against litigation claims. In the past, we have had liability insurance policies where a portion of our defense costs and litigation judgments or settlements have been reimbursed under the terms of the policies. Such insurance recoveries were reflected as a reduction of litigation costs upon notification of approval for reimbursement by the insurance company. For legal expenses related to Rimini II litigation, the deferred settlement liability was reduced with a corresponding reduction of legal expenses when the costs were incurred.\nInterest expense. Interest expense is incurred under our Credit Facility and other debt obligations. The components of interest expense include the amount of interest payable in cash at the stated interest rate, interest that is payable in kind through additional borrowings, make-whole applicable premium, and accretion of debt discounts and issuance costs ( DDIC\u201d) using the effective interest method.\nGain (loss) from change in fair value of redeemable warrants. We have revised certain prior period amounts on the audited condensed consolidated financial statements to correct a misstatement with respect to improperly classifying certain warrants to purchase approximately 6.1 million shares of our Common Stock, at $11.50 per share (the GP Sponsor Private Placement Warrants\u201d) as equity instead of as a warrant liability that is adjusted through charges or credits to the income statement each quarter to reflect changes in the fair value of the warrants, under the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 815-40, Contracts in Entity's Own Equity. The changes in the fair value of the GP Sponsor Private Placement Warrants are recorded each period through October 29, 2021.\nOther expenses, net. Other expenses, net consists primarily of gains or losses on foreign currency transactions, write-off of deferred debt financing costs related to unsuccessful financings, and interest income.\nIncome taxes. The provision for income taxes is based on the amount of our taxable income and enacted federal, state and foreign tax rates, as adjusted for allowable credits and deductions. Our provision for income taxes consists primarily of foreign taxes for the periods presented, as our taxable income for U.S. federal and state purposes is offset by net operating losses. In addition, based on all available evidence, we determined that it was more likely than not that we could benefit from our deferred tax assets, resulting in a tax benefit of $62.3 million in the current period. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In prior years, the domestic net deferred tax assets had been fully offset by a valuation allowance because of our lack of domestic earnings history.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years ended

In our consolidated financial statements, such costs are allocated between cost of revenue, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses based primarily on relative headcount, except for facilities which is based on occupancy.\nRevenue. Revenue increased from $326.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $374.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $47.7 million or 15%. The vast majority of this increase was driven by a 14% increase in the average number of unique clients, as opposed to existing unique clients subscribing to additional services. On a regional basis, United States revenue grew from $191.4 million for fiscal 2020 to $199.8 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $8.4 million or 4%, while international revenue grew from $135.3 million for fiscal 2020 to $174.6 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $39.3 million or 29%. Accelerated growth in our international business was driven by an increase in sales headcount primarily in Asia and Europe and an increase in marketing and advertising spend targeted for prospective clients outside the United States.\nCost of revenue. Total cost of revenue increased from $126.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $136.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $10.3 million or 8%. This increase was primarily due to additional support for the increasing number of clients that resulted in an increase in employee compensation and benefits of $11.1 million, an increase in all other costs of $1.4 million and an increase in allocated costs of $0.2 million. These cost increases were offset by a decrease in engineering consulting costs of $2.5 million.\nThe $11.1 million increase in cost of revenue attributable to employee compensation and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to (a) an increase in salaries, wages and benefit costs of $10.8 million due to a 16% increase in the average number of employees devoted to cost of revenue functions, annual pay increases, and increased bonus payouts. In addition, stock based compensation increased $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAs discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, in August 2018 Oracle obtained a permanent injunction from the District Court that prohibits us from using certain processes that could require us to incur additional labor costs to provide support for our clients as contracted. In September 2018, the Company filed a motion with the Court of Appeals, seeking a stay of the permanent injunction pending appeal and requesting a decision before the expiration of the temporary stay entered by the District Court. In November 2018, the Court of Appeals denied the Company's motion for a stay pending appeal of the injunction issued by the District Court without addressing the merits of the Company's appeal, and it confirmed the briefing schedule for the appeal. The briefing on our appeal to the Court of Appeals was completed in March 2019, and a hearing on our appeal occurred in July 2019. In August 2019, the Court of Appeals entered an order affirming the permanent injunction and the award of attorneys' fees that were previously paid to Oracle. However, the Court of Appeals agreed that the injunction was overbroad in two respects and instructed the District Court to remove the restriction on local hosting\u201d of J.D. Edwards and Siebel software and the prohibition against accessing\u201d J.D. Edwards and Siebel software source code. Since the date the temporary stay was lifted on the permanent injunction, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional expenses in the range of 1% to 2% of revenue for additional labor costs because, as drafted, the injunction contains language that could be read to cover some current support practices that are being litigated in the Rimini II\u201d lawsuit and that have not been found to be infringing.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased from $200.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $238.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $37.4 million or 19%. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 61.4% compared to 63.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $47.7 million or 15% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Total cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $10.3 million, or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Given that the increase in the cost of revenue was 8% compared to the increase in revenue of 15%, it resulted in a 220 basis points improvement in our gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the decline in engineering consulting costs and small increase in our allocated costs.\nSales and marketing expenses. As a percentage of our revenue, sales and marketing expenses have decreased from 35% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 34% for the year ended December 31, 2021. In dollar terms, sales and marketing expenses increased from $114.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $128.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $13.8 million or 12%. This increase was primarily due to (i) a $15.8 million increase in employee compensation and benefits as a result of a 16% increase in average headcount, (ii) an increase in trade show costs of $1.7 million, (iii) an increase in recruitment costs of $0.7 million and (iv) an increase of all other costs of $0.6 million. These increases were offset by declines in advertising, marketing and promotion costs and travel expenses of $2.0 million, $0.8 million and $2.3 million, respectively.\nThe $15.8 million increase in sales and marketing expense attributable to employee compensation and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to an increase in (i) salaries, wages and benefit costs of $12.6 million due to a 16% increase in the average number of employees devoted to sales and marketing functions, annual pay increases, and higher\nbonus payouts and (ii) commissions of $3.2 million due to new customer wins in excess of the prior year. Our overall spending increased as we attempt to accelerate our future revenue growth by investing in more resources.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased from $52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $64.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $12.0 million or 23%. This increase was primarily due to (i) increases in compensation and benefit costs of $10.3 million, (ii) an increase in computer software and license costs of $1.2 million, (iii) an increase of travel expenses of $0.9 million, (iv) an increase in other taxes of $0.4 million and (v) an increase in recruitment costs of $0.2 million. These unfavorable variances were offset, in part, by (i) a reduction of contract labor of $1.1 million, (ii) a favorable increase in administrative allocations of $0.6 million and (iii) a reduction in rent of $0.4 million.\nThe $10.3 million increase in general and administrative expenses attributable to employee compensation and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and benefit costs of $8.9 million due to a 12% increase in the average number of employees devoted to general and administrative functions, annual pay increases, and increased bonus payouts, and an increase of $1.4 million in stock-based compensation expense.\nWe expect to continue to incur higher expenses associated with supporting the growth of our business, both in terms of size and geographical diversity, and to meet the increased compliance requirements associated with being a public company. Public company costs that are expected to increase in the future include additional information systems costs, costs for additional personnel in our accounting, human resources, IT and legal functions, SEC and Nasdaq fees, and incremental professional, legal, audit and insurance costs. As a result, we currently expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in dollar terms in future periods.\nImpairment charges related to operating lease right-of-use assets. We recognized an impairment charge of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, related to two of our office leases as we ceased to use portions of our office space due to increased use of remote work which has occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLitigation costs and related recoveries, net. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, litigation costs and related recoveries, net consist of the following (in thousands): Table 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation settlement expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,530 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees and other defense costs of litigation </td> <td>16,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,964 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance recoveries, net </td> <td>(7,111) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,062 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,173) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Litigation costs, net of related insurance recoveries </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,876 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,321 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLitigation settlement expense increased from no expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Following nearly two years of discovery by Oracle, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to five of the items. With respect to the other five items, the District Court found the Company violated the permanent injunction, awarded sanctions to Oracle of $0.6 million and ordered that certain computer files be quarantined from use and notice and proof of such quarantining be provided to Oracle. The District Court also ruled that Oracle may recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. The Company has estimated those costs to be $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nProfessional fees and other defense costs associated with litigation increased from $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $3.0 million. This increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with discovery work on the Rimini II litigation and the Rimini I appeal during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInsurance costs and related recoveries, net decreased from a net cost of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to net benefit of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized costs of $1.1 million to revise the amount due to the insurance company (for portions of the Court of Appeals and U.S. Supreme Court awards), which we paid in September 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we received insurance proceeds of $7.1 million related to our litigation costs incurred as part of the injunction proceedings. We are self-insured for any costs related to any current or future intellectual property litigation. We currently believe our cash on hand, accounts receivable and contractually committed backlog provides us with sufficient liquidity to cover costs related to our litigation with Oracle.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased from $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $1.5 million. Interest expense increased primarily due to entering into a five-year Credit Facility for $90 million on July 20, 2021.\nLoss on change in fair value of redeemable warrants. Loss on change in fair value of redeemable warrants amounted to a loss of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a loss of $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The fair value per warrant changed from $0.35 per warrant as of December 31, 2020 to $1.04 per warrant as of October 29, 2021, which was the date whereby the GP Sponsor Warrants were determined to no longer be treated as a liability. The fair value per warrant changed from $0.12 as of December 31, 2019 compared to $0.35 as of December 31, 2020. The fair value per warrant changed was $0.76 per warrant as of December 31, 2018.\nOther expenses, net. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had other expenses, net of $0.3 million as compared to other expenses net of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other expense, net was primarily comprised of foreign exchange losses of $0.1 million and other non-operating expenses of $0.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, other expense, net of $1.6 million was primarily comprised of foreign exchange losses of $1.4 million and other non-operating expenses of $0.2 million.\nIncome taxes. Income taxes went from an expense of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to a tax benefit of $55.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a change of $60.4 million or (1,321)%. This was primarily the result of reducing our valuation allowance by $65.7 million as we determined that it was more likely than not that we could benefit from our deferred tax assets based on all of the available evidence.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a working capital deficit of $42.7 million and we had an accumulated deficit of $225.8 million. We recorded net income of $75.2 million and $11.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRedemption of Series A Preferred Stock\nOn July 20, 2021, we redeemed the remaining 87,802 shares of our 13.00% Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate total redemption price of $88.4 million. The total redemption price consisted of $87.8 million related to the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a face value of $1,000 per share and $0.6 million related to the dividends earned for the period from July 1, 2021 through July 19, 2021. The redeemed shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, along with the dividends, were recorded on the redemption date of July 20, 2021.\nWe funded the redemption with borrowings from a five year term loan of $90 million, which was entered into on July 20, 2021 (the Credit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.50% and contains certain financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a total leverage ratio, and a minimum liquidity of $20 million in U.S. cash. Annual minimum principal payments over the five year term for the Credit Facility will be 5%, 5%, 7.5%, 7.5%, and 10%, respectively, with the remaining balance due at the end of the term.\nOn April 16, 2021, we redeemed 60,000 shares of our 13.00% Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate total redemption price of $62.3 million. The total price consisted of $60.0 million related to the face value of $1,000 per share of Series A Preferred Stock and $2.3 million related to the dividends to be earned for the period from April 1, 2021 through July 18, 2021. The redeemed shares of Series A Preferred Stock, along with the dividends were recorded when the Series A Preferred Stock became manditorily redeemable on April 16, 2021.\nOn March 11, 2021, we completed the March 2021 Offering of 7.8 million shares of our Common Stock at a price of $7.75 per share for total gross proceeds of $57.0 million. Net proceeds from the March 2021 Offering were $55.6 million after underwriter and offering expenses. We used the net proceeds from the March 2021 Offering to redeem 60,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock.\nOn January 5, 2021, we entered into an agreement with certain of the holders of its Series A Preferred Stock (the January 2021 Stock Repurchase Agreement\u201d) to repurchase 10,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the associated obligations pursuant to our Convertible Secured Promissory Notes outstanding in respect thereof (the Note Obligations\u201d) for\nan aggregate purchase price of approximately $9.0 million representing a discount to the face value of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock and no make-whole payments were required.\nThe holders of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled to, from the respective issuance date, a cash dividend of 10.0% per annum and a payment-in-kind dividend of 3.0% per annum for the first five years following the initial June 2018 closing and thereafter all dividends accruing on such Series A Preferred Stock will be payable in cash at a rate of 13.0% per annum.\nCredit Facility\nEffective July 20, 2021, we received $89.3 million of net proceeds related to the Credit Facility. The borrowings under the Credit Facility were discounted at 0.375%. As part of the transaction, we incurred issuance costs of $4.2 million, which were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d), plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.50%. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the interest rate on the Credit Facility was 2.4%.\nThe Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio greater than 1.25, a total leverage ratio less than 3.75, and a minimum liquidity of $20 million in U.S. cash. Annual minimum principal payments over the five year term for the Credit Facility will be 5%, 5%, 7.5%, 7.5%, and 10%, respectively, with the remaining balance due at the end of the term. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made principal payments of $2.3 million.\nPursuant to a Guaranty and Security Agreement, dated July 2, 2021 (the Guaranty and Security Agreement\u201d), among the Credit Parties and Capital One, National Association, as agent, the obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries (the Company and the guarantors, collectively, the Credit Parties\u201d) and are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and exceptions, by a lien on substantially all assets of the Credit Parties.\nRelated Party Note Payable to GP Sponsor\nUpon consummation of the merger with GP Investments Acquisition Corp. (\"GPIA\") in May 2017, an outstanding note payable to GP Sponsor with an initial face amount of approximately $3.0 million was assumed by the Company. This note was originally non-interest bearing and was not due and payable until the outstanding principal balance under the former Credit Facility was less than $95.0 million. At the inception of this note, the maturity date was expected to occur in June 2020 based on the scheduled principal payments under the Credit Facility. Interest was initially imputed under this note payable at the rate of 15.0% per annum. This note payable was amended twice in 2018, which resulted in further changes to the effective interest rate and maturity date.\nThe second amendment to the note payable was effective on December 21, 2018 and provided for an extension of the maturity date from January 4, 2019 to June 28, 2019. In addition, the parties agreed that the note payable would retroactively bear interest at 13.0% per annum from July 19, 2018 through the maturity date. Total retroactive interest amounted to $0.2 million which is accounted for as DDIC that was being accreted through the maturity date. We recognized accretion expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIn addition, the second amendment provided for monthly principal payments starting in December 2018 of approximately $0.4 million plus accrued interest. In December 2018, we made a payment of $0.6 million, primarily consisting of payment of retroactive interest of $0.2 million and the first monthly principal payment of $0.4 million. We made principal and interest payments totaling $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective interest rate for accretion of DDIC was 26.4% for the period from December 21, 2018 through June 28, 2019. The note was paid off on June 28, 2019.\nPlease refer to Notes 5 through 8 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for information regarding our Credit Facility, our Series A Preferred Stock and our Common Stock Offerings.\nA key component of our business model generally requires that customers prepay us annually for the services we will provide over the following year or longer. As a result, we collect cash from our customers in advance of when the related service costs are incurred, which resulted in deferred revenue of $253.2 million that is included in current liabilities as of December 31, 2021. Therefore, we believe that working capital deficit is not as meaningful in evaluating our liquidity since the costs of fulfilling our commitments to provide services to customers are currently limited to approximately 36% of the related deferred revenue based on our gross margin of 64% for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nFor the next 12 months, assuming that our operations are not significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $120.0 million as of December 31, 2021, plus future cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs including working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures, and our contractual obligations of approximately $12.8 million that are due during the 12 months ending December 31, 2022.\nAs discussed below in greater detail, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated cash flows from our operating activities of $66.9 million, which were derived from cash earnings of $37.4 million and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of $29.5 million. We believe our operating cash flows for the year ending December 31, 2021 will be sufficient to fund the portion of our contractual obligations that is not funded with existing capital resources.\nCash Flows Summary\nPresented below is a summary of our operating, investing and financing cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands): Table 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,103 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>(2,108) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,483) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>(26,565) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,375 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nA key component of our business model generally requires that customers prepay us annually for the services we will provide over the following year or longer. As a result, we collect cash in advance of the date when the vast majority of the related services are provided. During 2020, we focused on our collection efforts as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged to minimize the unfavorable impact of our accounts receivable. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $66.9 million and $42.1 million, respectively. The key components in the calculation of our cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,586 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash expenses, net </td> <td>(37,792) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,560 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net </td> <td>29,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,957 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,103 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $66.9 million. We recognized net income of $75.2 million, non-cash expenses resulting in a use of $37.8 million and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For year ended December 31, 2021, the non-cash expenses, net amounted to a use of $37.8 million and were comprised of the following; stock-based compensation expense of $9.7 million, amortization and accretion related to ROU assets and liabilities of $6.1 million, a loss from change in in fair value of redeemable warrants of $4.2 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $2.4 million, a non-cash impairment charge related to a ROU asset of $1.6 million and a write-off of debt discounts and issuance costs of $0.4 million. These expenses were offset by a change in our deferred tax asset provision which amounted to a benefit of $62.3 million, related primarily to the reduction in our valuation allowance during 2021.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, changes in operating assets and liabilities were favorable by $29.5 million to the operating cash flows due to an increase of deferred revenue of $47.3 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses, deposits, accrued liabilities for $3.5 million and accounts payable of $2.5 million. These favorable changes were offset by unfavorable changes in accounts receivable for $18.8 million, prepaid expenses, deposits and other assets for $3.5 million and deferred contract costs for $1.6 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $42.1 million. We recognized net income of $11.6 million, non-cash expenses of $17.6 million and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For year ended December 31, 2020, the non-cash expenses, net amounted to $17.6 million and were comprised of stock-based compensation expense of $7.5 million,\namortization and accretion related to ROU assets and liabilities of $6.2 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $1.8 million, a loss from change in in fair value of redeemable warrants of $1.4 million and a non-cash impairment charge related to a ROU asset of $1.2 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, changes in operating assets and liabilities were favorable by $13.0 million to the operating cash flows due to an increase of deferred revenue of $22.7 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses, deposits and other assets of $3.2 million, an increase in accrued liabilities of $1.6 million and an increase in accounts payable of $0.9 million. These favorable changes were offset by unfavorable changes in accounts receivable for $8.5 million and deferred contract costs for $6.9 million.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities were primarily driven by capital expenditures for leasehold improvements and computer equipment as we continued to invest in our business infrastructure and advance our geographic expansion. Such capital expenditures totaled $2.1 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, capital expenditures of $2.1 million consisted of new computer equipment and leasehold improvements of $1.1 million for our U.S. facilities, and $1.0 million for computer equipment at our foreign locations, primarily in India.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, capital expenditures of $1.5 million consisted of new computer equipment and leasehold improvements of $0.8 million for our U.S. facilities, and $0.7 million for computer equipment at our foreign locations, primarily in India.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cash utilized in financing activities of $26.6 million was attributable to payments to repurchase shares of Series A Preferred Stock totaling $156.8 million, which included $87.8 million in July 2021, $60.0 million in April 2021 and $9.0 million in January 2021; recurring dividend payments $9.7 million and a make-whole dividend payments of $2.9 million; payments related to debt issuance costs of $4.2 million; payments for professional fees associated with our March 2021 Offering of $1.3 million; principal payments related to the Credit Facility of $2.3 million; payments of $1.1 million related to treasury stock and capital lease payments of $0.4 million. These cash uses were offset by proceeds of $89.3 million from the new Credit Facility, proceeds of $57.0 million generated from the March 2021 Offering and proceeds of $5.9 million received from stock option exercises.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities of $6.4 million was attributable to net proceeds of $25.7 million generated from our August 2020 Offering and proceeds of $1.8 million received from stock option exercises. These cash proceeds were offset by dividend payments of $15.8 million, payments of $4.5 million related to repurchasing 5,000 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, payments for professional fees associated with our August 2020 Offering of $0.6 million and capital lease payments of $0.3 million.\nForeign Subsidiaries\nOur foreign subsidiaries and branches are dependent on our U.S.-based parent for continued funding. We currently do not intend to repatriate any amounts that have been invested overseas back to the U.S.-based parent. The imposition of the Transition Tax set forth in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 may reduce or eliminate U.S. federal deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. However, we may still be liable for withholding taxes, state taxes, or other income taxes that might be incurred upon the repatriation of foreign earnings. We have not made any provision for additional income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $51.3 million in our foreign subsidiaries.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations on an undiscounted basis as of December 31, 2021, and the period in which each contractual obligation is due (in thousands):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ending December 31: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Facility </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments plus interest at 2.5% </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,398 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating </td> <td>5,731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,322 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,576 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing </td> <td>405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,533 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,507 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWith respect to our significant accounting policies that are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, we believe that the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIncome Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC 740\u201d). Significant judgment is required in determining income tax benefit or expense and in evaluating uncertainties under ASC 740. Deferred taxes are recorded for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Valuation allowances are established when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company's deferred tax assets are primarily the result of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs\u201d) and tax credit carryforwards.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we released our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and recognized a $55.8 million income tax benefit. Management determined that, as a result of generating pretax earnings, utilization of net operating loss carryovers and projected pre-tax earnings, there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that its U.S. deferred taxes are realizable. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible, prior to the expiration of the tax attributes. The evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and forecasting future profitability.\nWe assessed the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize existing deferred tax assets within the applicable expiration period. While we believe that we have utilized a reasonable method to determine our deferred tax assets and the related release of our valuation allowance, should factors and\nconditions differ materially from those used by us, the actual realization of deferred tax assets could differ materially from the reported amounts.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If some amount within a range of probable loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of probable loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the range of the loss is estimable, then we disclose the range of the possible loss if the upper end of the range is material. If we cannot estimate the range of loss, we will disclose the reason why it cannot estimate the range of loss, if there is a reasonable possibility that the amount of loss may be material. We regularly evaluate current information available to it to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted and if a range of possible loss should be disclosed.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following accounting standards are not yet effective and management has not completed its evaluation of the recent accounting pronouncements to determine the impact that adoption of these standards will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-6, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). The guidance eliminates the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting for convertible instruments. The new guidance also modifies how particular convertible instruments and certain contracts that may be settled in cash or shares impact the diluted EPS computation. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2022. We are assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor additional information on recently issued and adopted accounting standards, please refer to the section titled Recent Accounting Pronouncements under Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRimini Street, Inc. (referred to as the Company\u201d, we\u201d and us\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware on October 10, 2017. As discussed below, the Company's predecessor was also named Rimini Street, Inc., a company incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 2005 and referred to herein as RSI. References to management\u201d or management team\u201d refer to the officers and directors of the Company and/or RSI as its predecessor.\nRimini Street, Inc. ( RSI\u201d) was incorporated in the state of Nevada in September 2005. RSI provides enterprise software support services. In May 2017, RSI entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with GP Investments Acquisition Corp. ( GPIA\u201d), a publicly-held special purpose acquisition company ( SPAC\u201d) incorporated in the Cayman Islands and formed for the purpose of effecting a business combination with one or more businesses. The Merger Agreement was approved by the respective shareholders of RSI and GPIA in October 2017, and closing occurred on October 10, 2017, resulting in (i) the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of GPIA with and into RSI, with RSI as the surviving corporation, after which (ii) RSI merged with and into GPIA, with GPIA as the surviving corporation and renamed Rimini\nStreet, Inc.\u201d (referred to herein as RMNI\u201d, as distinguished from RSI, which is defined as the predecessor entity with the same legal name) immediately after consummation of the second merger. As such, the consolidated financial results of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 presented in the consolidated financial statements reflect the operating results of RSI and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 can be found under Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" in our Annual Report on the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on March 3, 2021, and is available on the SEC's website at sec.gov.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included in Item 8 of this Report. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A and elsewhere in this Report.\nCertain figures, such as interest rates and other percentages included in this section have been rounded for ease of presentation. Percentage figures included in this section have not in all cases been calculated on the basis of such rounded figures but on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding. For this reason, percentage amounts in this section may vary slightly from those obtained by performing the same calculations using the figures in our consolidated financial statements or in the associated text. Certain other amounts that appear in this section may similarly not sum due to rounding.\nOverview\nRimini Street, Inc. and its subsidiaries (together, the Company or we\u201d) is a global provider of enterprise software support products and services, and the leading independent software support provider for Oracle and SAP products, based on both the number of active clients supported and recognition by industry analyst firms. We founded our company to disrupt and redefine the enterprise software support market by developing and delivering innovative new products and services that fill a then unmet need in the market. We believe we have achieved and sustained our leadership position in independent enterprise software support by delivering on our mission to provide extraordinary technology solutions that achieve each client's strategic, operational, and financial goals.\nEnterprise software support products and services is one of the largest categories of overall global information technology ( IT\u201d) spending. We believe core enterprise resource planning ( ERP\u201d), customer relationship management ( CRM\u201d), product lifecycle management ( PLM\u201d) and technology software platforms have become increasingly important in the operation of mission-critical business processes over the last 30 years, and also that the costs associated with failure, downtime, security exposure and maintaining the tax, legal and regulatory compliance of these core software systems have also increased. As a result, we believe that licensees often view software support as a mandatory cost of doing business, resulting in recurring and highly profitable revenue streams for enterprise software vendors. For example, for fiscal year 2021, SAP reported that support revenue represented approximately 41% of its total revenue and, for fiscal 2021, Oracle reported a margin of 85% for cloud services and license support.\nWe believe that software vendor support is an increasingly costly model that has not evolved to offer licensees the responsiveness, quality, breadth of capabilities or value needed to meet the needs of licensees. Organizations are under increasing pressure to reduce their IT costs while also delivering improved business performance through the adoption and integration of emerging technologies, such as mobile, virtualization, internet of things ( IoT\u201d) and cloud computing. Today, however, the majority of IT budget is spent operating and maintaining existing infrastructure and systems. As a result, we believe organizations are increasingly seeking ways to redirect budgets from maintenance to new technology investments that provide greater strategic value, and our software products and services help clients achieve these objectives by reducing the total cost of support.\nWe believe that AMS for enterprise software is a large market with significant unmet needs in client satisfaction and value. Traditional AMS providers compete on price, but the traditional AMS model is broken with a focus a land and expand\u201d model based on initial cheaper, less-skilled workers but higher costs over time and frequently poor client satisfaction or degradation in service over time. Providers usually contract for lower-cost services with a goal to grow revenue through scope creep by adding hours to open tickets or selling new project work. These lower-cost AMS support models sound cost-effective,\nbut their contractual structures can both enable and incent traditional AMS providers to maximize their own revenue at the expense of their clients by addressing\u201d issues (sometimes neither quickly nor efficiently), but not necessarily resolving them or their root causes. In addition, traditional AMS offerings are disparate and separate from software vendor support, with inherent inefficiencies and gaps that further limit responsiveness, root cause analysis and business value.\nWe believe organizations are realizing the value of an integrated, expert-led Support and AMS offering that eliminates inefficiencies, realizes joint value from the resolution of root causes that reduce issue volumes over time, and improves client satisfaction. Through our solution offerings, Rimini Street provides expert, ultra-responsive support and AMS, functioning as an extension of IT teams, with engineers available 24x7x365 around the globe for all AMS and enterprise software projects, and to fill skill gaps or help with rightsizing enterprise teams. Rimini Street teams deliver a wide variety of desired outcomes for a broad range of use cases such as supporting entire enterprise software systems, reducing costs, clearing backlogs, or facilitating the redeployment of IT teams for more strategic initiatives.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we employed over 1,660 professionals and supported over 2,840 active clients globally, including 72 Fortune 500 companies and 16 Fortune Global 100 companies across a broad range of industries. We define an active client as a distinct entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a business unit of a company that purchases our services to support a specific product. For example, we count as two separate active client instances in circumstances where we provide support for two different products to the same entity. We market and sell our services globally, primarily through our direct sales force, and have wholly-owned subsidiaries in Australia, Brazil, Canada, UAE (Dubai), France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. We believe our primary competitors are the enterprise software vendors whose products we service and support, including IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP.\nOur subscription-based revenue provides a strong foundation for, and visibility into, future period results. We generated revenue of $374.4 million, $326.8 million and $281.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021. 2020, and 2019, respectively, representing a year-over-year increase of 15% and 16% for 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have a history of losses, and as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $225.8 million. We earned net income of $75.2 million, $11.6 million and $21.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We generated approximately 53% of our revenue in the United States and approximately 47% of our revenue from our international business for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations through cash collected from clients and net proceeds from equity financings and borrowings.\nWe intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We have invested and expect to continue investing in expanding our ability to market, sell and provide our current and future products and services to clients globally. We also expect to continue investing in the development and improvement of new and existing products and services to address client needs. We currently do not expect to be profitable in the near future.\nImpact of COVID-19\nNear the end of the first quarter of 2020, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic took hold and had widespread, rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets and business practices. These rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts continue as virus variants have resulted in additional outbreaks to date. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal and state governments have implemented multiple measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, quarantine guidance following travel to certain jurisdictions, limitations on public gatherings and continued closures of certain non-essential businesses, vaccination mandates or requirements for businesses to confirm employees' vaccination status, and other restrictions. As a result, to protect the health and well-being of our employees, clients and the communities in which we operate, we transitioned as many of our employees as possible to a work-at-home model, temporarily closed our offices worldwide, placed restrictions on non-essential business travel, transitioned to a no in-person event marketing strategy and implemented a fully remote sales model. We believe these measures have been successful and have not significantly affected our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have implemented business continuity measures and will continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic as circumstances dictate.\nAs a result of the measures that we have taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic described above, we have realized reduced costs of travel, reductions in costs resulting from cancelling certain in-person marketing events, reductions in office operating costs and potential rent abatement related to office closures around the world. While some of our offices have\npartially re-opened with limited staffing, our offices will not fully re-open until local authorities permit us to, and our own criteria and conditions to ensure employee health and safety are satisfied. We continue to expect to offset some of these reduced costs with accelerated investments including implementing virtual sales and other marketing programs, special compensation bonuses for lower-paid employees and special compensation bonuses for employees who have tested positive for COVID-19. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we paid COVID-19 special bonuses to certain of our employees to help with pandemic-related special costs and for the few of our employees who have tested positive for COVID-19. We have authorized COVID-19 special bonuses during pandemic that have been paid throughout 2020 and 2021. The cost of these special bonuses were more than offset by the cost reductions relating to travel and in-person marketing event fees and expenses described above.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had no significant net impact on our revenue or results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2021, and we continued to deliver uninterrupted and critical support services to our clients during this period. Our ability to utilize our secure remote-connectivity global infrastructure promotes the safety of our employees while abiding by the restrictions currently in place where they are located throughout the world. While we did implement discounted or extended payment terms for certain of our clients in 2020, in most cases it was in exchange for contractual concessions favorable to us, for example, extended contract terms or marketing support for references, and the collective impact of such changes was not material to our results. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted business markets worldwide, primarily due to the uncertainty relating to the continued effects of the pandemic. As a result, we have experienced some clients not renewing our services as their businesses have been adversely impacted during the pandemic. Despite this, we expect to continue to be able to market, sell and provide our current and future products and services to clients globally. We also expect to continue investing in the development and improvement of new and existing products and services to address client needs.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental and business actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as our clients' ability to pay for our services on an ongoing basis. This uncertainty also affects management's accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including receivables and forward-looking guidance. As such, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our financial results until future periods. Refer to Risk Factors\u201d (Part I, Item 1A of this Report) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act\u201d) was signed into law in the United States to address the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We elected to defer payroll tax payments which totaled $1.6 million as of December 31, 2021 as permitted by the CARES Act (such deferred payroll taxes are due in two installments: 50% by December 31, 2021 and 50% by December 31, 2022). We paid $1.6 million in December 2021 as required under the CARES Act. We continue to monitor any effects that may result from the CARES Act and other similar legislation or actions in geographies in which our business operates.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 27, 2022, our Board approved adoption of a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $15.0 million of our common stock both on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans, through March 4, 2024, subject to compliance with our Credit Agreement dated July 2, 2021, and amended January 14, 2022 to increase the amount of securities that could be purchased by us to approximately $15.0 million during the term of the facility, and other applicable legal requirements.\nOn July 20, 2021, we redeemed the remaining 87,802 shares of our 13.00% Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate total redemption price of $88.4 million. The total redemption price consisted of $87.8 million related to the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a face value of $1,000 per share and $0.6 million or $6.86 per share of Series A Preferred Stock related to the dividends earned for the period from July 1, 2021 through July 19, 2021. The redeemed shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, along with the dividends, were recorded on the redemption date of July 20, 2021.\nWe funded the July 20, 2021 redemption with borrowings from a five year secured term loan of $90 million, which was entered into on July 20, 2021 (the Credit Facility\u201d). Annual minimum principal payments over the five year term for the Credit Facility will be 5%, 5%, 7.5%, 7.5% and 10%, respectively, with the remaining balance due at the end of the term. See Note 5 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further information regarding our Credit Facility.\nOn April 16, 2021, we redeemed 60,000 shares of our 13.00% Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate total redemption price of $62.3 million. The total price consists of $60.0 million related to the face value of $1,000 per share of Series A Preferred Stock and $2.3 million or $39.05 per share of Series A Preferred Stock related to the dividends to be earned for the period from April 1, 2021 through July 18, 2021. The redeemed shares of Series A Preferred Stock, along with the dividends to be earned, were recorded when the Series A Preferred Stock became mandatorily redeemable on April 16, 2021.\nAdditionally, reference is made to Notes 5 and 6 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for a discussion of developments related to our Series A Preferred Stock and Credit Facility.\nOn March 11, 2021, we completed the March 2021 Offering of 7.8 million shares of our Common Stock at a price of $7.75 per share for total gross proceeds of $57.0 million. Underwriter discounts and commissions were $2.9 million and the underwriter expenses were $0.2 million. We also incurred additional professional fees and expenses of $1.3 million as part of the transaction, resulting in net proceeds from the March 2021 Offering of approximately $55.6 million. We used the net proceeds from the March 2021 Offering to redeem 60,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Reference is made to Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for information about the March 2021 Offering.\nAlso, reference is made to Note 10 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for a discussion of developments in our litigation with Oracle.\nOur Business Model\nWe believe most enterprise software vendors license the rights for customers to use their software. In a traditional licensing model, the customer typically procures a perpetual software license and pays for the license in a single upfront fee ( Perpetual License\u201d), and base software support services can be optionally procured from the software vendor for an annual fee that are typically 20-23% of the total cost of the software license. In a subscription-based licensing model, such as software as a service, or SaaS, the customer generally pays as it goes for usage of the software on a monthly or annual basis ( Subscription License\u201d). Under a Subscription License, the product license and a base level of software support are generally bundled together as a single purchase, and the base level of software support is not procured separately nor is it an optional purchase.\nWhen we provide base software support for a Perpetual License, we generally offer our clients service for a fee that is equal to approximately 50% of the annual fees charged by the software vendor for their base support. When providing supplemental software support for a Perpetual License, where the client procures our support service in addition to retaining the software vendor's base support, we generally offer our clients service for a fee that is equal to 25% of the annual fees charged by the software vendor for their base support. For supplemental software support on a Subscription License, we generally offer our clients services for a fee that is equal to 50% of the annual fees charged by the software vendor for their supplemental or premium support. We also offer a special support service, Rimini Street Extra Secure Support, for clients that require a higher level of security clearance for our engineers accessing their system. Rimini Street Extra Secure Support is an additional fee added to our base or supplemental support fee. Subscriptions for additional software products and services are available, designed to meet specific client needs and we believe provide exceptional value for the fees charged.\nOur subscription-based software support products and services offer enterprise software licensees a choice of solutions that replace or supplement the support products and services offered by enterprise software vendors for their products. Features, service levels, service breadth, technology and pricing differentiate our software products and services. We believe clients utilize our software products and services to achieve substantial cost savings; receive more responsive and comprehensive support; obtain support for their customized software that is not generally covered under the enterprise software vendor's service offerings; enhance their software functionality, capabilities, and data usage; and protect their systems and extend the life of their existing software releases and products. Our products and services enable our clients to keep their mission-critical systems operating smoothly and to remain in tax, legal and regulatory compliance; improve productivity; and better allocate limited budgets, labor and other resources to investments that provide competitive advantage and support growth.\nWe currently offer most of our support products and services on a subscription basis for a term that is generally 15 years in length with generally an initial, non-cancelable period of two to three years. The negotiated fees extend for the full term of the contract and usually include modest increases (averaging approximately three percent) after the initial non-cancelable period of each contract. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 80% of our invoicing was generated inside a non-cancelable period, and approximately 20% of our invoicing was generated outside of a non-cancelable period.\nAfter a non-cancelable period, our clients generally have the ability to terminate their support contracts on an annual basis upon a notice period generally ranging from 60 to 90 days prior to the end of the support period or renegotiate a mutually-agreeable, additional support period - including potentially an additional multi-year, non-cancelable support period. We generally invoice our clients annually in advance of the support period. We record amounts invoiced for support periods that have not yet occurred as deferred revenue on our balance sheet. We net any unpaid accounts receivable amounts relating to cancellable support periods against deferred revenue on our balance sheet.\nIn November 2019, we announced the global availability of our Application Management Systems (\"AMS\") for Oracle, which includes coverage for Oracle Database, Middleware and a wide range of Oracle applications including E-Business Suite, JD Edwards, PeopleSoft and Siebel. In addition to leveraging our support services for Oracle that replaces expensive and less robust software vendor annual support with a more responsive and comprehensive support offering, our clients can now have us manage their Oracle systems day-to-day with an integrated application management and support service provided by a single trusted vendor. As an integrated service, we believe we can provide clients a better model, better people, and better outcomes with higher satisfaction and significant savings of time, labor and money. The AMS for Oracle includes system administration, operational support, health monitoring and enhancement support.\nIn August 2019, we announced plans to globally offer AMS for SAP enterprise software, expanding the scope of support services we offer clients globally. This AMS service is in addition to our traditional enterprise Support Services. We are already providing this new SAP AMS service to clients in North and South America. The service includes system administration and SAP Basis support, system health monitoring with proactive analysis, preventative system recommendations and event detection; and enhancement support for complex SAP software landscapes.\nOur pricing model is a key component of our marketing and sales strategy and we believe delivers significant savings and value to our clients.\nKey Business Metrics\nNumber of clients\nSince we founded our company, we have made the expansion of our client base a priority. We believe that our ability to expand our client base is an indicator of the growth of our business, the success of our sales and marketing activities, and the value that our services bring to our clients. We define an active client as a distinct entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a business unit of a company that purchases our services to support a specific product. For example, we count as two separate active clients when support for two different products is being provided to the same entity. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had over 2,840, 2,480 and 2,060 active clients, respectively.\nWe define a unique client as a distinct entity, such as a company, an educational or government institution or a subsidiary, division or business unit of a company that purchases one or more of our products or services. We count as two separate unique clients when two separate subsidiaries, divisions or business units of an entity purchase our products or services. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had over 1,470, 1,310 and 1,160 unique clients, respectively.\nThe increase in both our active and unique client counts have been almost exclusively from new unique clients and not from sales of new products and services to existing unique clients. However, as noted previously, we intend to focus future growth on both new and existing clients. We believe that the growth in our number of clients is an indication of the increased adoption of our enterprise software products and services.\nAnnualized subscription revenue\nWe recognize subscription revenue on a daily basis. We define annualized subscription revenue as the amount of subscription revenue recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. This gives us an indication of the revenue that can be earned in the following 12-month period from our existing client base assuming no cancellations or price changes occur during that period. Subscription revenue excludes any non-recurring revenue, which has been insignificant to date. Our annualized subscription revenue was approximately $393 million, $349 million and $302 million as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenue retention rate\nA key part of our business model is the recurring nature of our revenue. As a result, it is important that we retain clients after the completion of the non-cancelable portion of the support period. We believe that our revenue retention rate provides insight into the quality of our products and services and the value that our products and services provide our clients.\nWe define revenue retention rate as the actual subscription revenue (dollar-based) recognized in a 12-month period from clients that existed on the day prior to the start of the 12-month period divided by our annualized subscription revenue as of the day prior to the start of the 12-month period. Our revenue retention rate was 92% for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nGross margin\nWe derive revenue through the sale of our enterprise software products and services. All the costs incurred in providing these products and services are recognized as part of the cost of revenue. The cost of revenue includes all direct product line expenses, as well as the expenses incurred by our shared services organization which supports all product lines.\nWe define gross profit as the difference between revenue and the costs incurred in providing the software products and services. Gross margin is the ratio of gross profit divided by revenue. Our gross margin was approximately 63.6%, 61.4% and 62.6% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe the gross margin provides an indication of how efficiently and effectively we are operating our business and serving our clients.\nFactors Affecting Our Operating Performance\nLitigation\nThe information from Item 3, Legal Proceedings and Item 1A, Risk Factors--Risks Related to Litigation- We and our Chief Executive Officer are involved in litigation with Oracle. An adverse outcome in the ongoing litigation could result in the payment of substantial damages and/or an injunction against certain of our business practices, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results,\u201d is incorporated by reference herein. For claims on which Oracle has prevailed or may prevail, we have been and could be required to pay substantial damages for our current or past business activities or be enjoined from certain business practices. Any of these outcomes could result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdoption of enterprise software products and services\nWe believe the existing market for independent enterprise software support services is underserved. We currently provide support services for IBM, Microsoft, SAP, Oracle and other enterprise software vendors' products. We also believe the existing market for our other enterprise software products and services is underserved, and that we have unique products and services that can meet client needs in the marketplace. For example, we provide the Rimini Street Advanced Database Security product in partnership with McAfee, a global leader in cybersecurity.\nWe also believe that our total addressable market for our enterprise software products and services is substantially larger than our current client base and the products and services we currently offer. As a result, we believe we have the opportunity to expand our global client base and to further increase adoption of our software products and services within and across existing clients. However, as the market for independent enterprise software support services as well as our other software products and services is still emerging, it is difficult for us to predict the timing of when and if widespread acceptance will occur.\nSales cycle\nWe sell our services to our clients primarily through our direct sales organization. Our sales cycle, depending on the product or service, typically ranges from six months to a year from when a prospective client is engaged. While we believe that there is a significant market opportunity for our enterprise software products and services, we often must educate prospective clients about the value of our products and services, which can result in lengthy and multiple sales cycles, particularly for larger prospective clients, as well as the incurrence of significant marketing expenses. Our typical sales cycle with a prospective client begins with the generation of a sales lead through trade shows, industry events, online marketing, media interviews and articles, inbound calls, outbound calls or client, analyst or other referral. The sales lead is followed by an assessment of the prospect's current software license contract terms, systems environment, products and releases being used, needs and objectives.\nThe variability in our sales cycle for replacement or supplemental software support services is impacted by whether software vendors are able to convince potential clients that they should renew their software maintenance with the existing vendor or procure or renew supplemental support services from the existing vendor, respectively. Another driver of our sales cycle variability is any announcement by a software vendor of their discontinuation, reduction or limitation of support services for a particular software product or release for which we continue to offer a competing support service. In addition, our sales cycle variability is impacted by vendor discounts provided by software companies to retain existing clients or attract potential clients. Finally, our litigation with Oracle can also drive sales cycle variability as clients oftentimes perform their own legal due diligence, which can lengthen the sales cycle.\nKey Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations\nRevenue. We currently derive nearly all of our revenue from subscription-based contracts for software services. Revenue from these contracts is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the applicable service period.\nCost of revenue. Cost of revenue includes salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expenses associated with our technical support and services organization, as well as allocated overhead and non-personnel expenses such as outside services, professional fees and travel-related expenses. Allocated overhead includes overhead costs for depreciation of equipment, facilities (consisting of leasehold improvements and rent) and technical operations (including costs for compensation of our personnel and costs associated with our infrastructure). We recognize expenses related to our technical support and services organization as they are incurred.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our sales, marketing and business development employees and executives, amortization expense associated with capitalized sales commissions, sales commissions that do not qualify for capitalization, travel related expenses, outside services and allocated overhead. Sales commissions are costs of obtaining customer contracts and are capitalized and then amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be 4 years.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our administrative, legal, human resources, finance and accounting employees and executives. These expenses also include non-employee expenses, such as travel-related expenses, outside services, legal, auditing and other professional fees, and general corporate expenses, along with an allocation of our general overhead expenses.\nImpairment charges related to operating lease right-of-use assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment exists for property and equipment and other long-lived assets if the carrying amounts of such assets exceed the estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets. Impairment for intangible software assets is based upon an assessment of net realizable value. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset, or asset group, exceeds its fair value.\nLitigation costs and related recoveries, net. Litigation costs consist of legal settlements, pre-judgment interest, and third-party professional fees to defend against litigation claims. In the past, we have had liability insurance policies where a portion of our defense costs and litigation judgments or settlements have been reimbursed under the terms of the policies. Such insurance recoveries were reflected as a reduction of litigation costs upon notification of approval for reimbursement by the insurance company. For legal expenses related to Rimini II litigation, the deferred settlement liability was reduced with a corresponding reduction of legal expenses when the costs were incurred.\nInterest expense. Interest expense is incurred under our Credit Facility and other debt obligations. The components of interest expense include the amount of interest payable in cash at the stated interest rate, interest that is payable in kind through additional borrowings, make-whole applicable premium, and accretion of debt discounts and issuance costs ( DDIC\u201d) using the effective interest method.\nGain (loss) from change in fair value of redeemable warrants. We have revised certain prior period amounts on the audited condensed consolidated financial statements to correct a misstatement with respect to improperly classifying certain warrants to purchase approximately 6.1 million shares of our Common Stock, at $11.50 per share (the GP Sponsor Private Placement Warrants\u201d) as equity instead of as a warrant liability that is adjusted through charges or credits to the income statement each quarter to reflect changes in the fair value of the warrants, under the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 815-40, Contracts in Entity's Own Equity. The changes in the fair value of the GP Sponsor Private Placement Warrants are recorded each period through October 29, 2021.\nOther expenses, net. Other expenses, net consists primarily of gains or losses on foreign currency transactions, write-off of deferred debt financing costs related to unsuccessful financings, and interest income.\nIncome taxes. The provision for income taxes is based on the amount of our taxable income and enacted federal, state and foreign tax rates, as adjusted for allowable credits and deductions. Our provision for income taxes consists primarily of foreign taxes for the periods presented, as our taxable income for U.S. federal and state purposes is offset by net operating losses. In addition, based on all available evidence, we determined that it was more likely than not that we could benefit from our deferred tax assets, resulting in a tax benefit of $62.3 million in the current period. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we considered whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In prior years, the domestic net deferred tax assets had been fully offset by a valuation allowance because of our lack of domestic earnings history.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nOur consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are presented below (in thousands): \n_____________________\n(1)Includes the portion of costs for information technology, security services and facilities costs that are allocated to cost of revenue. In our consolidated financial statements, such costs are allocated between cost of revenue, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses based primarily on relative headcount, except for facilities which is based on occupancy.\nRevenue. Revenue increased from $326.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $374.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $47.7 million or 15%. The vast majority of this increase was driven by a 14% increase in the average number of unique clients, as opposed to existing unique clients subscribing to additional services. On a regional basis, United States revenue grew from $191.4 million for fiscal 2020 to $199.8 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $8.4 million or 4%, while international revenue grew from $135.3 million for fiscal 2020 to $174.6 million for fiscal 2021, an increase of $39.3 million or 29%. Accelerated growth in our international business was driven by an increase in sales headcount primarily in Asia and Europe and an increase in marketing and advertising spend targeted for prospective clients outside the United States.\nCost of revenue. Total cost of revenue increased from $126.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $136.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $10.3 million or 8%. This increase was primarily due to additional support for the increasing number of clients that resulted in an increase in employee compensation and benefits of $11.1 million, an increase in all other costs of $1.4 million and an increase in allocated costs of $0.2 million. These cost increases were offset by a decrease in engineering consulting costs of $2.5 million.\nThe $11.1 million increase in cost of revenue attributable to employee compensation and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to (a) an increase in salaries, wages and benefit costs of $10.8 million due to a 16% increase in the average number of employees devoted to cost of revenue functions, annual pay increases, and increased bonus payouts. In addition, stock based compensation increased $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAs discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, in August 2018 Oracle obtained a permanent injunction from the District Court that prohibits us from using certain processes that could require us to incur additional labor costs to provide support for our clients as contracted. In September 2018, the Company filed a motion with the Court of Appeals, seeking a stay of the permanent injunction pending appeal and requesting a decision before the expiration of the temporary stay entered by the District Court. In November 2018, the Court of Appeals denied the Company's motion for a stay pending appeal of the injunction issued by the District Court without addressing the merits of the Company's appeal, and it confirmed the briefing schedule for the appeal. The briefing on our appeal to the Court of Appeals was completed in March 2019, and a hearing on our appeal occurred in July 2019. In August 2019, the Court of Appeals entered an order affirming the permanent injunction and the award of attorneys' fees that were previously paid to Oracle. However, the Court of Appeals agreed that the injunction was overbroad in two respects and instructed the District Court to remove the restriction on local hosting\u201d of J.D. Edwards and Siebel software and the prohibition against accessing\u201d J.D. Edwards and Siebel software source code. Since the date the temporary stay was lifted on the permanent injunction, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional expenses in the range of 1% to 2% of revenue for additional labor costs because, as drafted, the injunction contains language that could be read to cover some current support practices that are being litigated in the Rimini II\u201d lawsuit and that have not been found to be infringing.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased from $200.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $238.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $37.4 million or 19%. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 61.4% compared to 63.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $47.7 million or 15% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Total cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $10.3 million, or 8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Given that the increase in the cost of revenue was 8% compared to the increase in revenue of 15%, it resulted in a 220 basis points improvement in our gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The higher gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the decline in engineering consulting costs and small increase in our allocated costs.\nSales and marketing expenses. As a percentage of our revenue, sales and marketing expenses have decreased from 35% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 34% for the year ended December 31, 2021. In dollar terms, sales and marketing expenses increased from $114.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $128.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $13.8 million or 12%. This increase was primarily due to (i) a $15.8 million increase in employee compensation and benefits as a result of a 16% increase in average headcount, (ii) an increase in trade show costs of $1.7 million, (iii) an increase in recruitment costs of $0.7 million and (iv) an increase of all other costs of $0.6 million. These increases were offset by declines in advertising, marketing and promotion costs and travel expenses of $2.0 million, $0.8 million and $2.3 million, respectively.\nThe $15.8 million increase in sales and marketing expense attributable to employee compensation and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to an increase in (i) salaries, wages and benefit costs of $12.6 million due to a 16% increase in the average number of employees devoted to sales and marketing functions, annual pay increases, and higher\nbonus payouts and (ii) commissions of $3.2 million due to new customer wins in excess of the prior year. Our overall spending increased as we attempt to accelerate our future revenue growth by investing in more resources.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased from $52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $64.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $12.0 million or 23%. This increase was primarily due to (i) increases in compensation and benefit costs of $10.3 million, (ii) an increase in computer software and license costs of $1.2 million, (iii) an increase of travel expenses of $0.9 million, (iv) an increase in other taxes of $0.4 million and (v) an increase in recruitment costs of $0.2 million. These unfavorable variances were offset, in part, by (i) a reduction of contract labor of $1.1 million, (ii) a favorable increase in administrative allocations of $0.6 million and (iii) a reduction in rent of $0.4 million.\nThe $10.3 million increase in general and administrative expenses attributable to employee compensation and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2021, was primarily due to an increase in salaries, wages and benefit costs of $8.9 million due to a 12% increase in the average number of employees devoted to general and administrative functions, annual pay increases, and increased bonus payouts, and an increase of $1.4 million in stock-based compensation expense.\nWe expect to continue to incur higher expenses associated with supporting the growth of our business, both in terms of size and geographical diversity, and to meet the increased compliance requirements associated with being a public company. Public company costs that are expected to increase in the future include additional information systems costs, costs for additional personnel in our accounting, human resources, IT and legal functions, SEC and Nasdaq fees, and incremental professional, legal, audit and insurance costs. As a result, we currently expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in dollar terms in future periods.\nImpairment charges related to operating lease right-of-use assets. We recognized an impairment charge of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, related to two of our office leases as we ceased to use portions of our office space due to increased use of remote work which has occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLitigation costs and related recoveries, net. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, litigation costs and related recoveries, net consist of the following (in thousands): \nLitigation settlement expense increased from no expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Following nearly two years of discovery by Oracle, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to five of the items. With respect to the other five items, the District Court found the Company violated the permanent injunction, awarded sanctions to Oracle of $0.6 million and ordered that certain computer files be quarantined from use and notice and proof of such quarantining be provided to Oracle. The District Court also ruled that Oracle may recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. The Company has estimated those costs to be $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nProfessional fees and other defense costs associated with litigation increased from $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $3.0 million. This increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with discovery work on the Rimini II litigation and the Rimini I appeal during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInsurance costs and related recoveries, net decreased from a net cost of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to net benefit of $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized costs of $1.1 million to revise the amount due to the insurance company (for portions of the Court of Appeals and U.S. Supreme Court awards), which we paid in September 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we received insurance proceeds of $7.1 million related to our litigation costs incurred as part of the injunction proceedings. We are self-insured for any costs related to any current or future intellectual property litigation. We currently believe our cash on hand, accounts receivable and contractually committed backlog provides us with sufficient liquidity to cover costs related to our litigation with Oracle.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased from $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of $1.5 million. Interest expense increased primarily due to entering into a five-year Credit Facility for $90 million on July 20, 2021.\nLoss on change in fair value of redeemable warrants. Loss on change in fair value of redeemable warrants amounted to a loss of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a loss of $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The fair value per warrant changed from $0.35 per warrant as of December 31, 2020 to $1.04 per warrant as of October 29, 2021, which was the date whereby the GP Sponsor Warrants were determined to no longer be treated as a liability. The fair value per warrant changed from $0.12 as of December 31, 2019 compared to $0.35 as of December 31, 2020. The fair value per warrant changed was $0.76 per warrant as of December 31, 2018.\nOther expenses, net. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we had other expenses, net of $0.3 million as compared to other expenses net of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other expense, net was primarily comprised of foreign exchange losses of $0.1 million and other non-operating expenses of $0.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, other expense, net of $1.6 million was primarily comprised of foreign exchange losses of $1.4 million and other non-operating expenses of $0.2 million.\nIncome taxes. Income taxes went from an expense of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to a tax benefit of $55.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, a change of $60.4 million or (1,321)%. This was primarily the result of reducing our valuation allowance by $65.7 million as we determined that it was more likely than not that we could benefit from our deferred tax assets based on all of the available evidence.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a working capital deficit of $42.7 million and we had an accumulated deficit of $225.8 million. We recorded net income of $75.2 million and $11.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRedemption of Series A Preferred Stock\nOn July 20, 2021, we redeemed the remaining 87,802 shares of our 13.00% Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate total redemption price of $88.4 million. The total redemption price consisted of $87.8 million related to the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a face value of $1,000 per share and $0.6 million related to the dividends earned for the period from July 1, 2021 through July 19, 2021. The redeemed shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, along with the dividends, were recorded on the redemption date of July 20, 2021.\nWe funded the redemption with borrowings from a five year term loan of $90 million, which was entered into on July 20, 2021 (the Credit Facility\u201d). The Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.50% and contains certain financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a total leverage ratio, and a minimum liquidity of $20 million in U.S. cash. Annual minimum principal payments over the five year term for the Credit Facility will be 5%, 5%, 7.5%, 7.5%, and 10%, respectively, with the remaining balance due at the end of the term.\nOn April 16, 2021, we redeemed 60,000 shares of our 13.00% Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate total redemption price of $62.3 million. The total price consisted of $60.0 million related to the face value of $1,000 per share of Series A Preferred Stock and $2.3 million related to the dividends to be earned for the period from April 1, 2021 through July 18, 2021. The redeemed shares of Series A Preferred Stock, along with the dividends were recorded when the Series A Preferred Stock became manditorily redeemable on April 16, 2021.\nOn March 11, 2021, we completed the March 2021 Offering of 7.8 million shares of our Common Stock at a price of $7.75 per share for total gross proceeds of $57.0 million. Net proceeds from the March 2021 Offering were $55.6 million after underwriter and offering expenses. We used the net proceeds from the March 2021 Offering to redeem 60,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock.\nOn January 5, 2021, we entered into an agreement with certain of the holders of its Series A Preferred Stock (the January 2021 Stock Repurchase Agreement\u201d) to repurchase 10,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the associated obligations pursuant to our Convertible Secured Promissory Notes outstanding in respect thereof (the Note Obligations\u201d) for\nan aggregate purchase price of approximately $9.0 million representing a discount to the face value of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock and no make-whole payments were required.\nThe holders of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled to, from the respective issuance date, a cash dividend of 10.0% per annum and a payment-in-kind dividend of 3.0% per annum for the first five years following the initial June 2018 closing and thereafter all dividends accruing on such Series A Preferred Stock will be payable in cash at a rate of 13.0% per annum.\nCredit Facility\nEffective July 20, 2021, we received $89.3 million of net proceeds related to the Credit Facility. The borrowings under the Credit Facility were discounted at 0.375%. As part of the transaction, we incurred issuance costs of $4.2 million, which were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d), plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.50%. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the interest rate on the Credit Facility was 2.4%.\nThe Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio greater than 1.25, a total leverage ratio less than 3.75, and a minimum liquidity of $20 million in U.S. cash. Annual minimum principal payments over the five year term for the Credit Facility will be 5%, 5%, 7.5%, 7.5%, and 10%, respectively, with the remaining balance due at the end of the term. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company made principal payments of $2.3 million.\nPursuant to a Guaranty and Security Agreement, dated July 2, 2021 (the Guaranty and Security Agreement\u201d), among the Credit Parties and Capital One, National Association, as agent, the obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries (the Company and the guarantors, collectively, the Credit Parties\u201d) and are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and exceptions, by a lien on substantially all assets of the Credit Parties.\nRelated Party Note Payable to GP Sponsor\nUpon consummation of the merger with GP Investments Acquisition Corp. (\"GPIA\") in May 2017, an outstanding note payable to GP Sponsor with an initial face amount of approximately $3.0 million was assumed by the Company. This note was originally non-interest bearing and was not due and payable until the outstanding principal balance under the former Credit Facility was less than $95.0 million. At the inception of this note, the maturity date was expected to occur in June 2020 based on the scheduled principal payments under the Credit Facility. Interest was initially imputed under this note payable at the rate of 15.0% per annum. This note payable was amended twice in 2018, which resulted in further changes to the effective interest rate and maturity date.\nThe second amendment to the note payable was effective on December 21, 2018 and provided for an extension of the maturity date from January 4, 2019 to June 28, 2019. In addition, the parties agreed that the note payable would retroactively bear interest at 13.0% per annum from July 19, 2018 through the maturity date. Total retroactive interest amounted to $0.2 million which is accounted for as DDIC that was being accreted through the maturity date. We recognized accretion expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIn addition, the second amendment provided for monthly principal payments starting in December 2018 of approximately $0.4 million plus accrued interest. In December 2018, we made a payment of $0.6 million, primarily consisting of payment of retroactive interest of $0.2 million and the first monthly principal payment of $0.4 million. We made principal and interest payments totaling $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective interest rate for accretion of DDIC was 26.4% for the period from December 21, 2018 through June 28, 2019. The note was paid off on June 28, 2019.\nPlease refer to Notes 5 through 8 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for information regarding our Credit Facility, our Series A Preferred Stock and our Common Stock Offerings.\nA key component of our business model generally requires that customers prepay us annually for the services we will provide over the following year or longer. As a result, we collect cash from our customers in advance of when the related service costs are incurred, which resulted in deferred revenue of $253.2 million that is included in current liabilities as of December 31, 2021. Therefore, we believe that working capital deficit is not as meaningful in evaluating our liquidity since the costs of fulfilling our commitments to provide services to customers are currently limited to approximately 36% of the related deferred revenue based on our gross margin of 64% for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nFor the next 12 months, assuming that our operations are not significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $120.0 million as of December 31, 2021, plus future cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs including working capital requirements, planned capital expenditures, and our contractual obligations of approximately $12.8 million that are due during the 12 months ending December 31, 2022.\nAs discussed below in greater detail, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated cash flows from our operating activities of $66.9 million, which were derived from cash earnings of $37.4 million and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of $29.5 million. We believe our operating cash flows for the year ending December 31, 2021 will be sufficient to fund the portion of our contractual obligations that is not funded with existing capital resources.\nCash Flows Summary\nPresented below is a summary of our operating, investing and financing cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands): \nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nA key component of our business model generally requires that customers prepay us annually for the services we will provide over the following year or longer. As a result, we collect cash in advance of the date when the vast majority of the related services are provided. During 2020, we focused on our collection efforts as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged to minimize the unfavorable impact of our accounts receivable. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $66.9 million and $42.1 million, respectively. The key components in the calculation of our cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, are as follows (in thousands):\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $66.9 million. We recognized net income of $75.2 million, non-cash expenses resulting in a use of $37.8 million and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of $29.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For year ended December 31, 2021, the non-cash expenses, net amounted to a use of $37.8 million and were comprised of the following; stock-based compensation expense of $9.7 million, amortization and accretion related to ROU assets and liabilities of $6.1 million, a loss from change in in fair value of redeemable warrants of $4.2 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $2.4 million, a non-cash impairment charge related to a ROU asset of $1.6 million and a write-off of debt discounts and issuance costs of $0.4 million. These expenses were offset by a change in our deferred tax asset provision which amounted to a benefit of $62.3 million, related primarily to the reduction in our valuation allowance during 2021.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, changes in operating assets and liabilities were favorable by $29.5 million to the operating cash flows due to an increase of deferred revenue of $47.3 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses, deposits, accrued liabilities for $3.5 million and accounts payable of $2.5 million. These favorable changes were offset by unfavorable changes in accounts receivable for $18.8 million, prepaid expenses, deposits and other assets for $3.5 million and deferred contract costs for $1.6 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $42.1 million. We recognized net income of $11.6 million, non-cash expenses of $17.6 million and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. For year ended December 31, 2020, the non-cash expenses, net amounted to $17.6 million and were comprised of stock-based compensation expense of $7.5 million,\namortization and accretion related to ROU assets and liabilities of $6.2 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $1.8 million, a loss from change in in fair value of redeemable warrants of $1.4 million and a non-cash impairment charge related to a ROU asset of $1.2 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, changes in operating assets and liabilities were favorable by $13.0 million to the operating cash flows due to an increase of deferred revenue of $22.7 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses, deposits and other assets of $3.2 million, an increase in accrued liabilities of $1.6 million and an increase in accounts payable of $0.9 million. These favorable changes were offset by unfavorable changes in accounts receivable for $8.5 million and deferred contract costs for $6.9 million.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities were primarily driven by capital expenditures for leasehold improvements and computer equipment as we continued to invest in our business infrastructure and advance our geographic expansion. Such capital expenditures totaled $2.1 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, capital expenditures of $2.1 million consisted of new computer equipment and leasehold improvements of $1.1 million for our U.S. facilities, and $1.0 million for computer equipment at our foreign locations, primarily in India.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, capital expenditures of $1.5 million consisted of new computer equipment and leasehold improvements of $0.8 million for our U.S. facilities, and $0.7 million for computer equipment at our foreign locations, primarily in India.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cash utilized in financing activities of $26.6 million was attributable to payments to repurchase shares of Series A Preferred Stock totaling $156.8 million, which included $87.8 million in July 2021, $60.0 million in April 2021 and $9.0 million in January 2021; recurring dividend payments $9.7 million and a make-whole dividend payments of $2.9 million; payments related to debt issuance costs of $4.2 million; payments for professional fees associated with our March 2021 Offering of $1.3 million; principal payments related to the Credit Facility of $2.3 million; payments of $1.1 million related to treasury stock and capital lease payments of $0.4 million. These cash uses were offset by proceeds of $89.3 million from the new Credit Facility, proceeds of $57.0 million generated from the March 2021 Offering and proceeds of $5.9 million received from stock option exercises.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities of $6.4 million was attributable to net proceeds of $25.7 million generated from our August 2020 Offering and proceeds of $1.8 million received from stock option exercises. These cash proceeds were offset by dividend payments of $15.8 million, payments of $4.5 million related to repurchasing 5,000 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, payments for professional fees associated with our August 2020 Offering of $0.6 million and capital lease payments of $0.3 million.\nForeign Subsidiaries\nOur foreign subsidiaries and branches are dependent on our U.S.-based parent for continued funding. We currently do not intend to repatriate any amounts that have been invested overseas back to the U.S.-based parent. The imposition of the Transition Tax set forth in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 may reduce or eliminate U.S. federal deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. However, we may still be liable for withholding taxes, state taxes, or other income taxes that might be incurred upon the repatriation of foreign earnings. We have not made any provision for additional income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $51.3 million in our foreign subsidiaries.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations on an undiscounted basis as of December 31, 2021, and the period in which each contractual obligation is due (in thousands):\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWith respect to our significant accounting policies that are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, we believe that the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nIncome Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC 740\u201d). Significant judgment is required in determining income tax benefit or expense and in evaluating uncertainties under ASC 740. Deferred taxes are recorded for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Valuation allowances are established when it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company's deferred tax assets are primarily the result of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards ( NOLs\u201d) and tax credit carryforwards.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we released our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets and recognized a $55.8 million income tax benefit. Management determined that, as a result of generating pretax earnings, utilization of net operating loss carryovers and projected pre-tax earnings, there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that its U.S. deferred taxes are realizable. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible, prior to the expiration of the tax attributes. The evaluation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and forecasting future profitability.\nWe assessed the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize existing deferred tax assets within the applicable expiration period. While we believe that we have utilized a reasonable method to determine our deferred tax assets and the related release of our valuation allowance, should factors and\nconditions differ materially from those used by us, the actual realization of deferred tax assets could differ materially from the reported amounts.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If some amount within a range of probable loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of probable loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the range of the loss is estimable, then we disclose the range of the possible loss if the upper end of the range is material. If we cannot estimate the range of loss, we will disclose the reason why it cannot estimate the range of loss, if there is a reasonable possibility that the amount of loss may be material. We regularly evaluate current information available to it to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted and if a range of possible loss should be disclosed.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following accounting standards are not yet effective and management has not completed its evaluation of the recent accounting pronouncements to determine the impact that adoption of these standards will have on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-6, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). The guidance eliminates the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting for convertible instruments. The new guidance also modifies how particular convertible instruments and certain contracts that may be settled in cash or shares impact the diluted EPS computation. The new guidance is effective for us as of January 1, 2022. We are assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor additional information on recently issued and adopted accounting standards, please refer to

(RMNI), incorporated on October 10, 2017, and its predecessor Rimini Street, Inc. (RSI), incorporated in September 2005. RSI merged with GPIA, a SPAC, in 2017 to form the RMNI. The financial results presented reflect the combined operations of RSI and its subsidiaries.\n\nFor fiscal 2021, the report compares financial performance with fiscal 2020 (more detailed comparison with fiscal 2019 is available in the 2020 annual report filed with the SEC). It emphasizes that RMNI is a leading independent provider of enterprise software support services for Oracle and SAP products, with a broad client base that includes 72 Fortune 500 companies and 16 Fortune Global 100 companies.\n\nRegarding financial performance, RMNI generated revenue of $374.4 million in fiscal 2021, up 15% from 2020, primarily due to an increase in client numbers. The company earned a net income of $75.2 million in fiscal 2021. Revenue from the United States accounted for 53%, while international operations contributed 47%.\n\nInvestments in long-term growth are ongoing, and RMNI expects to continue investing in global marketing, sales, and product and service improvement. RMNI has an accumulated deficit of $225.8 million as of December 31, 2021, and does not anticipate profitability in the near future.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 was discussed, highlighting that RMNI successfully transitioned to remote operations without significant financial impact in 2021, while achieving cost savings. The future impact of the pandemic remains uncertain.\n\nAs part of recent developments, RMNI's Board approved a stock repurchase program, and the company completed significant transactions including a stock offering and the redemption of Series A Preferred Stock, which was funded by securing a Credit Facility.\n\nThe company\u2019s business model relies on subscription-based revenue tied to long-term contracts, with most invoicing occurring within non-cancelable periods. RMNI believes that its enterprise software support products and services represent a significant cost-saving opportunity for organizations seeking to redirect budgets towards new technology investments.\n\nFinancial condition discussions include an analysis of cash flows, liquidity, contractual obligations, off-balance sheet arrangements, and critical accounting policies. The report also notes that management is evaluating the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on future financial statements.\n\nSome important financial metrics for RMNI include the number of clients, annualized subscription revenue, revenue retention rate, and gross margin.\n\nLastly, the report discusses RMNI\u2019s considerations around income taxes, deferred tax assets, and loss contingencies, acknowledging areas of judgment and complexity in their accounting policies."}
