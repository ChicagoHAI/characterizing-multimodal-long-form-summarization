MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Carlyle Group L.P. (the Partnership\u201d) is a Delaware limited partnership formed on July 18, 2011. The Partnership is a holding partnership and its sole material assets are equity interests through wholly owned subsidiary entities representing partnership units in Carlyle Holdings I L.P., Carlyle Holdings II L.P. and Carlyle Holdings III L.P. (collectively,\u201d Carlyle Holdings\u201d). Through wholly owned subsidiary entities, the Partnership is the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings and operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Carlyle Holdings and, through Carlyle Holdings and its subsidiaries, continues to conduct the business now conducted by these subsidiaries. Carlyle Group Management L.L.C. is the general partner of the Partnership.\nAs the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings, the Partnership consolidates the financial position and results of operations of Carlyle Holdings into its financial statements, and the ownership interests of the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships are reflected as a non-controlling interest in the Partnership's financial statements.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe conduct our operations through four reportable segments: Corporate Private Equity, Global Market Strategies, Real Assets and Investment Solutions.\nTable 266: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Corporate Private Equity - Our Corporate Private Equity segment advises our 22 buyout and 10 growth capital funds, which seek a wide variety of investments of different sizes and growth potentials. As of December 31, 2015, our Corporate Private Equity segment had approximately $63 billion in AUM and approximately $41 billion in Fee-earning AUM.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 267: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Global Market Strategies - Our Global Market Strategies segment advises a group of 68 funds that pursue investment opportunities across structured credit, distressed debt, corporate and energy mezzanine debt, middle-market and senior debt, as well as credit, emerging markets and commodities-focused hedge funds and a mutual fund. As of December 31, 2015, our Global Market Strategies segment had approximately $35 billion in AUM and approximately $31 billion in Fee-earning AUM.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 268: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Real Assets - Our Real Assets segment advises our eight U.S. and internationally focused real estate funds, our infrastructure fund, our two power funds, our international energy fund, as well as our five Legacy Energy funds (funds that we jointly advise with Riverstone). The segment also includes six NGP management fee funds and three carry funds advised by NGP. As of December 31, 2015, our Real Assets segment had approximately $38 billion in AUM and approximately $31 billion in Fee-earning AUM.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 269: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Investment Solutions - Our Investment Solutions segment advises a global private equity fund of funds program and related co-investment and secondary activities across 118 fund of funds vehicles. As of December 31, 2015, our Investment Solutions segment had approximately $46 billion in AUM and approximately $28 billion in Fee-earning AUM.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds. We also typically receive a performance fee from an investment fund, which may be either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income, which we refer to as a carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), we are required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we advise. However, for segment reporting purposes, we present revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these investment funds. Accordingly, our segment revenues primarily consist of fund management and related advisory fees, performance fees (consisting of incentive fees and carried interest allocations), investment income, including realized and unrealized gains on our investments in our funds and other trading securities, as well as interest and other income. Our segment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits expenses, including salaries, bonuses, performance payment arrangements, and equity-based compensation excluding awards granted in our initial public offering or in connection with acquisitions and strategic investments, and general and administrative expenses. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the differences between our financial results reported pursuant to U.S. GAAP and our financial results for segment reporting purposes.\nTrends Affecting our Business\nOur results of operations, particularly our quarterly results, are affected by a variety of factors, including global economic, market and financial conditions, particularly in the United States, Europe and Asia. In general, a climate of stable interest rates and liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provides a positive environment for us to invest, develop and exit investments in our carry funds at attractive returns. Periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets also can present us with significant opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future revenue growth. For our hedge funds, opportunities to generate revenue depend on their respective investment strategies, certain of which may benefit from higher market volatility, including strategies targeted at capitalizing on low levels of correlation in equity and debt markets, differences in market prices versus fundamental value and trading inefficiencies. While our business is subject to global economic and market factors, we believe that our diversified, multi-product global platform, which invests across numerous industries, asset classes and geographies, enhances the stability of our management fee revenues and distributable earnings over the long term. Our diversified platform mitigates our exposure to a negative event associated with any specific fund, investment or vintage. Whether in stable or more volatile economic conditions, of critical importance to the success of our investments is the quality of our management teams as they actively work to monitor shifts in economic conditions and their impact on our investments.\nThe increase in financial market volatility observed over the course of 2015 and into the beginning of 2016 generally is attributable to three primary and interrelated factors: concerns regarding the economic climate in China, crude oil prices and the availability of credit. In China, there has been a significant slowdown in the industrial sector. As China accounts for nearly 25% of global manufacturing output and is a key link in global supply chains, a slowdown in China's industrial sector has a direct negative impact on global industrial orders. At the same time, the decline in Chinese demand for industrial inputs has contributed to a reduction in the capital spending of global businesses operating in the energy, metals, and mining industries because low commodity prices generally do not support new capital investment in businesses in these industries. The industrial sector of the U.S. economy is also contracting as a result of the significant reduction in energy-related capital spending. In January 2016, the Federal Reserve announced that its industrial production index declined by 0.4% in December, resulting in a full-year decline of 1.8%, the first 12-month decline in U.S. industrial output since 2009. Energy accounted for 70% of U.S. net industrial investment between 2009 and 2014 so with energy-related orders falling by 30%, many manufacturers are reporting their worst numbers since 2009.\nThe uncertainty around crude oil prices has also contributed to the increasingly uncertain investment environment and has had spillover effects across the chain of energy production, transmission, storage and consumption and has also affected the credit markets. Losses on energy related credit transactions have caused lenders, particularly in the U.S., to exercise caution in extending credit in all sectors, which has caused a tightening of credit availability for our transactions. We have not seen the same level of credit contraction in Europe and Asia and have remained quite active in those markets. In 2015, our European buyout and growth funds invested $1.0 billion in 14 transactions and our Asia buyout and growth funds and Japan buyout funds invested $1.4 billion in 13 transactions and closed 4 initial public offerings. As of December 31, 2015, we had capital available for investment through our carry funds of $44 billion. In 2015, we invested approximately $8.8 billion in new and existing investments across our carry fund portfolio, which is slightly less than our average over the last five years of $9.5 billion. Given increased competition for investments, and the effect, particularly in Europe and Asia, of the strong dollar against foreign currencies, the internal rates of return we are able to generate may be lower than our historical rates, but we continue to follow our core investment tenets and disciplined approach to make investments where we believe we can create value and achieve appreciation. We have a long-term investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year.\nThe confluence of effects from economic conditions in China, crude prices and tightening credit markets and the resulting market volatility, particularly at the beginning of 2016, also negatively impacted the value of our public portfolio, which accounts for approximately 26% of our total carry fund portfolio as of December 31, 2015. While changing valuations do not have a cash impact on our business until the investment is realized, they are reflected in the quarterly valuations of our portfolio and can adversely impact our quarterly GAAP earnings. Volatility and the corresponding heightened market uncertainty may also impact our ability to execute block trades and pursue initial public offerings as an exit strategy for our privately held portfolio companies. However, while in 2015 global IPO issuances were down 47% year-over-year on a proceeds basis and were at the lowest levels since 2009, our funds completed seven initial public offerings in 2015 as compared to six in 2014.\nRecent Transactions\nIn February 2016, the Board of Directors of our general partner declared a distribution of $0.29 per common unit to common unitholders in respect of the fourth quarter of 2015 payable on March 2, 2016 to holders of record of common units at the close of business on February 23, 2016.\nIn February 2016, the Board of Directors of the general partner of the Partnership authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of common units and/or Carlyle Holdings units. Under this unit repurchase program, units may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. We expect that the majority of repurchases under this program will be done via open market transactions. No units will be repurchased from our executive officers under this program. The timing and actual number of common units and/or Carlyle Holdings units repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price, and economic and market conditions. This unit repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date.\nKey Financial Measures\nOur key financial measures are discussed in the following pages.\nRevenues\nRevenues primarily consist of fund management fees, performance fees, investment income, including realized and unrealized gains of our investments in our funds and other trading securities, as well as interest and other income. See - Critical Accounting Policies - Performance Fees\u201d and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the manner in which management fees and performance fees are generated.\nFund Management Fees. Fund management fees include (i) management fees and (ii) transaction and portfolio advisory fees. Management fees are fees we earn for advisory services we provide to funds in which we hold a general partner interest or with which we have an investment advisory or investment management agreement. Management fees are based on (a) third parties' capital commitments to our investment funds, (b) third parties' remaining capital invested in our investment funds at cost or at the lower of cost or aggregate remaining fair value, (c) gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, (d) for the private equity and real estate fund of funds vehicles following the expiration of the commitment period or weighted-average investment period of such vehicles, the lower of cost or fair value of the capital invested, the net asset value for unrealized investments, or the contributions for unrealized investments, (e) the total par amount of assets for our CLOs and the aggregate principal amount of the notes of our other structured products, or (f) the net asset value ( NAV\u201d) of certain of our investment funds, as described in our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, management fees include catch-up management fees, which are episodic in nature and represent management fees charged to fund investors in subsequent closings of a fund which apply to the time period between the fee initiation date and the subsequent closing date.\nManagement fees for funds in our corporate private equity funds, closed-end carry funds in the global market strategies segment and real assets funds generally range from 1% to 2% of commitments during the investment period of the relevant fund. Large funds tend to have lower effective management fee rates, while smaller funds tend to have effective management fee rates approaching 2.0%. Following the expiration or termination of the investment period of such funds, the management fees generally step-down to between 0.6% and 2.0% generally on the lower of cost or fair value of capital invested; however, certain of our managed accounts base management fees at all times on contributions for unrealized investments or the current value of the investment. Depending upon the contracted terms of investment advisory or investment management and related agreements, these fees are called semiannually in advance and are recognized as earned over the subsequent six month period. As a result, cash on hand and deferred revenue will generally be higher at or around January and July, which are the semiannual due dates for management fees.\nManagement fees for our private equity and real estate fund of funds vehicles generally range from 0.3% to 1.0% on the vehicle's capital commitments during the commitment fee period of the relevant fund or the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds. Following the expiration of the commitment fee period or weighted-average investment period of such funds, the management fees generally range from 0.3% to 1.0% on the lower of cost or fair value of the capital invested, the NAV for unrealized investments, or the contributions for unrealized investments. The management fees for our fund of hedge funds vehicles generally range 0.2% to 1.5% of NAV. Management fees for our Investment Solutions segment are generally due quarterly and are recognized over the related quarter.\nOur hedge funds generally pay management fees quarterly that range from 1.5% to 2.0% of NAV per year. Management fees for our business development companies are due quarterly in arrears at annual rates that range from 0.25% to 1.0% of gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents. Management fees for our CLOs and other structured products typically range from 0.15% to 1.0% on the total par amount of assets or the aggregate principal amount of the notes in the CLO and are due quarterly or semiannually based on the terms and recognized over the relevant period. Our management fees for our CLOs/structured products and credit opportunities funds are governed by indentures and collateral management agreements.\nWith respect to Claren Road and ESG, we retain a specified percentage of the management fees of the businesses based on our economic ownership in the management companies of 55%. Through the second quarter of 2015, we retained 55% of the management fees of Carlyle Commodity Management L.L.C. ( CCM\u201d or Carlyle Commodity Management\u201d, formerly Vermillion) based on our 55% economic interest in Carlyle Commodity Management. Effective July 1, 2015, based on a restructuring of the original acquisition agreements of Carlyle Commodity Management, in which the Partnership's economic interest increased to approximately 83%, we are entitled to approximately 83% of the management fees of Carlyle Commodity Management. Management fees are not subject to repayment but may be offset to the extent that other fees are earned as described below under -Transaction and Portfolio Advisory Fee.\u201d\nManagement fees attributable to Carlyle Partners VI, L.P. ( CP VI\u201d), our sixth U.S. buyout fund with approximately $12.0 billion of Fee-earning AUM as of December 31, 2015, were approximately 15% and 14% of total management fees recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management fees attributable to Carlyle Partners V, L.P. ( CP V\u201d), our fifth U.S. buyout fund, were approximately 11% of total management fees recognized during the year ended December 31, 2013. No other fund generated over 10% of total management fees in the periods presented.\nFund management fees exclude the reimbursement of any partnership expenses paid by the Partnership on behalf of the Carlyle funds pursuant to the limited partnership agreements, including amounts related to the pursuit of actual, proposed, or unconsummated investments, professional fees, expenses associated with the acquisition, holding and disposition of investments, and other fund administrative expenses.\nTransaction and Portfolio Advisory Fees. Transaction and portfolio advisory fees are fees we receive for the transaction and portfolio advisory services we provide to our portfolio companies. When covered by separate contractual agreements, we recognize transaction and portfolio advisory fees for these services when the service has been provided and collection is reasonably assured. We are required to offset our fund management fees earned by a percentage of the transaction and advisory fees earned, which we refer to as the rebate offsets.\u201d Such rebate offset percentages generally approximate 80% of the fund's portion of the transaction and advisory fees earned. The recognition of portfolio advisory fees and transaction fees can be volatile as they are primarily generated by investment activity within our funds, and therefore are impacted by our investment pace. We have received and expect to continue to receive requests from a variety of investors and groups representing investors to increase the percentage of transaction and advisory fees we share with our investors in future funds; to the extent that we accommodate such requests on future funds, the rebate offset percentages would increase relative to historical levels.\nPerformance Fees. Performance fees consist principally of the special residual allocation of profits to which we are entitled, commonly referred to as carried interest, from certain of our investment funds, which we refer to as the carry funds.\u201d We are generally entitled to a 20% allocation (or 10% to 20% on external coinvestment vehicles, with some earning no carried interest, or approximately 2% to 10% in the case of most of our fund of funds vehicles) of the net realized income or gain as a carried interest after returning the invested capital, the allocation of preferred returns of generally 8% to 9% and the return of certain fund costs (subject to catch-up provisions as set forth in the fund limited partnership agreement). Carried interest revenue, which is a component of performance fees in our consolidated financial statements, is recognized by Carlyle upon appreciation of the valuation of our funds' investments above certain return hurdles as set forth in each respective partnership agreement and is based on the amount that would be due to us pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were liquidated at such date. Accordingly, the amount of carried interest recognized as performance fees reflects our share of the fair value gains and losses of the associated funds' underlying investments measured at their then-current fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. As a result, the performance fees earned in an applicable reporting period are not indicative of any future period, as fair values are based on conditions prevalent as of the reporting date. Refer to - Trends Affecting our Business\u201d for further discussion. Carried interest is ultimately realized and distributed when: (i) an underlying investment is profitably disposed of, (ii) certain costs borne by the limited partner investors have been reimbursed, (iii) the investment fund's cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return and (iv) we have decided to collect carry rather than return additional capital to limited partner investors. Our decision to realize carry considers such factors as the level of embedded valuation gains, the portion of the fund invested, the portion of the fund returned to limited partner investors, and the length of time the fund has been in carry, as well as other qualitative measures. The portion of performance fees that are realized and unrealized in each period are separately reported in our statement of operations.\nUnder our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of AlpInvest, we generally do not retain any carried interest in respect of the historical investments and commitments to our fund of funds vehicles that existed as of July 1, 2011 (including any options to increase any such commitments exercised after such date). We are entitled to 15% of the carried interest in respect of commitments from the historical owners of AlpInvest for the period between 2011 and 2020 and 40% of the carried interest in respect of all other commitments (including all future commitments from third parties). In certain instances, carried interest associated with the fund of funds vehicles is subject to entity level income taxes in the Netherlands.\nOur performance fees are generated by a diverse set of funds with different vintages, geographic concentration, investment strategies and industry specialties. For an explanation of the fund acronyms used throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section, see Item 1. Business - Our Family of Funds.\u201d\nPerformance fees from Carlyle Europe Partners III, L.P. ( CEP III\u201d), Carlyle Asia Partners III ( CAP III\u201d), Carlyle Realty Partners VI, L.P. ( CRP VI\u201d), and Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy and Power Fund III, L.P. ( Energy III\u201d) (with total AUM of approximately $4.9 billion, $2.4 billion, $2.9 billion, and $0.5 billion, respectively) were $236.8 million, $184.5 million, $101.1 million, and $(100.3) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Performance fees from CP V and CEP III were $600.8 million and $584.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Performance fees from CP V, CEP III, and Carlyle Partners IV, L.P. ( CP IV\u201d), our fourth U.S. buyout fund, were $592.0 million, $509.1 million, and $390.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013. No other fund generated over 10% of performance fees in the periods presented.\nRealized carried interest may be clawed-back or given back to the fund if the fund's investment values decline below certain return hurdles, which vary from fund to fund. When the fair value of a fund's investments remains constant or falls below certain return hurdles, previously recognized performance fees are reversed. In all cases, each investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback obligations. For any given period, carried interest income could thus be negative; however, cumulative performance fees can never be negative over the life of a fund. In addition, we are not obligated to pay guaranteed returns or hurdles. If upon a hypothetical liquidation of a fund's investments at the then-current fair values, previously recognized and distributed carried interest would be required to be returned, a liability is established in our financial statements for the potential giveback obligation. As discussed below, each individual recipient of realized carried interest typically signs a guarantee agreement or partnership agreement that personally obligates such person to\nreturn his/her pro rata share of any amounts of realized carried interest previously distributed that are later clawed back. Accordingly, carried interest as performance fee compensation is subject to return to the Partnership in the event a giveback obligation is funded. Generally, the actual giveback liability, if any, does not become due until the end of a fund's life.\nIn addition to the carried interest from our carry funds, we are also entitled to receive incentive fees or allocations from certain of our Global Market Strategies funds when the return on AUM exceeds previous calendar-year ending or date-of-investment high-water marks. Our hedge funds generally pay annual incentive fees or allocations equal to 20% of the fund's profits for the year, subject to a high-water mark. The high-water mark is the highest historical NAV attributable to a fund investor's account on which incentive fees were paid and means that we will not earn incentive fees with respect to such fund investor for a year if the NAV of such investor's account at the end of the year is lower that year than any prior year-end NAV or the NAV at the date of such fund investor's investment, generally excluding any contributions and redemptions for purposes of calculating NAV. In these arrangements, incentive fees are recognized when the performance benchmark has been achieved based on the hedge funds' then-current fair value and are included in performance fees in our consolidated statements of operations. These incentive fees are a component of performance fees in our consolidated financial statements and are treated as accrued until paid to us.\nFor any given period, performance fee revenue on our statement of operations may include reversals of previously recognized performance fees due to a decrease in the value of a particular fund that results in a decrease of cumulative performance fees earned to date. Since fund return hurdles are cumulative, previously recognized performance fees also may be reversed in a period of appreciation that is lower than the particular fund's hurdle rate. For the years ended December 31, 2015 2014, and 2013, the reversals of performance fees were $253.4 million, $255.4 million, and $63.0 million, respectively.\nAdditionally, unrealized performance fees reverse when performance fees are realized and can be negative if the amount of realized performance fees exceed total performance fees generated in the period.\nAs of December 31, 2015, accrued performance fees and accrued giveback obligations were approximately $3.0 billion and $252.0 million, respectively, after amounts eliminated related to the Consolidated Funds. Each balance assumes a hypothetical liquidation of the funds' investments at December 31, 2015 at their then current fair values. These assets and liabilities will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the fair values of the fund investments until they are realized.\nIn addition, realized performance fees may be reversed in future periods to the extent that such amounts become subject to a giveback obligation. If at December 31, 2015, all investments held by our carry funds were deemed worthless, the amount of realized and previously distributed performance fees subject to potential giveback would be approximately $1.9 billion, on an after-tax basis where applicable. See the related discussion of Contingent Obligations (Giveback)\u201d within - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Since Carlyle's inception, we have repaid a total of approximately $53.9 million in\naggregate giveback obligations, which was funded primarily through collection of employee receivables related to giveback obligations and from non-controlling interests for their portion of the obligation.\nAs described above, each investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback obligations. As a result, performance fees within funds will continue to fluctuate primarily due to certain investments within each fund constituting a material portion of the carry in that fund. Additionally, the fair value of investments in our funds may have substantial fluctuations from period to period.\nIn addition, in our discussion of our non-GAAP results, we use the term net performance fees\u201d to refer to the performance fees from our funds net of the portion allocated to our investment professionals and certain tax expenses associated with carried interest attributable to certain partners and employees, which are reflected as performance fee related compensation expense. We use the term realized net performance fees\u201d to refer to realized performance fees from our funds, net of the portion allocated to our investment professionals and certain tax expenses associated with carried interest attributable to certain partners and employees, which are reflected as realized performance fee related compensation expense. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for the amount of realized and unrealized performance fees recognized each period. See - Segment Analysis\u201d for the realized and unrealized performance fees by segment and related discussion for each period.\nFair Value Measurement. U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which ranks the observability of market price inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices, or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets, will generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.\nFinancial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:\nLevel I - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical instruments as of the reporting date. The type of financial instruments included in Level I include unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in active markets. We do not adjust the quoted price for these instruments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.\nLevel II - inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. The type of financial instruments in this category includes less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs. Investments in hedge funds are classified in this category when their net asset value is redeemable without significant restriction.\nLevel III - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments that are included in this category include investments in privately-held entities, non-investment grade residual interests in securitizations, collateralized loan obligations, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs. Investments in fund of funds are generally included in this category.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the determination of which category within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate for any given financial instrument is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.\nThe table below summarizes the valuation of investments and other financial instruments included within our AUM, by segment and fair value hierarchy levels, as of December 31, 2015 (amounts in millions):\nTable 270: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Corporate\nPrivate\nEquity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Global\nMarket\nStrategies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Real Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment\nSolutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Results\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level I\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level II\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level III\n</td> <td>27,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Fair Value\n</td> <td>35,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Net Asset Value\n</td> <td>3,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(498\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(804\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total AUM, Excluding Available Capital Commitments\n</td> <td>38,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available Capital Commitments\n</td> <td>24,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total AUM\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn certain cases, debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices, market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments.\nInvestment professionals with responsibility for the underlying investments are responsible for preparing the investment valuations pursuant to the policies, methodologies and templates prepared by our valuation group, which is a team made up of dedicated valuation professionals reporting to our chief accounting officer. The valuation group is responsible for maintaining our valuation policy and related guidance, templates and systems that are designed to be consistent with the guidance found in U.S. GAAP. These valuations, inputs and preliminary conclusions are reviewed by the fund accounting teams. The valuations are then reviewed and approved by the respective fund valuation subcommittees, which are comprised of the respective fund head(s), segment head, chief financial officer and chief accounting officer, as well as members from the valuation group. The valuation group compiles the aggregate results and significant matters and presents them for review and approval by the global valuation committee, which is comprised of our co-chief executive officers, president and chief operating officer, chief risk officer, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer, deputy chief investment officers for Corporate Private Equity, the business segment heads, and observed by the chief compliance officer, the director of internal audit, and our audit committee. Additionally, each quarter a sample of valuations is reviewed by external valuation firms.\nIn the absence of observable market prices, we value our investments using valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis. For some investments little market activity may exist. Management's determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks. Investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity of operating companies and real estate properties, and certain debt positions. The valuation technique for each of these investments is described in Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment Income, Interest, and Other Income. Investment income, interest, and other income represent the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our principal investments, including our investments in Carlyle funds that are not consolidated, our equity method investments and other principal investments, as well as any interest and other income. Investment income (loss) also includes the related amortization of the basis difference between the carrying value of our investment and our share of the underlying net assets of the investee, as well as the compensation expense associated with compensatory arrangements provided by us to employees of our equity method investee. Realized investment income (loss) is recorded when we redeem all or a portion of our investment or when we receive or are due cash income, such as dividends or distributions. A realized investment loss is also recorded when an investment is deemed to be worthless. Unrealized investment income (loss) results from changes in the fair value of the underlying investment, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains (losses) at the time an investment is realized.\nInterest and Other Income of Consolidated Funds. Interest and other income of Consolidated Funds primarily represents the interest earned on CLO assets. However, the Consolidated Funds are not the same entities in all periods presented and may change in future periods due to changes in U.S. GAAP, changes in fund terms and terminations of funds.\nRevenue of a Consolidated Real Estate VIE. Revenue of a consolidated real estate VIE consists of revenue generated by Urbplan, which primarily is revenue earned for land development services using the completed contract method and investment income earned on Urbplan's investments. Under the completed contract method of revenue recognition, revenue is not recognized until the period in which the land development services contract is completed.\nNet Investment Gains (Losses) of Consolidated Funds. Net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds measures the change in the difference in fair value between the assets and the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds. A gain (loss) indicates that the fair value of the assets of the Consolidated Funds appreciated more (less), or depreciated less (more), than the fair value of the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds. A gain or loss is not necessarily indicative of the investment performance of the Consolidated Funds and does not impact the management or incentive fees received by Carlyle for its management of the Consolidated Funds. The portion of the net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds attributable to the limited partner investors is allocated to non-controlling interests. Therefore a gain or loss is not expected to have a material impact on the revenues or profitability of the Partnership. Moreover, although the assets of the Consolidated Funds are consolidated onto our balance sheet pursuant to U.S. GAAP, ultimately we do not have recourse to such assets and such liabilities are generally non-recourse to us. Therefore, a gain or loss from the Consolidated Funds generally does not impact the assets available to our equity holders.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation includes salaries, bonuses, equity-based compensation, and performance payment arrangements. Bonuses are accrued over the service period to which they relate.\nWe recognize as compensation expense the portion of performance fees that are due to our employees, senior Carlyle professionals, and advisors in a manner consistent with how we recognize the performance fee revenue. These amounts are accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction with the related performance fee revenue and, until paid, are recognized as a component of the accrued compensation and benefits liability. Compensation in respect of performance fees is paid when the related performance fees are realized, and not when such performance fees are accrued. The funds do not have a uniform allocation of performance fees to our employees, senior Carlyle professionals and advisors. Therefore, for any given period, the ratio of performance fee compensation to performance fee revenue may vary based on the funds generating the performance fee revenue for that period and their particular allocation percentages.\nIn addition, we have implemented various equity-based compensation arrangements that require senior Carlyle professionals and other employees to vest ownership of a portion of their equity interests over a service period of up to 42 months, which under U.S. GAAP will result in compensation charges over current and future periods. Further, in order to recruit and retain existing and future senior Carlyle professionals and other employees, we have implemented additional equity-based compensation programs that have resulted in increases to our equity-based compensation expenses, which is a trend that may continue in the future if we increase the use of deferred restricted common units. For example, in February 2016, we granted approximately 5 million deferred restricted common units across a significant number of our employees for a total estimated grant-date fair value of approximately $58 million; these awards vest over a period of 18 to 42 months. Compensation charges associated with the equity-based compensation grants issued in our initial public offering in May 2012 or grants issued in acquisitions or strategic investments are excluded from our calculation of Economic Net Income. Compensation charges associated with all equity-based compensation grants are excluded from Fee Related Earnings and Distributable Earnings.\nWe may hire additional individuals and overall compensation levels may correspondingly increase, which could result in an increase in compensation and benefits expense. As a result of acquisitions, we have charges associated with contingent consideration taking the form of earn-outs and profit participation, some of which are reflected as compensation expense. Our fundraising has increased in recent periods and, as a result, our compensation expense increased in periods in which we closed on increased levels of new capital commitments. Amounts due to employees related to such fundraising will be expensed when earned even though the benefit of the new capital and related fees will be reflected in operations over the life of the related fund.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General, administrative, and other expenses include occupancy and equipment expenses and other expenses, which consist principally of professional fees, including those related to our global regulatory compliance program, external costs of fundraising, travel and related expenses, communications and information\nservices, depreciation and amortization (including intangible asset amortization and impairment) and foreign currency transactions. We expect that general, administrative and other expenses will vary due to infrequently occurring or unusual items. Over the last three years, our general, administrative and other expenses have been relatively consistent but for the impairment of intangible assets and expenses associated with litigation matters. Also, in periods of significant fundraising, to the extent that we use third parties to assist in our fundraising efforts, our general, administrative and other expenses may increase accordingly. Additionally, we anticipate that general, administrative and other expenses will fluctuate from period to period due to the impact of foreign exchange transactions.\nWe also could incur additional expenses in the future related to our acquisitions including amortization of acquired intangibles, earn-outs to equity holders and fair value adjustments on contingent consideration issued, as well as related to our global compliance efforts. As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, we evaluate our intangible assets (including goodwill) for impairment and could record additional impairment losses in future periods.\nInterest and Other Expenses of Consolidated Funds. The interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds consist primarily of interest expenses related primarily to our CLO loans, professional fees and other third-party expenses.\nInterest and Other Expenses of a Consolidated Real Estate VIE. Interest and other expenses of a consolidated real estate VIE reflect expenses incurred by Urbplan, consisting primarily of interest expense, general and administrative expenses, compensation and benefits, and costs associated with land development services. Also included in this caption is the change in our estimate of the fair value of Urbplan's loans payable during the period.\nIncome Taxes. The Carlyle Holdings partnerships and their subsidiaries primarily operate as pass-through entities for U.S. income tax purposes and record a provision for state and local income taxes for certain entities based on applicable laws and a provision for foreign income taxes for certain foreign entities. In addition, Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. is subject to additional entity-level taxes that are reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome taxes for foreign entities are accounted for using the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period in which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by federal and certain state, local and foreign tax regulators. As of December 31, 2015, our U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2012 through 2014 are open under the normal three-year statute of limitations and therefore subject to examination. State and local tax returns are generally subject to audit from 2011 to 2014. Foreign tax returns are generally subject to audit from 2008 to 2014. Certain of our affiliates are currently under audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.\nNon-controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities. Non-controlling interests in consolidated entities represent the component of equity in consolidated entities not held by us. These interests are adjusted for general partner allocations and by subscriptions and redemptions in hedge funds which occur during the reporting period. Non-controlling interests related to hedge funds are subject to quarterly or monthly redemption by investors in these funds following the expiration of a specified period of time or may be withdrawn subject to a redemption fee in the hedge funds during the period when capital may not be withdrawn. As limited partners in these types of funds have been granted redemption rights, amounts relating to third-party interests in such consolidated funds are presented as redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities within the consolidated balance sheets. When redeemable amounts become legally payable to investors, they are classified as a liability and included in other liabilities of Consolidated Funds in the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe record significant non-controlling interests in Carlyle Holdings relating to the ownership interests of the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. The Partnership, through wholly owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings. Accordingly, the Partnership consolidates the financial position and results of operations of Carlyle Holdings into its financial statements, and the other ownership interests in Carlyle Holdings are reflected as a non-controlling interest in the Partnership's financial statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEconomic Net Income. Economic net income or ENI,\u201d is a key performance benchmark used in our industry. ENI represents segment net income which includes certain tax expense associated with performance fee compensation and excludes the impact of all other income taxes, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, acquisition-related items including amortization and any impairment charges of acquired intangibles and contingent consideration taking the form of earn-outs, charges associated with equity-based compensation grants issued in May 2012 upon completion of the initial public offering or grants issued in acquisitions or strategic investments, corporate actions and infrequently occurring or unusual events. We believe the inclusion or exclusion of these items provides investors with a meaningful indication of our core operating performance. For segment reporting purposes, revenues and expenses, and accordingly segment net income, are presented on a basis that deconsolidates the Consolidated Funds. Total Segment ENI equals the aggregate of ENI for all segments. This measure supplements and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed further under Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nFee Related Earnings. Fee Related Earnings is a component of Economic Net Income and measures our operating profitability exclusive of performance fees, investment income from investments in our funds, performance fee-related compensation, equity-based compensation expense, and certain general, administrative and other expenses when the timing of any future payment is uncertain. Accordingly, Fee Related Earnings reflect the ability of the business to cover direct base compensation and operating expenses from fee revenues other than performance fees. Fee Related Earnings are reported as part of our segment results. We use Fee Related Earnings from operations to measure our profitability from fund management fees.\nDistributable Earnings. Distributable Earnings is FRE plus realized net performance fees and realized investment income. Distributable Earnings is intended to show the amount of net realized earnings without the effects of consolidation of the Consolidated Funds. Distributable Earnings is derived from our segment reported results and is an additional measure to assess performance and amounts potentially available for distribution from Carlyle Holdings to its unitholders. Distributable Earnings is evaluated regularly by management in making resource deployment decisions and in assessing performance of our four segments and for compensation. We believe that reporting Distributable Earnings is helpful to understanding our business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure that management uses to analyze our segment performance.\nOperating Metrics\nWe monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the alternative asset management industry.\nFee-earning Assets under Management\nFee-earning assets under management or Fee-earning AUM refers to the assets we manage or advise from which we derive recurring fund management fees. Our Fee-earning AUM generally equals the sum of:\nTable 271: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>for substantially all carry funds and certain co-investment vehicles where the original investment period has not expired, and for Metropolitan fund of funds vehicles during the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds, the amount of limited partner capital commitments, and for AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles, the amount of external investor capital commitments during the commitment fee period, and for the NGP management fee funds and certain carry funds advised by NGP, the amount of investor capital commitments before the first investment realization (see Fee-earning AUM based on capital commitments\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>for substantially all carry funds and certain co-investment vehicles where the original investment period has expired and for Metropolitan fund of funds vehicles after the expiration of the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds, the remaining amount of limited partner invested capital at cost, and for the NGP management fee funds and certain carry funds advised by NGP where the first investment has been realized, the amount of partner commitments less realized and written-off investments (see Fee-earning AUM based on invested capital\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 273: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(c)\n</td> <td>the amount of aggregate fee-earning collateral balance at par of our collateralized loan obligations ( CLOs\u201d), as defined in the fund indentures (typically exclusive of equities and defaulted positions) as of the quarterly cut-off date for each CLO, and the aggregate principal amount of the notes of our other structured products (see Fee-earning AUM based on collateral balances, at par\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 274: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(d)\n</td> <td>the net asset value of our mutual fund and the external investor portion of the net asset value (pre-redemptions and subscriptions) of our long/short credit funds, emerging markets, multi-product macroeconomic, fund of hedge funds vehicles and other hedge funds (see Fee-earning AUM based on net asset value\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 275: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(e)\n</td> <td>the gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage), excluding cash and cash equivalents of our business development companies and certain carry funds;

As such, Fee-earning AUM may be greater than total AUM when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is less than the cost of those investments.\nOur calculations of Fee-earning AUM and AUM may differ from the calculations of other alternative asset managers and, as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by others. In addition, our calculation of AUM includes uncalled commitments to, and the fair value of invested capital in, our funds from Carlyle and our personnel, regardless of whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to management or performance fees. Our calculations of Fee-earning AUM or AUM are not based on any definition of Fee-earning AUM or AUM that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage or advise.\nWe generally use Fee-earning AUM as a metric to measure changes in the assets from which we earn recurring management fees. Total AUM tends to be a better measure of our investment and fundraising performance as it reflects assets at fair value plus available uncalled capital.\nAvailable Capital\nAvailable capital, commonly known as dry powder,\u201d for our carry funds, fund of funds vehicles and NGP management fee funds refer to the amount of capital commitments available to be called for investments. Amounts previously called may be added back to available capital following certain distributions. Expired Available Capital\u201d occurs when a fund has passed the investment and follow-on periods and can no longer invest capital into new or existing deals. Any remaining Available Capital, typically a result of either recycled distributions or specific reserves established for the follow-on period that are not drawn, can only be called for fees and expenses and is therefore removed from the Total AUM calculation.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Available Capital and Fair Value of Capital, and the resulting rollforward of Total AUM.\nTable 295: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Comparisons between the our carry fund appreciation and the MSCI All Country World Index are included for informational purposes only.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidation of Certain Carlyle Funds and Variable Interest Entities\nPursuant to U.S. GAAP, we consolidate certain Carlyle sponsored funds, related co-investment entities and CLOs that we advise, which we refer to collectively as the Consolidated Funds, in our consolidated financial statements. These funds represent approximately 13.7% of our AUM as of December 31, 2015, approximately 12% of our fund management fees and approximately 4% of our performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe are not required under U.S. GAAP to consolidate in our financial statements most of the investment funds we advise because such funds provide their limited partners with the right to dissolve the fund without cause by a simple majority vote of the non-Carlyle affiliated limited partners, which overcomes the presumption of control by Carlyle. However, we consolidate certain CLOs that we advise as a result of the application of the accounting standards governing consolidations. As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated CLOs held approximately $19 billion of total assets and comprised 71% of the assets of the Consolidated Funds and substantially all of the loans payable of the Consolidated Funds. As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles had approximately $4 billion of total assets and comprised 16% of the assets of the Consolidated Funds. The remainder of the assets of the Consolidated Funds as of December 31, 2015 primarily relate to our consolidated hedge funds and other consolidated funds. The assets and liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are generally held within separate legal entities and, as a result, the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are non-recourse to us.\nGenerally, the consolidation of the Consolidated Funds has a gross-up effect on our assets, liabilities and cash flows but has no net effect on the net income attributable to the Partnership and partners' capital. The majority of the net economic ownership interests of the Consolidated Funds are reflected as non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, and partners' capital appropriated for Consolidated Funds in the consolidated financial statements. For further information, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBecause only a small portion of our funds are consolidated, the performance of the Consolidated Funds is not necessarily consistent with or representative of the combined performance trends of all of our funds.\nIn addition, as described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of September 30, 2013, we began consolidating Urbplan, a Brazilian real estate portfolio company of certain of our real estate investment funds. Due to the timing and availability of financial information of Urbplan, we consolidate the financial position and results of operations of Urbplan on a financial reporting lag of 90 days. As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated financial statements included approximately $191 million of assets related to Urbplan.\nOn February 18, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-2, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. ASU 2015-2 provides a revised consolidation model for all reporting entities to use in evaluating whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities will be subject to reevaluation under this revised consolidation model. The revised consolidation model, among other things, (i) modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and (iii) modifies the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs through fee arrangements and related party relationships. This guidance in ASU 2015-2 is effective for us beginning on January 1, 2016. As a result, the Partnership will reduce the number of funds consolidated by the Partnership on January 1, 2016. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table and discussion sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on substantially the same basis for all historical periods presented; however, the consolidated funds are not the same entities in all periods shown due to changes in U.S. GAAP, changes in fund terms and the creation and termination of funds. We formed six CLOs in 2013, eight CLOs in 2014, and eight CLOs in 2015 and consolidated those CLOs beginning on their respective formation dates or closing dates. As further described below, the consolidation of these funds had the impact of increasing interest and other income of Consolidated Funds, interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds, and net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds in the year that the fund is initially consolidated. The consolidation of these funds had no effect on net income attributable to the Partnership for the periods presented. In addition, as described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of September 30, 2013, we began consolidating Urbplan, a Brazilian real estate portfolio company of certain of our real estate investment funds.\nTable 307: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The decrease in transaction and portfolio advisory fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and the increase in transaction and portfolio advisory fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily due to greater investment activity, mainly in our buyout funds, in 2014 as compared to 2015 and 2013, respectively.\nPerformance Fees.

During 2015, the global economy weakened. We believe this weakness is attributable to three primary and interrelated factors: the economic climate in China, crude oil prices and the availability of credit. In China, there has been a significant reduction in the capital spending of businesses operating in the energy, metals, and mining industries due to low commodity prices, which generally do not support new capital investment in businesses in these industries. The industrial sector of the U.S. has also seen a significant reduction in energy-related capital spending. The industrial production index declined 1.8% in 2015, the first 12-month decline in U.S. industrial output since 2009. This downturn in the industrial sector has created a tightening of credit availability for transactions, resulting in market volatility. This volatility can impact our public portfolio valuations. Amongst these market conditions, our carry fund portfolio appreciated 7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to carry fund portfolio appreciation of 15% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Furthermore, approximately $219 million in performance fees from our Legacy Energy funds and CEMOF funds were reversed during 2015.\nThe decrease in performance fees recorded in 2014 as compared to 2013 were due principally to lesser appreciation in our carry funds in 2014 as compared to 2013, as well as the lack of any significant hedge fund incentive fees during 2014 and because two corporate private equity funds, CEP III and CAP III, exceeded their performance thresholds in 2013, resulting in a cumulative catch-up of performance fees in 2013 versus performance fee accruals in 2014 at a normalized rate. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the hedge funds generated incentive fees of $145.7 million, whereas hedge fund incentive fees for 2014 were not significant. During 2014, the general economic climate started the year weaker, but by the second half of the year, the U.S. macroeconomic outlook improved with gross domestic product growth averaging nearly 4% at an annualized rate. This acceleration in growth helped to offset the 2.1% contraction in the first quarter of 2014 and bring GDP growth for the year to roughly 2.5%. Stock markets outside of the U.S. were generally weaker in 2014, with the EuroStoxx index up to 3%, the MSCI ex-U.S. index down by 5.7% and the MSCI Emerging index down by 3.5%.\nIn addition, performance fees from consolidated funds decreased $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and performance fees from consolidated funds decreased $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. These fees eliminate upon consolidation.\nInvestment Income (Loss). Investment income increased $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and decreased $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to the following:\nTable 311: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease (increase) in investment losses from the investment in\nNGP, primarily due to carried interest reversals in NGP X\nbeing higher in 2014 than 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (Absence of) investment gain associated with the sale of a\nEuropean real estate investment in 2014\n</td> <td>(22.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>22.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase (decrease) in investment income from a European real\nestate investment\n</td> <td>41.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> All other changes\n</td> <td>(15.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total increase (decrease) in investment income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest and Other Income of Consolidated Funds. Our CLOs generate interest income primarily from investments in bonds and loans inclusive of amortization of discounts and generate other income from consent and amendment fees. Also included in this balance is interest income and dividend income recognized by the consolidated fund of funds vehicles and consolidated hedge funds. Substantially all interest and other income of the CLOs and other consolidated funds together with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment gains of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the related funds' limited partners or CLO investors and therefore is allocated to non-controlling interests. Accordingly, such amounts have no material impact on net income attributable to the Partnership.\nInterest and other income of consolidated funds increased $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and decreased $87.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013.

Revenue of a consolidated real estate VIE was $86.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $70.2 million in 2014 and $7.5 million in 2013. During 2014 and throughout 2015, Urbplan completed several land development projects and, therefore, the increase in revenue of a consolidated real estate VIE in 2015 and 2014 primarily represents an increase in completed land development projects in 2015 relative to 2014 and 2014 relative to 2013. Urbplan recognizes revenue for land development services under the completed contract method.

As a result of the restructuring, the Partnership's economic interest in Carlyle Commodity Management increased from 55% to approximately 83% effective July 1, 2015; no consideration was paid by the Partnership for the increase in economic interest. As a result of the restructuring, the estimated value of the employment-based contingent consideration liability related to Carlyle Commodity Management decreased by $46.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nEquity-based compensation. Equity-based compensation increased $34.0 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase in equity-based compensation from 2014 to 2015 is due to the ongoing granting of deferred restricted common units to new and existing employees during 2014 and 2015. Also contributing to the increase in equity-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 was a decrease to the estimated forfeiture rates in the first quarter of 2015.\nEquity-based compensation increased $21.6 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase in equity-based compensation from 2013 to 2014 is due to the ongoing granting of deferred restricted common units to new and existing employees during 2013 and 2014. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in expense of $30.8 million recognized on vesting for the difference between the estimated forfeitures and actual forfeitures on Carlyle Holdings partnership units that vested during these periods.\nPerformance fee related compensation expense. Performance fee related compensation expense decreased $362.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and decreased $310.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. Performance fee related compensation expense as a percentage of performance fees was 62%, 52%, and 50% in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For our largest segment, Corporate Private Equity, our performance fee related compensation expense is generally 45%. The overall percentage of 62% for the year ended December 31, 2015 is higher than 52% for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to performance fees earned during the year by our private equity fund of funds vehicles in our Investment Solutions segment (which pay a higher ratio of performance fees as compensation) and our Legacy Energy funds within our Real Assets segment (which had carry reversals during the year without the corresponding reversal of performance fee compensation expense).\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General, administrative and other expenses increased $186.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and increased $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to:\nTable 316: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher intangible asset amortization and impairment\nexpenses *\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher expenses for litigation and contingencies\n(See Note 11)\n</td> <td>60.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher (lower) external fundraising costs\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange adjustments and other changes\n</td> <td>(31.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total increase in general, administrative and other expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, we evaluate our intangible assets (including goodwill) for impairment and could record additional impairment losses in future periods. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded an impairment loss of $15.0 million to reduce the carrying value of the intangible assets related to the fund of hedge funds within the Investment Solutions segment to their estimated fair value. During the third week of February 2016, we decided to restructure our Investment Solutions segment to focus on private market secondaries, co-investment and managed account activities and, given the challenging market environment, discontinue our fund of hedge funds and liquid alternative initiatives. On February 19, 2016, we commenced a wind down of the operations of Diversified Global Asset Management Corporation ( DGAM\u201d) and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $7.0 million in our results for the year ended December 31, 2015 that had not been previously reflected in our earnings presentation issued on February 10, 2016. In addition, we estimate we will incur between $10.0 million and $15.0 million in employee separation and other contract termination costs associated with the wind down of DGAM in 2016.\nInterest. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $58.0 million, an increase of $2.3 million from 2014. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $55.7 million, an increase of $10.2 million from 2013. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 was due primarily to the interest on $400 million and $200 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2043 issued in March 2013 and March 2014, respectively. The increase in interest expense from 2013 to 2014 was partially offset by $1.9 million of expense recorded in 2013 related to deferred financing costs expensed upon the early extinguishment of debt.\nInterest and Other Expenses of Consolidated Funds. Interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds decreased $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and increased $151.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily\ndue to lower interest expense on the consolidated hedge funds and lower other expenses on the consolidated fund of funds vehicles, substantially offset by higher interest expense on the consolidated CLOs. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 relates primarily to the additional interest expense incurred related to the six CLOs formed throughout 2013 and the eight CLOs formed in 2014.\nThe CLOs incur interest expense on their loans payable and incur other expenses consisting of trustee fees, rating agency fees and professional fees. Substantially all interest and other income of our CLOs and other consolidated funds together with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the related funds' limited partners or CLO investors and therefore is allocated to non-controlling interests. Accordingly, such amounts have no material impact on net income attributable to the Partnership.\nInterest and Other Expenses of a Consolidated Real Estate VIE. Interest and other expenses of a consolidated real estate VIE decreased $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and increased $141.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to:\nTable 317: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher expenses associated with land development services as a\nresult of the completion of the related land development\nprojects\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Lower) higher expenses related to fair market value adjustment\nfor Urbplan loans *\n</td> <td>(37.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>34.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher interest expense\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Lower) higher compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Lower) higher general, administrative and other expenses\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>32.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (decrease) increase in interest and other expenses of a\nConsolidated Real Estate VIE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* The Partnership records the Urbplan loans at fair value at each reporting period and records the change in fair value to interest and other expenses of a consolidated real estate VIE.\nAdditionally, the increase in interest and other expenses of a consolidated real estate VIE for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 includes Urbplan expenses for 2013 only for the period from September 30, 2013 (the date that the Partnership began consolidating Urbplan) through December 31, 2013, as compared to a full year of operating expenses for 2014.\nOther Non-operating (Income) Expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, this caption primarily represents the change in the fair value of contingent consideration associated with the Partnership's acquisitions. The contingent consideration arrangements are primarily associated with the Partnership's hedge fund acquisitions.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the overall estimated fair value of the contingent consideration associated with the Partnership's hedge fund acquisitions decreased based on management's assumptions in the probability-weighted discounted cash flow models used to estimate the fair value of these contingent considerations at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nGenerally, the contingent consideration associated with the Partnership's acquisitions is payable at future dates over a period of years. Because the estimated fair value of these obligations relies upon estimates of cash flows in those future periods, there will be inherent volatility in the fair value of the Partnership's liability (and as a result, the periodic expense recognized) until such time as the future cash flow projections become more definitive. However, if the financial performance of the acquisitions is consistent with, or exceeds, the Partnership's original financial forecast at acquisition, the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities will increase over time (with a corresponding expense) as the actual performance measurement date for the payment approaches.\nNet Investment Gains of Consolidated Funds.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 net investment gains of Consolidated Funds was $864.4 million, $887.0 million, and $696.7 million, respectively. This balance is driven predominantly by our consolidated AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles, CLOs, and hedge funds. For the consolidated CLOs, the amount includes the net gain or loss on the fair value adjustment of both the assets and liabilities. The components of net investment gains of consolidated funds for the respective periods are comprised of the following:\nTable 318: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,114.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,107.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>662.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized gains (losses)\n</td> <td>(688.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(249.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>728.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gains\n</td> <td>426.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>857.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,390.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains (losses) on liabilities of CLOs\n</td> <td>436.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(695.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains on other assets of CLOs\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment gains of Consolidated Funds\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>864.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>887.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>696.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe unrealized investment gains/losses include the appreciation/depreciation of the equity investments within the consolidated AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles, the appreciation/depreciation of CLO investments in loans and bonds, as well as the appreciation/depreciation of investments made by our consolidated hedge funds and other consolidated funds.

Our segment information is reflected in the manner used by our senior management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. Included in our 2015 general, administrative and other expenses for both our U.S. GAAP financial results and ENI is a $50 million reserve for ongoing litigation and contingencies that is excluded from Fee Related Earnings and Distributable Earnings, as the timing of any payment remains uncertain. This reserve has been allocated to our business segments in accordance with our allocation policies for overhead.\nFor segment reporting purposes, revenues and expenses are presented on a basis that deconsolidates our Consolidated Funds. As a result, segment revenues from management fees, performance fees and investment income are different than those presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis because fund management fees recognized in certain segments are received from Consolidated Funds and are eliminated in consolidation when presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis. Furthermore, segment expenses are different than related amounts presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis due to the exclusion of fund expenses that are paid by the Consolidated Funds. Segment revenue and expenses are also different than those presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis because we present our segment revenues and expenses related to Claren Road, ESG, and, for periods prior to July 1, 2015, Carlyle Commodity Management based on our 55% economic interest in those entities. Effective July 1, 2015, our segment revenue and expenses related to Carlyle Commodity Management are based on our approximate 83% economic interest in that entity. For periods prior to August 1, 2013 (the date we acquired the remaining 40% equity interest in AlpInvest), we present our segment revenues and expenses based on our historical ownership interest in AlpInvest of 60%. Also, ENI excludes expenses associated with equity-based compensation that was issued in our initial public offering or is issued in acquisitions and strategic investments.\nCorporate Private

The increase in catch-up management fees was driven primarily by subsequent closings in 2015 from our fourth Europe buyout fund ( CEP IV\u201d), CJP III, and our third Europe technology fund ( CETP III\u201d), as compared to subsequent closings in 2014 from our fourth Asia buyout fund ( CAP IV\u201d) and our second global financial services fund ( CGFSP II\u201d).\nThe increase in management fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily due to CP VI and CAP IV commencing management fees in 2013 and CEP IV commencing management fees in 2014.\nThe weighted average management fee rate increased from 1.22% at December 31, 2014 to 1.26% at December 31, 2015. The increase in the weighted average management fee rate reflects new funds being raised with higher management fee rates, namely CEP IV, CAP IV, and CEOF II. Fee-earning AUM was $40.9 billion and $40.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, reflecting an increase of $0.7 billion.\nThe weighted average management fee rate increased from 1.15% at December 31, 2013 to 1.22% at December 31, 2014. The increase in the weighted average management fee rate reflects new commitments to funds with higher management fee rates, namely CAP IV and CEP IV. Fee-earning AUM was $40.2 billion and $43.0 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $2.8 billion.\nThe decrease in transaction fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and the increase in transaction fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily due to higher investment activity, primarily in our buyout funds, in 2014 as compared to 2015 and 2013, respectively.\nDirect and indirect compensation expense. Direct and indirect compensation expense decreased $8.5 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and lower bonuses in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in headcount as well as increased compensation costs related to fundraising activities of approximately $2.3 million, primarily related to fundraising for our second U.S. mid-market buyout fund ( CEOF II\u201d) and CEP IV.\nDirect and indirect base compensation expense increased $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or 5%, as compared to 2013. The increase is primarily due to incremental compensation related to increased headcount, promotions, and bonuses, primarily for our buyout funds. This increase was partially offset by lower compensation associated with fundraising efforts in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower negative foreign currency adjustments and lower professional fees.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease is primarily due to lower external costs associated with fundraising activities in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nEconomic Net Income\nEconomic net income decreased $462.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and decreased $192.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013.

The recognition of realized performance fees results in a reversal of accumulated unrealized performance fees, generally resulting in minimal impact on total performance fees. Additionally, because unrealized performance fees can be reversed upon a realization event, in periods where the Partnership generates significant realized performance fees unrealized performance fees can be negative even in periods of portfolio appreciation.\nTotal Investment Income. Total investment income (realized and unrealized) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $18.1 million compared to investment income of $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in investment income from 2014 to 2015 relates primarily to lower appreciation on investments in certain buyout funds.\nInvestment income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $31.6 million compared to investment income of $26.2 million in 2013. The increase in investment income from 2013 to 2014 relates primarily to higher gains on investments in certain Europe buyout funds.\nEquity-based Compensation. Equity-based compensation was $65.1 million, $42.5 million, and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The increase from 2014 to 2015 and the increase from 2013 to 2014 are due to the ongoing granting of deferred restricted common units to new and existing employees during 2013, 2014 and 2015, and a decrease in the estimated forfeiture rates during 2013 and 2015.\nReserve for Litigation and Contingencies. Corporate Private Equity's share of a reserve for litigation and contingencies was $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Inflows of $6.4 billion were primarily related to limited partner commitments raised by CEP IV, CJP III, and the activation of commitments in CEOF II. This was offset by outflows of $4.9 billion which were principally a result of distributions from several buyout funds that were outside of their investment period, in addition to the reduction in management fee basis from commitments to invested equity for funds at the end of their original investment period and $0.6 billion in foreign exchange loss. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 15% of the total external commitments raised for our global buyout fund ( CGP\u201d) in current and prior periods are reflected in fee-earning AUM, as this fund is based on invested equity. Investment and distribution activity by funds still in the investment period does not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments.\nFee-earning AUM was $40.2 billion at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $2.8 billion, or 6%, compared to $43.0 billion at December 31, 2013. Outflows of $6.5 billion were principally a result of distributions from several buyout funds that were outside of their investment period, in addition to the reduction in management fee basis for funds at the end of their original investment period and $1.3 billion in foreign exchange loss. This was offset by inflows of $4.8 billion, primarily related to limited partner commitments raised by CAP IV, CEP IV, CGFSP II, and CETP III.\nFee-earning AUM was $43.0 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $9.2 billion, or approximately 27%, compared to $33.8 billion at December 31, 2012. Inflows of $17.2 billion were primarily related to limited partner commitments raised by CP VI, CAP IV, and CGFSP II, as well as equity invested by various funds outside of their investment period. Outflows of $7.5 billion were partially driven by (a) a $3.9 billion decrease resulting from the change in basis from commitments to invested capital for CP V, CAP III, and our first global financial services fund ( CGFSP I\u201d), and (b) $3.6 billion of distributions from several funds that were outside of their investment period.\nTotal AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2015.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforwards of Available Capital and Fair Value of Capital, and the resulting rollforward of Total AUM.\nTable 345: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Available Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value of\nCapital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total AUM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Private Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, As of December 31, 2012\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments (1)\n</td> <td>11,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Called, net (2)\n</td> <td>(5,313\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(315\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions (3)\n</td> <td>946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,974\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,028\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) (4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange and other (5)\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, As of December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments (1)\n</td> <td>6,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Called, net (2)\n</td> <td>(7,380\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(562\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions (3)\n</td> <td>997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,742\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,745\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) (4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange and other (5)\n</td> <td>(584\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,299\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,883\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, As of December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments (1)\n</td> <td>7,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Called, net (2)\n</td> <td>(8,355\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(610\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions (3)\n</td> <td>693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,505\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,812\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) (4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange and other (5)\n</td> <td>(482\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(896\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,378\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 346: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents capital raised by our carry funds, net of expired available capital.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 347: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Represents capital called by our carry funds, net of fund fees and expenses.

This decrease was primarily driven by $13.5 billion in distributions, of which $0.7 billion is recallable, and $1.4 billion of foreign exchange loss. Offsetting this were increases of $7.9 billion from new commitments driven by fundraising in CEP IV, CEOF II, CGP, CJP III and other funds and coinvestment vehicles and $5.4 billion of market appreciation, representing a 13% increase in our portfolio of carry funds for the period. Our public portfolio appreciated 22% ($3.0 billion), our private portfolio appreciated 6% ($1.3 billion), and the remainder of our appreciation was in our coinvestment vehicles. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $1.3 billion attributable to CEP III (25% appreciation), $1.0 billion attributable to CAP III (45% appreciation), and $0.4 billion attributable to CP V (3% appreciation).\nTotal AUM was $64.7 billion at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $0.2 billion, or 0.30%, compared to $64.9 billion at December 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily driven by (a) distributions of $14.7 billion, of which $1.0 billion is recallable, and (b) foreign exchange loss of $1.9 billion. Offsetting this decrease were (a) commitments of $6.7 billion in CAP IV, CEP IV, CETP III, CGFSP II and other funds and coinvestment vehicles, and (b) a total 2014 appreciation in remaining fair value of assets of 23%, leading to market appreciation in the segment of $9.3 billion. Our public portfolio appreciated 36% ($5.6 billion), our private portfolio appreciated 12% ($2.2 billion), and the remainder of our appreciation was in our\ncoinvestment vehicles. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $3.2 billion attributable to CP V (24% appreciation), $2.8 billion attributable to CEP III (46% appreciation), and $0.4 billion attributable to CP IV (9% appreciation).\nTotal AUM was $64.9 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $11.6 billion, or approximately 22%, compared to $53.3 billion at December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily driven by (a) $11.5 billion of new commitments for several funds, including CP VI, CAP IV, CGFSP II, CSSAF I, CJP III, our Ireland fund ( CCI\u201d) and various co-investments, and (b) market appreciation across our portfolio of $10.3 billion. The total 2013 appreciation in the remaining value of assets for funds in this segment was approximately 30%, driven by a 30% increase in the buyout funds and a 32% increase in the growth funds. Our public portfolio appreciated 48% ($6.4 billion), our private portfolio appreciated 17% ($3.1 billion), and the remainder of our appreciation was in our coinvestment vehicles.

Our measurements of Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR may not be comparable to those of other companies that use similarly titled measures. We do not present Realized/Partially Realized performance information separately for funds that are still in the investment period because of the relatively insignificant level of realizations for funds of this type. However, to the extent such funds have had realizations, they are included in the Realized/Partially Realized performance information presented for Total Corporate Private Equity.\nTable 357: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(6)\n</td> <td>Fully Invested funds are past the expiration date of the investment period as defined in the respective limited partnership agreement.

Offsetting these decreases were increases in management fees from the Claren Road and ESG hedge funds from greater assets under management of $16.3 million.\nThe weighted average management fee rate on our hedge funds decreased from 1.73% at December 31, 2014 to 1.59% at December 31, 2015 due to reduced AUM from net redemptions in our Claren Road funds, which charge a higher rate. The weighted average management fee rate on our carry funds decreased from 1.48% at December 31, 2014 to 1.38% at December 31, 2015 due to the reduction in both the fee basis and rate of CSP III and CEMOF I as they switched from commitments to invested equity at the end of their respective original investment periods.\nThe weighted average management fee rate on our hedge funds decreased from 1.77% at December 31, 2013 to 1.73% at December 31, 2014 due to higher AUM in the ESG hedge funds, which charge a lower rate, and decreases in AUM in the Carlyle Commodity Management hedge funds. The weighted average management fee rate on our carry funds decreased from 1.53% at December 31, 2013 to 1.48% at December 31, 2014 due to a step down in fee basis from commitments to invested capital on our second corporate mezzanine fund ( CMP II\u201d).\nDirect and indirect compensation expense. Direct and indirect compensation expense decreased $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower headcount and bonuses in 2015, partially offset by incremental compensation costs of $4.5 million related to fundraising activities, primarily associated with our second energy mezzanine fund ( CEMOF II\u201d).\nDirect and indirect base compensation increased $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, which primarily relates to incremental compensation costs related to increased headcount, promotions, and bonuses.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses increased $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to higher external costs associated with fundraising activities of $10.4 million, mostly related to our second energy mezzanine fund, partially offset by lower negative foreign currency adjustments.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease is primarily due to higher external costs associated with fundraising activities for the business development companies and for carry funds during 2013 as compared to 2014.\nEconomic Net Income (Loss)\nEconomic net income (loss) decreased $155.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and decreased $112.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013.

Total investment loss (realized and unrealized) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $10.3 million compared to investment income of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in investment income from 2014 to 2015 relates primarily to depreciation on U.S.-denominated collateralized loan obligations as well as investment losses in 2015 in CEMOF as compared to investment income in 2014.\nTotal investment income was $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to investment income of $16.0 million in 2013. The decrease in investment income was due primarily to a realization of a debt investment in 2013 that resulted in a net investment gain of approximately $4.7 million. Also contributing to the decrease was lower appreciation on our CLO investments in 2014 as compared to 2013, which resulted in a decrease in investment income of $4.2 million from 2013 to 2014.\nEquity-based Compensation. Equity-based compensation was $19.0 million, $13.9 million, and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The increase from 2014 to 2015 and the increase from 2013 to 2014 are due to the ongoing granting of deferred restricted common units to new and existing employees during 2013, 2014 and 2015, and a decrease in the estimated forfeiture rates during 2013 and 2015.\nReserve for Litigation and Contingencies.

This was driven by $4.3 billion of net redemptions in our hedge funds, $1.0 billion of net outflows including distributions, primarily due to the change in basis from commitments to invested equity in CSP III and our first energy mezzanine fund ( CEMOF I\u201d), and $0.7 billion in market depreciation. This was partially offset by $2.4 billion of inflows, including commitments, primarily driven by new commitments in CEMOF II and a $0.9 billion increase in the collateral balances of our CLO's. Distributions from carry funds still in the investment period do not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments and not invested capital.\nFee-earning AUM was $33.9 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $0.5 billion, or 1%, compared to $33.4 billion at December 31, 2013. This was driven by a $1.9 billion increase in the aggregate par value of our CLO collateral balances as a result of the eight new CLOs issued during the year and $0.8 billion of subscriptions, net of redemptions in our hedge funds. These increases are offset by $1.5 billion in market depreciation, primarily in our hedge funds and $0.5 billion in distributions from our fully invested carry funds.\nFee-earning AUM was $33.4 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $2.4 billion, or 8%, compared to $31.0 billion at December 31, 2012. This increase was driven by $1.0 billion of subscriptions, net of redemptions, market appreciation of $0.8 billion in our hedge funds and $0.6 billion of new commitments raised by our carry funds. These increases are offset by $0.5 billion in distributions from our fully invested carry funds.\nTotal AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2015.\nThe table

This decrease was primarily driven by $4.4 billion in net redemptions from our hedge funds, $0.9 billion of market depreciation, representing a 8% ($0.2 billion) decrease on our portfolio of carry funds for the period and declines in our hedge funds, and $0.4 billion of foreign exchange decreases in our Euro-denominated CLOs. Offsetting these decreases were $2.7 billion of new commitments driven by fundraising in CEMOF II and $1.6 billion increases in the par value of our CLO collateral balances.\nTotal AUM was $36.7 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 4%, compared to $35.5 billion at December 31, 2013. This increase was driven by (a) changes in the aggregate par value of our CLO collateral balances of $2.1 billion, primarily due to eight new issue CLOs raised, and (b) commitments of approximately $0.2 billion related to our carry funds and their related coinvestments. These increases were partially offset by market depreciation of $1.2 billion, representing declines in our hedge funds partially offset by a 20% ($0.4 billion) increase on our portfolio of carry funds for the period, and distributions in our carry funds of $0.9 billion, of which $0.5 billion was recycled back into available capital. Increases due to subscriptions, net of redemptions, to our hedge funds of $0.9 billion in 2014 are exclusive of approximately $2.2 billion of net redemption notifications effective January 1, 2015.\nTotal AUM was $35.5 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $3.0 billion, or approximately 9%, compared to $32.5 billion at December 31, 2012. This increase was driven by (a) market appreciation of $1.4 billion, representing increases in our hedge funds coupled with a 28% ($0.5 billion) increase on our portfolio of carry funds for the period, (b) subscriptions, net of redemptions, to our hedge funds of $1.0 billion, (c) new commitments to our CSP III carry fund of approximately $0.3 billion, and (d) six new issue CLOs raised totaling $3.1 billion, offset by the liquidation of certain existing CLOs in accordance with their business plans. These increases were partially offset by distributions in our carry funds of $1.1 billion, of which $0.3 billion was recycled back into available capital.\nFund Performance Metrics\nFund performance information for certain of our Global Market Strategies Funds is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

The increase in catch-up management fees is primarily due from subsequent closings on our seventh U.S. real estate fund ( CRP VII\u201d), our first international energy fund ( CIEP I\u201d) and our second power fund ( CPP II\u201d). Also, the increase in fund management fees was due to the commencement of the investment period of CRP VII and CPP II in June 2014 when both funds began to charge management fees at such time, as well as higher assets under management from additional commitments raised during 2014 and 2015 in CRP VII, CIEP I, and CPP II. These increases were partially offset by declines in fund management fees from distributions from certain other U.S. and European real estate funds outside of their investment periods, which had the effect of lowering the management fee base of those funds.\nThe increase in management fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily due $40.9 million of incremental management fees earned in 2014 from CIEP I, which commenced its investment period in September 2013, including catch-up management fees earned in 2014 from subsequent closings of that fund of approximately $14.4 million. Also contributing to the increase was $16.1 million of incremental management fees from the commencement of management fees on CRP VII in 2014, which includes $3.3 million of catch-up management fees from subsequent closings of that fund. This increase was partially offset by declines in management fees from distributions from certain other U.S. and European real estate funds and NGP management fee funds outside of their investment periods.\nThe total weighted average management fee rate declined to 1.24% at December 31, 2015 from 1.31% at December 31, 2014 primarily due to new commitments to CRP VII and CPP II which charges a lower management fee rate compared to other funds. The weighted average management fee rate for funds in the investment period declined to 1.44% at December 31, 2015 from 1.54% at December 31, 2014 primarily due to fundraising in CRP VII and CPP II.\nThe total weighted average management fee rate increased to 1.31% at December 31, 2014 from 1.18% at December 31, 2013, primarily due to commitments to CRP VII and CIEP I. Despite the step down from commitments to invested capital in one of our Legacy Energy funds ( Renew II\u201d), from which we are entitled a 10% allocation of management fee related revenues, the weighted average management fee rate for funds in the investment period increased from 1.27% at December 31, 2013 to 1.54% at December 31, 2014 due to fundraising in CIEP I and CRP VII, from which we are entitled to 100% of management fee related revenues.\nDirect and indirect compensation expense. Direct and indirect compensation expense declined $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower bonuses in 2015 as well as lower compensation associated with fundraising of $7.1 million in 2015 versus 2014, driven by fundraising activities in 2014 related to CRP VII and CIEP I.\nDirect and indirect base compensation increased $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase in compensation was due primarily to increased compensation associated with fundraising efforts for CRP VII and NGP carry funds, as well as incremental compensation costs related to increased headcount, promotions, and bonuses.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to a decrease of $7.1 million in external costs associated with fundraising activities.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses increased $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase primarily relates to an increase in external costs associated with fundraising activities for CRP VII and CIEP I, as well as an increase in professional fees associated with CIEP I.\nEconomic Net Income (Loss)\nEconomic net income increased $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and economic net loss increased $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013.

The increase in net performance fees primarily relates to our real estate funds which appreciated 27% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to appreciation of 18% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $(13.2) million, representing a decline of $44.4 million from $31.2 million in net performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nTotal Investment Income (Loss). Total investment loss (realized and unrealized) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $30.5 million compared to total investment loss of $47.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The 2015 investment loss of $30.5 million was due primarily to $34 million in losses from our guarantee of liabilities of CEREP I associated with an adverse court judgment in a French tax court proceeding related to a transaction that CEREP I exited\nbetween 2007 and 2009. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The 2014 investment loss of $47.9 million was due primarily to unrealized losses associated with the guarantee of liabilities of CEREP I associated with the French tax court matter of $11.2 million, investment losses on certain other European real estate investments of $30.8 million, and losses associated with Urbplan of $24.3 million, partially offset by an investment gain of $22.5 million from the sale of another European real estate investment.\nTotal investment loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $47.9 million compared to an investment loss of $85.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decline in investment loss from 2013 to 2014 was due primarily to net investment losses on certain European real estate investments of $23.6 million in 2014 versus $76.6 million in 2013. This decline was offset by higher investment losses related to Urbplan, which were $24.3 million in 2014 versus $11.8 million in 2013.\nEquity-based Compensation. Equity-based compensation was $25.0 million, $19.2 million, and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The increase from 2014 to 2015 and the increase from 2013 to 2014 are due to the ongoing granting of deferred restricted common units to new and existing employees during 2013, 2014 and 2015, and a decrease in the estimated forfeiture rates during 2013 and 2015.\nReserve for Litigation and Contingencies.

This increase was driven by inflows of $8.4 billion primarily related to new commitments in CRP VII, CPP II, and CIEP I as well as the activation of previously raised commitments in NGP XI. This increase was partially offset by outflows of $5.7 billion, primarily related to distribution activity in our funds outside the original investment period in addition to the reduction in management fee basis for funds at the end of their original investment period. Investment and distribution activity by funds still in the original investment period do not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments and not invested capital. Changes in fair value have no impact on Fee-earning AUM for Real Assets as all of the funds generate management fees based on either commitments or invested capital at cost, neither of which is impacted by fair value movements.\nFee-earning AUM was relatively unchanged at $28.4 billion for the periods ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Outflows of $5.9 billion were principally due to distributions from our fully invested Legacy Energy funds, our U.S. and Europe real estate funds and foreign exchange loss of $0.3 billion. Inflows of $6.1 billion were primarily to commitments to CRP VII and CIEP I, in addition to investments made by our Legacy Energy funds, our U.S. real estate funds and NGP funds with fees based on invested equity.\nFee-earning AUM was $28.4 billion at December 31, 2013, a decrease of $0.9 billion, or 3%, compared to $29.3 billion at December 31, 2012. Outflows of $3.1 billion were principally due to distributions from our fully invested Legacy Energy funds, one of the NGP management fee funds ( NGP VIII\u201d), and U.S. real estate funds and related co-investments. Inflows of $2.1 billion were primarily related to investment activity in our power ( CPOCP\u201d) fund and related coinvestments, our infrastructure ( CIP\u201d) fund, and several of our real estate funds in the U.S., Europe and Asia that are outside of their initial investment period, in addition to commitments to CIEP I.\nTotal AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2015.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforwards of Available Capital and Fair Value of Capital, and the resulting rollforward of Total AUM.\nTable 453: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Available Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value of\nCapital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total AUM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, As of December 31, 2012\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments (1)\n</td> <td>1,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Called, net (2)\n</td> <td>(4,013\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions (3)\n</td> <td>845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,059\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,214\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) (4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange and other (5)\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, As of December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments (1)\n</td> <td>8,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Called, net (2)\n</td> <td>(3,612\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>469\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions (3)\n</td> <td>1,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,698\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,947\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) (4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange and other (5)\n</td> <td>(67\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(356\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, As of December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments (1)\n</td> <td>3,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Called, net (2)\n</td> <td>(3,530\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions (3)\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,842\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,795\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) (4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,357\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,357\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange and other (5)\n</td> <td>(43\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(255\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 454: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents capital raised by our carry funds and NGP management fee funds, net of expired available capital.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 455: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Represents capital called by our carry funds and NGP management fee funds, net of fund fees and expenses.

This decrease was primarily driven by $5.8 billion in distributions primarily related to our U.S. Real Estate, NGP Energy, and Legacy Energy funds and $2.4 billion of market depreciation, representing a 3% decrease in the value of our carry fund portfolio. Our public portfolio declined by 12% ($0.5 billion) and our private portfolio increased slightly by $0.1 billion with the remainder attributable to our coinvestment vehicles and NGP management fee funds. The carry funds driving depreciation for the period included $1.0 billion attributable to Energy IV (29% depreciation), $0.6 billion attributable to Energy III (40% depreciation), and $0.4 billion attributable to NGP X (14% depreciation), partially offset by $0.5 billion (30% appreciation) attributable to CRP VI . Offsetting this was $3.7 billion of new commitments driven by fundraising in CRP VII, NGP XI, and CPP II.\nTotal AUM was $42.3 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $3.6 billion, or 9%, compared to $38.7 billion at December 31, 2013. This increase is due to (a) commitments of $8.9 billion in CRP VII, NGP XI, CIEP I, CPP II and related coinvestment vehicles, and (b) market appreciation of $1.6 billion, despite a 2% decrease in values across the real assets carry funds due to the inclusion of the NGP management fee funds in Total AUM. Our public portfolio declined by 26% ($1.2 billion) and our private portfolio increased by 8% ($1.0 billion) with the remainder attributable to our coinvestment vehicles and NGP management fee funds. The carry funds driving depreciation for the period included $0.6 billion attributable to Energy IV (13% depreciation), $0.4 billion attributable to Energy III (21% depreciation), and $0.2 billion attributable to Energy\nII (59% depreciation), partially offset by $0.5 billion (35% appreciation) attributable to CRP VI and $0.5 billion attributable to NGP X. Offsetting this increase were net distributions of $6.9 billion, primarily in our Natural Resources and Legacy Energy fund platforms.\nTotal AUM was $38.7 billion at December 31, 2013, a decrease of $1.5 billion, or 4%, compared to $40.2 billion at December 31, 2012. The decrease was primarily due to distributions of $6.0 billion, of which approximately $0.8 billion was recycled back into available capital. This decrease was offset by commitments raised of $2.0 billion by CIEP I, CPOCP I, and various coinvestments and managed accounts in our Asia real estate funds. Market appreciation of $1.6 billion was driven by a 1% increase in values across the real assets carry funds, primarily driven by a 5% increase in our infrastructure and real estate funds. Our public portfolio increased by 5% ($0.2 billion) and our private portfolio remained relatively flat with the remainder attributable to our coinvestment vehicles and NGP management fee funds. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $0.3 billion attributable to CRP VI (42% appreciation), $0.3 billion attributable to CRP V (18% appreciation), and $0.2 billion attributable to Energy IV (4% appreciation), partially offset by $0.5 billion (19% depreciation) attributable to CEREP III.\nFund Performance Metrics\nFund performance information for our investment funds that have at least $1.0 billion in capital commitments, cumulative equity invested or total value as of December 31, 2015 and excluding the NGP management fee funds, which we refer to as our significant funds,\u201d is generally included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

As a result of our acquisition of the remaining 40% equity interest in AlpInvest on August 1, 2013, our segment results prospectively from that date reflect our 100% ownership interest in AlpInvest. Also, as a result of our acquisitions of Metropolitan on November 1, 2013 and DGAM on February 3, 2014, our segment results include the results of operations of Metropolitan and DGAM since that date.\nDuring the third week of February 2016, we decided to restructure our Investment Solutions segment to focus on private market secondaries, co-investment and managed account activities and, given the challenging market environment, discontinue our fund of hedge funds and liquid alternative initiatives. On February 19, 2016, the Partnership commenced a wind down of the operations of DGAM. While the restructuring did not impact our segment results for the year ended December 31, 2015, we expect that this action will improve our Investment Solutions segment results in the future, exclusive of costs incurred in connection with the wind down.

Total fee revenues decreased $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to the impact on management fees of the decline in the Euro exchange rate in 2015 as compared to 2014. Also contributing to the decrease in management fees was distributions from fund of funds vehicles outside the commitment fee period or weighted-average investment period, as well as changes in fee basis for fund of funds vehicles where the commitment fee period or weighted-average investment period has expired.\nTotal fee revenues increased $62.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to the increase of $15.9 million of management fees from our acquisition of Metropolitan, the incremental $17.5 million of management fees from our acquisition of DGAM, and the increase in management fees from our acquisition of the remaining 40% equity interest in AlpInvest in August 2013.\nDirect and indirect compensation expense. Direct and indirect compensation expense decreased $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to the decline in the Euro exchange rate in 2015 as compared to 2014 as well as lower headcount in 2015.\nDirect and indirect base compensation expense increased $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. After considering the increase in compensation expense from our acquisition of Metropolitan of $11.0 million and our acquisition of DGAM of $11.0 million, and the acquisition of the remaining 40% equity interest in AlpInvest, the increase was also due to incremental costs related to investments in additional investor relations personnel for the Investment Solutions business lines.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to lower professional fees and positive foreign currency adjustments due to the decline in the Euro exchange rate in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by higher real estate costs.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses increased $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase was due primarily to the increase in general, administrative and other indirect expenses from our acquisition of Metropolitan of $5.9 million and our acquisition of DGAM of $4.8 million, and the acquisition of the remaining 40% equity interest in AlpInvest.\nEconomic Net Income\nEconomic net income decreased $40.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and increased $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013.

We are entitled to 15% of the carried interest in respect of commitments from the historical owners of AlpInvest for the period between 2011 and 2020 and 40% of the carried interest in respect of all other commitments (including all future commitments from third parties).\nThe decrease in performance fees in 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily due to lower appreciation in our AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles in 2015 and the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar to the Euro in 2015. Our AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles appreciated 27% in 2015 as compared to 30% in 2014 while the Euro fell approximately 10% relative to the U.S. dollar, further decreasing the performance fees earned in 2015 relative to 2014.\nThe $127.7 million of performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 was driven primarily by performance fees recognized from the following funds:\n\u2022Co-investment Fund & Secondaries Fund (2012-2013) of $27.1 million,\n\u2022Co-investment Fund & Secondaries Fund (2009-2010) of $22.6 million,\n\u2022Partnership Fund (2008) of $12.2 million, and\n\u2022Co-investment Fund & Secondaries Fund (2011-2013) of $11.8 million.\nThe $192.9 million of performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 was driven primarily by performance fees recognized from the following funds:\n\u2022Co-investment Fund & Secondaries Fund (2012-2013) of $32.9 million,\n\u2022Co-investment Fund & Secondaries Fund (2009-2010) of $24.3 million,\n\u2022Partnership Fund (2007) of $14.5 million, and\n\u2022Partnership Fund (2008) of $13.8 million.\nThe $151.5 million of performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2013 was driven primarily by multiple fund of funds vehicles exceeding their performance threshold in 2013, resulting in the recognition of a cumulative catch-up of performance fees at such time.\nPerformance fees of $127.7 million, $192.9 million, and $151.5 million are inclusive of performance fees reversed of approximately $11.5 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. There were no reversals of performance fees for 2013.\nThe appreciation in remaining value of our AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles for this segment are as follows:\nTable 489: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AlpInvest fund of funds\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> <td>30%\n</td> <td>17%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $12.6 million, representing a decrease of $4.4 million from $17.0 million in net performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net performance fees for the year\nended December 31, 2014 were $17.0 million, representing an increase of $11.0 million from $6.0 million in net performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nEquity-based Compensation. Equity-based compensation was $12.4 million, $4.8 million, and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The increase from 2014 to 2015 and the increase from 2013 to 2014 are primarily due to the ongoing granting of deferred restricted common units to new and existing employees during 2013, 2014 and 2015, and a decrease in the estimated forfeiture rates during 2013 and 2015.\nReserve for Litigation and Contingencies.

This decrease was driven by outflows of $7.4 billion which were primarily due to distributions in the AlpInvest and Metropolitan funds outside of their commitment or weighted-average investment periods, in addition to the reduction in basis from commitments to invested equity for those fund of funds vehicles that reached the end of their commitment period. Also driving the decrease was $2.8 billion in foreign exchange attributable to the translation of our AlpInvest fee-earning AUM from Euro to USD. Partially offsetting the decrease were inflows of $5.7 billion in our AlpInvest and Metropolitan fund of fund vehicles. Distributions from funds still in the commitment or weighted-average investment period do not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments and not invested capital. Increases in fair value have an impact on Fee-earning AUM for Investment Solutions as fully committed funds are based on the lower of cost or fair value of the underlying investments. We may see further declines in Fee-earning AUM over the next five years if commitments from former owners of approximately $10 billion are not renewed. However, our plan is to raise new commitments with a higher fee-yield than that of the Fee-earning AUM over this time, which we expect will offset the impact on our fee revenues.\nFee-earning AUM was $33.1 billion at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $2.0 billion, or 6%, compared to $35.1 billion at December 31, 2013. Outflows of $6.3 billion were primarily due to distributions in the AlpInvest and Metropolitan funds outside of their commitment or weighted-average investment periods, in addition to the reduction in basis from commitments to invested equity for those fund of funds vehicles that reached the end of their commitment period. Distributions from funds still in the commitment fee period do not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments and not invested capital. In addition, there was $3.8 billion in foreign exchange loss on our AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles due to the decreasing value of the Euro in the translation to U.S. dollars as of the end of the period. Offsetting this decrease was the acquisition of DGAM in February 2014, with Fee-earning AUM of $2.9 billion and its subsequent net redemptions of $1.0 billion during the year. Inflows of $5.9 billion were primarily related to the initiation of fees on several 2014 mandates that made their first investment during the year and do not include approximately $3.3 billion of commitments raised in 2014 which have not yet activated their fees. Inflows also include amounts invested by funds outside of their commitment fee period that are based on the lower of cost or fair value of the underlying investments.\nFee-earning AUM was $35.1 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $6.2 billion, or approximately 21%, compared to $28.9 billion at December 31, 2012. Inflows of $7.6 billion were primarily related to the initiation of fees on several 2013 mandates that made their first investment during the year and also include amounts invested by funds outside of their commitment fee period that are based on the lower of cost or fair value of the underlying investments. This increase was also related to the acquisition of 22 fund of funds vehicles managed by Metropolitan of $2.2 billion. Outflows of $5.5 billion were principally a result of a change in basis from commitments to the lower of cost or fair value for vehicles that reached the end of their commitment fee period, as well as distributions from several funds outside of their commitment fee period. In addition, the segment experienced a $1.6 billion increase resulting from the translation of the euro-denominated funds into U.S. Dollars as of the end of the period.\nTotal AUM as of and for each

Offsetting these decreases was$3.2 billion of new commitments primarily in our AlpInvest and Metropolitan fund of funds vehicles and $7.7 billion of market appreciation. Market appreciation was driven by 25% appreciation ($7.6 billion) in our AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles, 8% appreciation ($0.1 billion) in our Metropolitan fund of funds vehicles, and 2% depreciation ($0.1 billion) in our DGAM fund of hedge funds vehicles.\nTotal AUM was $50.8 billion as of December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.0 billion, or 2%, compared to $49.8 billion as of December 31, 2013.

This was offset by (a) distributions of approximately $9.5 billion in the quarter, net of amounts recycled, (b) loss on the translation to U.S. dollars for our Euro-denominated funds of $5.3 billion, and (c) net redemptions of $1.1 billion in our fund of hedge funds vehicles.\nTotal AUM was $49.8 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $5.7 billion, or 13%, compared to $44.1 billion at December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily driven by (a) market appreciation of $5.1 billion, attributable to 17% appreciation in our AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles, (b) activation of new mandates during the year of approximately $4.7 billion, and (c) $2.1 billion from the Metropolitan acquisition.

Our management fees have largely covered our operating costs and we have distributed all realized performance fees after related compensation to equityholders. Historically, approximately 95% of all capital commitments to our funds have been provided by our fund investors, with the remaining amount typically funded by our senior Carlyle professionals, advisors and other professionals.\nOur Sources of Liquidity\nWe have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including cash on hand, annual cash flows, accumulated earnings and funds from our senior credit facility, including a term loan facility and a revolving credit facility with $750.0 million available as of December 31, 2015. We believe these sources will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for at least the next 12 months. If we determine that market conditions are favorable after taking into account our liquidity requirements, including the amounts available under our senior credit facility, we may seek to issue and sell common units in a registered public offering or to issue additional senior notes or other debt.\nCash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2015. However, a portion of this cash is allocated for specific business purposes, including, but not limited to, (i) performance fee-related cash that has been received but not yet distributed as performance fee related compensation and amounts owed to non-controlling interests; (ii) proceeds received from realized investments that are allocable to non-controlling interests; and (iii) regulatory capital. After deducting cash amounts allocated to these specific requirements, the remaining cash and cash equivalents is approximately $808 million as of December 31, 2015. This remaining amount will be used towards our primary liquidity needs, as outlined in the next section. This amount does not take into consideration ordinary course of business payables and reserves for specific business purposes, including, but not limited to, giveback obligations.\nSenior Credit Facility. The senior credit facility includes $25.0 million in a term loan and $750.0 million in a revolving credit facility. The term loan and revolving credit facility mature on May 5, 2020. Principal amounts outstanding under the amended term loan and revolving credit facility accrue interest, at the option of the borrowers, either (a) at an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin not to exceed 0.75%, or (b) at LIBOR plus an applicable margin not to exceed 1.75% (1.37% at December 31, 2015).\nOn May 5, 2015, the Partnership entered into Amendment No. 2 to the senior credit facility, which: (i) extended the maturity date of the term loan and revolving credit facility from August 9, 2018 to May 5, 2020, (ii) revised the management fee earning assets covenant to remove the step up requirement to add a percentage of future acquired AUM to set the minimum management fee earning assets amount, (iii) changed the definition of Indebtedness to provide for a deduction of unrestricted cash, and (iv) reduced the corporate ratings-based pricing grid.\nThe senior credit facility is unsecured. We are required to maintain management fee earning assets (as defined in the amended senior credit facility) of at least $65.3 billion and a total debt leverage ratio of less than 3.0 to 1.0, in each case, tested on a quarterly basis. Non-compliance with any of the financial or non-financial covenants without cure or waiver would constitute an event of default under the senior credit facility. An event of default resulting from a breach of certain financial or non-financial covenants may result, at the option of the lenders, in an acceleration of the principal and interest outstanding, and a termination of the revolving credit facility. The senior credit facility also contains other customary events of default, including\ndefaults based on events of bankruptcy and insolvency, nonpayment of principal, interest or fees when due, breach of specified covenants, change in control and material inaccuracy of representations and warranties.\nLoans Payable. Loans payable on our balance sheet at December 31, 2015 reflects $25.0 million outstanding under our senior credit facility, comprised of $25.0 million of term loan balance outstanding. No amount was outstanding under the revolving credit facility of our senior credit facility. Additionally, loans payable at December 31, 2015 includes $13.7 million outstanding under a separate term loan entered into during 2013 related to an investment in a CLO.\nCLO Term Loan. On October 3, 2013, the Partnership borrowed \u20ac12.6 million ($13.7 million at December 31, 2015) under a new term loan and security agreement with a financial institution. Interest on the term loan accrues at EURIBOR plus 1.75% (1.75% at December 31, 2015). The Partnership may prepay the facility in whole or in part at any time without penalty. The facility is scheduled to mature on the earlier of five years after closing or the date that the CLO is dissolved. The facility is secured by the Partnership's investment in the CLO.\n3.875% Senior Notes. In January 2013, Carlyle Holdings Finance L.L.C., an indirect finance subsidiary of the Partnership issued $500.0 million of 3.875% senior notes due February 1, 2023 at 99.966% of par. Interest is payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1, beginning August 1, 2013. The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Carlyle Holdings Finance L.L.C. and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by The Carlyle Group L.P. and each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. The indenture governing the notes contains customary covenants that, among other things, limit Carlyle Holdings Finance L.L.C. and the guarantors' ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. The notes also contain customary events of default. All or a portion of the notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the notes. If a change of control repurchase event occurs, the notes are subject to repurchase at the repurchase price as set forth in the notes.\n5.625% Senior Notes. In March 2013, Carlyle Holdings II Finance L.L.C., an indirect finance subsidiary of the Partnership, issued $400.0 million of 5.625% Senior Notes due March 30, 2043 at 99.583% of par. Interest is payable semi-annually on March 30 and September 30, beginning September 30, 2013. The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Carlyle Holdings Finance II L.L.C. and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by The Carlyle Group L.P. and each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. The indenture governing the notes contains customary covenants and financial restrictions that, among other things, limit Carlyle Holdings Finance II L.L.C. and the guarantors' ability, subject to certain exceptions, to incur indebtedness secured by liens on voting stock or profit participating equity interests of their subsidiaries or merge, consolidate or sell, transfer or lease assets. The notes also contain customary events of default. All or a portion of the notes may be redeemed at our option, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity, at the make-whole redemption price set forth in the notes. If a change of control repurchase event occurs, the notes are subject to repurchase at the repurchase price as set forth in the notes.\nIn March 2014, Carlyle Holdings II Finance L.L.C. issued $200.0 million of 5.625% Senior Notes due March 30, 2043 at 104.315% of par. These notes were issued as additional 5.625% Senior Notes due March 30, 2043 and will be treated as a single class with the already outstanding $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of these senior notes.\nObligations of CLOs. Loans payable of the Consolidated Funds represent amounts due to holders of debt securities issued by the CLOs. We are not liable for any loans payable of the CLOs. Several of the CLOs issued preferred shares representing the most subordinated interest, however these tranches are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity dates of the senior secured loans payable, and as a result have been classified as liabilities under U.S. GAAP, and are included in loans payable of Consolidated Funds in our combined and consolidated balance sheets.\nLoans payable of the CLOs are collateralized by the assets held by the CLOs and the assets of one CLO may not be used to satisfy the liabilities of another. This collateral consists of cash and cash equivalents, corporate loans, corporate bonds and other securities.\nLoans Payable of a Consolidated Real Estate VIE. Substantially all of Urbplan's customer and other receivables and investments have been pledged as collateral for the loans. As of December 31, 2015, substantially all of the loans payable of Urbplan are not in compliance with their related debt covenants or are otherwise in technical default. These violations do not cause a default or event of default under the Partnership's senior credit facility or senior notes. Urbplan management is in discussions with the lenders to cure or re-negotiate the loans in default. Currently there are no outstanding notices of acceleration of payment on the loans in default. All of the loans payable of Urbplan are contractually non-recourse to us.\nRealized performance fee revenue. Another source of liquidity we may use to meet our capital needs is the realized performance fee revenue generated by our investment funds. Carried interest is realized when an underlying investment is profitably disposed of and the fund's cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return. Incentive fees earned on hedge fund structures are realized at the end of each fund's measurement period. Incentive fees earned on our CLO vehicles generally are paid upon the dissolution of such vehicles.\nOur accrued performance fees by segment as of December 31, 2015, gross and net of accrued giveback

Distributions to the other limited partners of Carlyle Holdings paid during the calendar year ended December 31, 2015 were $848.5 million, representing the distributions paid in March 2015 of $1.61 per Carlyle Holdings unit with respect to the fourth quarter of 2014, $0.33 per Carlyle Holdings unit with respect to the first quarter of 2015, $0.89 per Carlyle Holdings unit with respect to the second quarter of 2015, and $0.60 per Carlyle Holdings unit with respect to the third quarter of 2015.\nWith respect to distribution year 2014, we declared distributions to the other limited partners of Carlyle Holdings totaling approximately $524.5 million, or $2.09 per Carlyle Holdings unit, consisting of the distributions declared in respect of\nthe first three quarters of 2014 and an additional distribution in respect of the fourth quarter of 2014 of $1.61 per Carlyle Holdings unit (approximately $404.1 million), which was paid on March 5, 2015 to holders of record of Carlyle Holdings units at the close of business on February 23, 2015. Distributions to the other limited partners of Carlyle Holdings paid during the calendar year ended December 31, 2014 were $486.9 million, representing the quarterly distributions paid in each of March, May, August, and November of 2014.\nWith respect to distribution year 2013, we declared distributions to the other limited partners of Carlyle Holdings totaling approximately $515.9 million, or $1.97 per Carlyle Holdings unit, consisting of the distributions declared in respect of the first three quarters of 2013 and an additional distribution in respect of the fourth quarter of 2013 of $1.40 per Carlyle Holdings unit ($366.5 million), which was paid in March 2014. Distributions to the other limited partners of Carlyle Holdings paid during the calendar year ended December 31, 2013 were $372.9 million, representing the quarterly distributions paid in each of March, May, August, and November of 2013.\nIt is Carlyle's intention to cause Carlyle Holdings to make quarterly distributions to its partners, including The Carlyle Group L.P.'s wholly owned subsidiaries, that will enable The Carlyle Group L.P. to pay a quarterly distribution of approximately 75% of Distributable Earnings per common unit, net of taxes and amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement, for the quarter. Carlyle's general partner may adjust the distribution for amounts determined to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of its business, to make appropriate investments in its business and its funds or to comply with applicable law or any of its financing agreements, or to provide for future cash requirements such as tax-related payments, clawback obligations and distributions to unitholders for any ensuing quarter. The amount to be distributed could also be adjusted upward in any one quarter. The declaration and payment of any distributions is at the sole discretion of Carlyle's general partner, which may change or eliminate the distribution policy at any time.\nDistributions for the 2014 fiscal year and prior years, including the fourth quarter 2014 distribution, were determined in accordance with Carlyle's distribution policy in effect for those years. For those periods, Carlyle Holdings made quarterly distributions to its partners, including The Carlyle Group L.P.'s wholly owned subsidiaries, that enabled The Carlyle Group L.P. to pay a quarterly distribution of $0.16 per common unit for each of the first three quarters of each year and for the fourth quarter of each year, to pay a distribution of at least $0.16 per common unit that, taken together with the prior quarterly distributions in respect of that year, represented its share, net of taxes and amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement, of Carlyle's Distributable Earnings in excess of the amount determined by Carlyle's general partner that was necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of Carlyle's business, to make appropriate investments in its business and its funds or to comply with applicable law or any of its financing agreements. The aggregate amount of our distributions for those years were less than our Distributable Earnings for that year due to these funding requirements.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the declaration and payment of any distributions will be at the sole discretion of our general partner, which may change our distribution policy at any time. Our general partner will take into account general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our business and investment opportunities, our financial condition and operating results, working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions and obligations, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, other constraints on the payment of distributions by us to our common unitholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our general partner may deem relevant.\nBecause our wholly owned subsidiaries must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreement, the amounts ultimately distributed by us to our common unitholders are expected to be less, on a per unit basis, than the amounts distributed by the Carlyle Holdings partnerships to the other limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships in respect of their Carlyle Holdings partnership units.\nFund commitments. Generally, we intend to have Carlyle commit to fund approximately 1% of the capital commitments to our future carry funds, although we may elect to invest additional amounts in funds focused on new investment areas. We may, from time to time, exercise our right to purchase additional interests in our investment funds that become available in the ordinary course of their operations. We expect our senior Carlyle professionals and employees to continue to make significant capital contributions to our funds based on their existing commitments, and to make capital commitments to future funds consistent with the level of their historical commitments. We also intend to make investments in our open-end funds and our CLO vehicles.\nSince our inception through December 31, 2015, we and our senior Carlyle professionals, advisors and other professionals have invested or committed to invest in or alongside our funds. Approximately 5% of all capital commitments to our funds are funded collectively by us and our senior Carlyle professionals, advisors and other professionals. The current invested capital and unfunded commitment of Carlyle and our senior Carlyle professionals, advisors and other professionals to our investment funds as of December 31, 2015, consisted of the following:\nTable 532: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset Class\n</td> <td>Current\nEquity\nInvested\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Unfunded\nCommitment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Current\nEquity Invested\nand Unfunded\nCommitment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Private Equity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,757.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,790.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,548.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Market Strategies\n</td> <td>1,145.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>335.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,480.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Assets\n</td> <td>886.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>709.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,596.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment Solutions\n</td> <td>225.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>260.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,014.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,870.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,885.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA substantial majority of these investments have been funded by, and a substantial majority of the remaining commitments are expected to be funded by, senior Carlyle professionals, advisors and other professionals through our internal co-investment program. Of the $2.9 billion of unfunded commitments, approximately $2.5 billion is subscribed individually by senior Carlyle professionals, advisors and other professionals, with the balance funded directly by the Partnership.\nInvestments as of December 31, 2015 consist of the following (Dollars in millions):\nTable 533: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>885.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Amounts attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities\n</td> <td>(263.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Strategic equity method investment in NGP Management\n</td> <td>(449.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments excluding non-controlling interests and NGP\n</td> <td>173.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: investments in Consolidated Funds, eliminated in consolidation\n</td> <td>218.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investments attributable to Carlyle Holdings, exclusive of NGP management\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRepurchase Program. In February 2016, the Board of Directors of the general partner of the Partnership authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of common units and/or Carlyle Holdings units. Under this unit repurchase program, units may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. We expect that the majority of repurchases under this program will be done via open market transactions. No units will be repurchased from our executive officers under this program. The timing and actual number of common units and/or Carlyle Holdings units repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price, and economic and market conditions. This unit repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date.\nCash Flows\nThe significant captions and amounts from our consolidated statements of cash flows which include the effects of our Consolidated Funds and CLOs in accordance with U.S. GAAP are summarized below.\nTable 534: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statements of Cash Flows Data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,902.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,645.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,994.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>(21.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(135.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(4,011.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,293.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,503.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange rate change\n</td> <td>(120.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(113.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(250.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>399.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by our earnings in the respective periods after adjusting for significant non-cash activity, including non-cash performance fees, the related non-cash performance fee related compensation, non-cash equity-based compensation, and depreciation, amortization and impairments, all of which are included in earnings.\nOperating cash inflows primarily include the receipt of management fees and realized performance fees, while operating cash outflows primarily include payments for operating expenses, including compensation and general, administrative, and other expenses. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, net cash provided by operating activities primarily includes the receipt of management fees and realized performance fees, totaling approximately $2.7 billion, $2.6 billion, and $2.2 billion, respectively. These inflows were partially offset by payments for compensation and general, administrative, and other expenses of approximately $1.9 billion, $2.3 billion, and $1.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nCash used to purchase investments and trading securities as well as the proceeds from the sale of such investments are also reflected in our operating activities as investments are a normal part of our operating activities. Over time, investment proceeds may be greater than investment purchases. During the year ended December 31, 2015, investment proceeds were $313.0 million while investment purchases were $91.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2014, investment proceeds were $544.4 million while investment purchases were $221.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2013, investment proceeds were $294.3 million while investment purchases were $93.0 million.\nThe remaining cash flows from operating activities primarily relate to the investment activity of our Consolidated Funds. For the year ended December 31, 2015, proceeds from the sales and settlements of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $11,653.6 million, while purchases of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $10,472.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2014, proceeds from the sales and settlements of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $10,685.6 million, while purchases of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $10,566.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2013, proceeds from the sales and settlements of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $11,631.6 million, while purchases of investments by the Consolidated Funds were $11,555.0 million.\nNet Cash Provided By (Used In) Investing Activities. Our investing activities generally reflect cash used for acquisitions, fixed assets and software for internal use, and changes in restricted cash. During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash used in investing activities principally reflects a change in restricted cash balances. Purchases of fixed assets were $62.3 million, $29.7 million and $29.5 million for the years ended the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the acquisition of DGAM resulted in the use of cash, net of cash acquired, of $3.1 million. The 2013 acquisition of Metropolitan resulted in the net use of cash of $10.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities. Financing activities are a net use of cash in each of the historical periods presented. In June 2015, the Partnership received net proceeds from the issuance of 7,000,000 common units of $209.9 million. The Partnership used these net proceeds to acquire 7,000,000 Carlyle Holdings partnership units from the other limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships.\nIn March 2014, the Partnership received net proceeds from the issuance of 13,800,000 newly issued common units of $449.5 million. The Partnership used $303.4 million of these proceeds to acquire 9,300,000 Carlyle Holdings partnership units from the other limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. The remaining net proceeds were used by the Partnership to acquire 4,500,000 newly issued Carlyle Holdings partnership units. Carlyle Holdings is using the proceeds from the issuance of the 4,500,000 Carlyle Holdings partnership units for general corporate purposes, including investments in our funds as well as investment capital for acquisitions of new fund platforms and strategies or other growth initiatives, to drive innovation across the broader Carlyle platform. Also, during March 2014, we received net proceeds of $210.8 million, net of financing costs, from the issuance of $200.0 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2043 at 104.315% of par. The net proceeds from this issuance is being used for general corporate purposes, including investments in our funds as well as investment capital for acquisitions of new fund platforms and strategies and other growth initiatives.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, we received net proceeds of $495.3 million, net of financing costs, from the issuance of $500.0 million of senior notes in January 2013 and $394.1 million, net of financing costs, for the issuance of $400.0 million of senior notes in March 2013. The proceeds from these senior notes issuances were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our term loan. For the year ended December 31, 2013, our repayments under our revolving credit facility were $386.3 million and our payments on our loans payable were $475.0 million. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2013, we received net proceeds of $17.1 million, net of financing costs, from the loan issued related to one of our European CLO investments.\nDistributions to our common unitholders were $251.0 million, $102.7 million, and $59.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Distributions to the non-controlling interest holders in Carlyle Holdings were $848.5 million, $486.9 million, and $372.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The net borrowings (payments) on loans payable by our Consolidated Funds during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $734.3 million, $(1,033.4) million, and $(1,595.2) million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, contributions from non-controlling interest holders were $2,376.6 million, $2,203.1 million, and $2,474.9 million, respectively, which relate primarily to contributions from the non-controlling interest holders in Consolidated Funds. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, distributions to non-controlling interest holders were $5,267.0 million, $4,190.4 million, and $3,038.0 million, respectively, which relate primarily to distributions to the non-controlling interest holders in Consolidated Funds.\nOur Balance Sheet\nTotal assets were $32.2 billion at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $3.8 billion from December 31, 2014. The decrease in total assets was primarily attributable to decreases in investments of Consolidated Funds, accrued performance fees, due from affiliates and other receivables of Consolidated Funds, and net intangible assets of $2.0 billion, $0.8 billion, $0.4 billion, and $0.3 billion, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.0 billion, a decrease of $0.3 billion from December 31, 2014.\nTotal liabilities were $23.3 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $0.1 billion from December 31, 2014. The increase in liabilities was primarily attributable to an increase in loans payable of Consolidated Funds, which increased $1.0 billion from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, and an increase in accrued giveback obligations, which increased $0.2 billion. These increases were partially offset by decreases in other liabilities of the Consolidated Funds and accrued compensation and benefits of $0.7 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively.\nThe assets and liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are generally held within separate legal entities and, as a result, the assets of the Consolidated Funds are not available to meet our liquidity requirements and similarly the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are non-recourse to us. The assets and liabilities of the consolidated real estate VIE are also held in separate legal entities; we have not guaranteed or assumed any obligation for repayment of its liabilities nor are its assets available to meet our liquidity requirements.\nOur balance sheet without the effect of the Consolidated Funds can be seen in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. At December 31, 2015, our total assets without the effect of the Consolidated Funds were $6.1 billion, including cash and cash equivalents of $1.0 billion and accrued performance fees of $3.0 billion.\nUnconsolidated Entities\nOur Corporate Private Equity funds have not historically utilized substantial leverage at the fund level other than short-term borrowings under certain fund level lines of credit which are used to fund liquidity needs in the interim between the date of an investment and the receipt of capital from the investing fund's investors. These funds do, however, make direct or indirect investments in companies that utilize leverage in their capital structure. The degree of leverage employed varies among portfolio companies.\nCertain of our real estate funds have entered into lines of credit secured by their investors' unpaid capital commitments or by a pledge of the equity of the underlying investment. Due to the relatively large number of investments made by these funds, the lines of credit are primarily employed to reduce the overall number of capital calls or for working capital needs. In certain instances, however, they may be used for other investment related activities, including serving as bridge financing for investments. The degree of leverage employed varies among portfolio companies.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements including sponsoring and owning limited or general partner interests in consolidated and non-consolidated funds, entering into derivative transactions, entering into operating leases and entering into guarantee arrangements. We also have ongoing capital commitment arrangements with certain of our consolidated and non-consolidated funds. We do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements that would require us to fund losses or guarantee target returns to investors in any of our other investment funds.\nFor further information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 2 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 on a consolidated basis and on a basis excluding the obligations of the Consolidated Funds:\nTable 535:

From 2013 through December 31, 2015, $321.5 million has been funded to Urbplan by us and our senior Carlyle professionals (net of gains from related foreign currency forward contracts). We have funded $77.9 million of the $321.5 million and the remaining $243.6 million has been funded by our senior Carlyle professionals indirectly through the Partnership. For the year ended December 31, 2015, $108.2 million was funded to Urbplan, of which we funded $27.1 million and the senior Carlyle professionals funded $81.1 million indirectly through us.\nFrom April 2013 through December 31, 2015, the cumulative investment losses related to Urbplan totaled $51.9 million, all of which are realized losses.\nWhile no contractual or other obligations exist to provide additional financial support to Urbplan, the Partnership and its senior Carlyle professionals may provide additional capital funding to Urbplan in the future. Urbplan will also continue to seek capital funding from unaffiliated parties and will seek to restructure existing debt obligations to reduce its cash requirements. Whether and to what extent the Partnership and its senior Carlyle professionals continue to provide financial support will be based on the circumstances at the time, including levels of third-party funding and the ability of the company to reach satisfactory agreements with its creditors. At this time, it is not expected that funding by the Partnership and its senior Carlyle professionals in 2016 would exceed $30 million.\nWe may not recover, in whole or in part, the capital that we have invested in or any additional capital that we may elect to invest in Urbplan in the future, and our results of operations could be adversely impacted by impairments, write-downs, lawsuits by customers or creditors, other claims against Urbplan or us or other losses associated with our investment in Urbplan. Urbplan is currently a party to various litigation, disputes and other potential claims. We do not believe it is probable that the outcome of any existing Urbplan litigation, government investigations and proceedings, disputes, or other potential claims will materially affect us or our consolidated financial statements.\nThe assets and liabilities of Urbplan are held in legal entities separate from the Partnership; we have not guaranteed or assumed any obligation for repayment of Urbplan's liabilities nor are the assets of Urbplan available to meet our liquidity requirements. However, if Urbplan fails to complete its construction projects, customers, partners, government agencies or municipalities or other creditors in certain circumstances might seek to assert claims against us and our assets unrelated to Urbplan under certain consumer protection or other laws.\nContingent Cash Payments For Business Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\nWe have certain contingent cash obligations associated with our business acquisitions and our strategic investment in NGP Management. For our business acquisitions, these contingent cash payments relate to performance-based contingent cash consideration payable to the sellers of the businesses, some of whom are Carlyle professionals. Certain of these payments to those Carlyle professionals require such Carlyle professionals to be employed by us at the time the performance conditions are met, while other payments are not contingent upon employment.\nFor our strategic investment in NGP Management, the contingent cash payments relate to performance-based contingent cash consideration payable to ECM Capital, L.P. and an affiliate of Barclays Bank PLC. The performance-based contingent cash consideration payable to an affiliate of Barclays Bank PLC totaling $183.0 million, payable as of December 31, 2015, was paid in January 2016 with $63.0 million in cash and $120.0 million in a six year promissory note (accruing interest at the three month LIBOR plus 2.5%) issued by the Partnership. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nThe amounts shown in the contractual obligations table above represent our probability-weighted estimate of amounts to be paid on the contingent cash consideration obligations associated with our business acquisitions and our strategic investment in NGP Management. Except as noted below, the following table represents the maximum amounts that could be paid from our contingent cash obligations associated with our business acquisitions and our strategic investment in NGP Management:\nTable 546: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Business\nAcquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NGP\nInvestment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Liability\nRecognized\non Financial\nStatements(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Performance-based contingent cash consideration\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>391.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employment-based contingent cash consideration\n</td> <td>148.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>356.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>228.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>584.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 547: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>On our consolidated balance sheet, the liability for performance-based contingent cash consideration is included in due to affiliates (for amounts owed to Carlyle professionals and NGP) and accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities (for amounts owed to other sellers), and the liability for employment-based contingent cash consideration is included in accrued compensation and benefits.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Some of the employment-based contingent cash consideration agreements do not contain provisions limiting the amount that could be paid by us. For purposes of the table above, we have used our current estimate of the amount to be paid upon the determination dates for such payments. In our consolidated financial statements, we record the performance-based contingent cash consideration from our business acquisitions at fair value at each reporting period. For the employment-based contingent cash consideration, we accrue the compensation liability over the implied service period.\nU.S. Risk Retention Rules\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires sponsors of asset-backed securities, including CLOs, to retain at least 5% of the credit risk related to the assets that underlie asset-backed securities (referred to herein as the U.S. Risk Retention Rules). The U.S. Risk Retention Rules become effective on December 24, 2016 and apply to sponsors of CLOs issued thereafter. As a sponsor of CLOs issued in Europe, we currently comply with similar risk retention rules that have been in place since 2014. To comply with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, we expect that we will contribute approximately $700 million to new CLOs issued over the next five years. Our contribution to the new CLOs will be funded through a variety of sources, including direct funding from the Partnership, funding from senior Carlyle professionals, and limited recourse borrowing. The allocation of funding sources, and therefore the amount of capital required from the Partnership, will be determined in the future.\nFor additional information related to the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, see -Regulatory changes in the United States could adversely affect our business and the possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens and expenses on our business\u201d within Item 1A.\nGuarantees\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to our material guarantees.\nIndemnifications\nIn many of our service contracts, we agree to indemnify the third-party service provider under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract, and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2015.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nHolders of partnership units in Carlyle Holdings (other than The Carlyle Group L.P.'s wholly owned subsidiaries), subject to the vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions applicable to such holders as set forth in the partnership agreements of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships, may (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement) exchange their Carlyle Holdings partnership units for The Carlyle Group L.P. common units on a one-for-one basis. A Carlyle Holdings limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of the three Carlyle Holdings partnerships to effect an exchange for a common unit. The exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Carlyle Holdings. These increases in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of tax that Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. and any other corporate taxpayers would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of that tax basis increase, and a court could sustain such a challenge.\nWe have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships that will provide for the payment by the corporate taxpayers to such parties of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that the corporate taxpayers realize as a result of these increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. This payment obligation is an obligation of the corporate taxpayers and not of Carlyle Holdings. While the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under this agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the price of our common units at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our income, we expect that as a result of the size of the transfers and increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Carlyle Holdings, the payments that we may make under the tax receivable agreement will be substantial.\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our tax receivable agreement.\nContingent Obligations (Giveback)\nCarried interest is ultimately realized when: (1) an underlying investment is profitably disposed of, (ii) certain costs borne by the limited partner investors have been reimbursed, (iii) the fund's cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return and (iv) we have decided to collect carry rather than return additional capital to limited partner investors. Realized carried interest may be required to be returned by us in future periods if the funds' investment values decline below certain levels. When the fair value of a fund's investments remains constant or falls below certain return hurdles, previously recognized performance fees are reversed.\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our contingent obligations (giveback).\nOther Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are a party to litigation, investigations, inquiries, employment-related matters, disputes and other potential claims. We discuss certain of these matters in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCarlyle Holdings Partnership Units\nRollforwards of the outstanding Carlyle Group L.P. common units and Carlyle Holdings partnership units for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\nTable 548: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Units as of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units Issued - DRUs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units Issued - Acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units\nForfeited\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units\nExchanged\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units as of\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Carlyle Group L.P. common units\n</td> <td>67,761,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,455,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,451\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,131,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,408,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carlyle Holdings partnership units\n</td> <td>251,195,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(444,477\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,131,214\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>243,619,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>318,956,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,455,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(465,928\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>324,028,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 549: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Units as of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units Issued - Public Offering\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units Issued - DRUs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units Issued - Acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units\nForfeited\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units\nExchanged\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Units as of\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Carlyle Group L.P. common units\n</td> <td>49,353,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,771,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>746,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,389,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,761,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Carlyle Holdings partnership units\n</td> <td>262,164,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>516,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,096,789\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,389,293\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>251,195,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>311,518,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,500,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,771,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,262,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,096,789\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>318,956,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Carlyle Group L.P. common units issued during the period from December 31, 2014 through December 31, 2015 relate to: (i) the vesting of the Partnership's deferred restricted common units during the year ended December 31, 2015, and (ii) the satisfaction of certain performance-based vesting contingent consideration arrangements related to our acquisition of DGAM. Further, The Carlyle Group L.P. common units in the table above includes 716,404 common units that the Partnership is expected to acquire from Carlyle Holdings in future periods upon the vesting of certain of the Partnership's unvested common units associated with the acquisition of the remaining 40% equity interest in AlpInvest in August 2013.\nThe Carlyle Group L.P. common units and Carlyle Holdings partnership units forfeited during the period from December 31, 2014 through December 31, 2015 primarily relate to unvested Carlyle Holdings partnership units and unvested common units that were forfeited when the holder ceased to provide services to the Partnership. The Carlyle Holdings partnership units exchanged relate to the exchange of Carlyle Holdings partnership units held by NGP for common units on a one-for-one basis and the Partnership's use of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of 7,000,000 common units in June 2015 to acquire 7,000,000 Carlyle Holdings partnership units from certain limited partners of Carlyle Holdings.\nThe total units as of December 31, 2015 as shown above exclude approximately 0.9 million common units in connection with the vesting of deferred restricted common units and an exchange of Carlyle Holdings partnership units that will participate in the unitholder distribution that will be paid in March 2016.\nThe Carlyle Group L.P. common units issued during the period from December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2014 relate to: (i) the Partnership using the net cash proceeds from the issuance of 4,500,000 common units in March 2014 to acquire 4,500,000 newly issued Carlyle Holdings partnership units, (ii) the vesting of the Partnership's deferred restricted common units during the year ended December 31, 2014, (iii) the acquisition of DGAM in February 2014, and (iv) the satisfaction of certain performance-vesting contingent consideration arrangements related to our acquisition of Metropolitan. Further, the Carlyle Group L.P. common units in the table above includes 716,404 common units that the Partnership is expected to acquire from Carlyle Holdings in future periods upon the vesting of certain of the Partnership's unvested common units associated with the acquisition of the remaining 40% equity interest in AlpInvest in August 2013.\nThe Carlyle Holdings partnership units issued to other limited partners during the period from December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2014 were issued to the sellers of Claren Road and Metropolitan as a result of the satisfaction of certain performance-vesting contingent consideration arrangements related to the acquisitions of Claren Road and Metropolitan. The Carlyle Holdings partnership units forfeited during the period from December 31, 2013 through December 31, 2014 relate to unvested Carlyle Holdings partnership units that were forfeited when the holder ceased to provide services to the Partnership. The Carlyle Holdings partnership units exchanged relate primarily to the Partnership's use of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of 9,300,000 common units in March 2014 to acquire 9,300,000 Carlyle Holdings partnership units from the other limited partners of Carlyle Holdings.\nThe total units as of December 31, 2014 as shown above exclude approximately 1.1 million common units in connection with the vesting of deferred restricted common units, an exchange of Carlyle Holdings partnership units held by NGP, and an acquisition earnout that participated in the unitholder distribution that was paid in March 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The Partnership consolidates all entities that it controls through a majority voting interest or otherwise. In addition, the accompanying consolidated financial statements consolidate: (1) Carlyle-affiliated funds and co-investment entities for which the Partnership is the sole general partner and the presumption of control by the general partner has not been overcome and (2) variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d), including certain CLOs and a real estate development company, for which the Partnership is deemed to be the primary beneficiary; consolidation of these entities is a requirement under U.S. GAAP. All significant inter-entity transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nFor entities that are determined to be VIEs, the Partnership consolidates those entities where it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. An entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest is defined as (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's business and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The consolidation rules require an analysis to (a) determine whether an entity in which the Partnership holds a variable interest is a VIE and (b) whether the Partnership's involvement, through holding interests directly or indirectly in the entity or contractually through other variable interests (e.g., management and performance related fees), would give it a controlling financial interest. In evaluating whether the Partnership is the primary beneficiary, the Partnership evaluates its economic interests in the entity held either directly or indirectly by the Partnership. The consolidation analysis is generally performed qualitatively. This consolidation analysis, which requires judgment, is performed at each reporting date.\nAccounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2010-10, Amendments for Certain Investment Funds, defers the application of the revised consolidation rules for a reporting enterprise's interest in an entity if certain conditions are met, including if the entity has the attributes of an investment company and is not a securitization or asset-backed financing entity. An entity that qualifies for the deferral will continue to be assessed for consolidation under the overall guidance on VIEs, before its amendment, and other applicable consolidation guidance.\nWhere VIEs have qualified for the deferral of the revised consolidation guidance, the analysis is based on previously existing consolidation guidance pursuant to U.S. GAAP. Generally, with the exception of the CLOs, our funds qualify for the deferral of the revised consolidation rules under which the primary beneficiary is the entity that absorbs a majority of the expected losses of the VIE or a majority of the expected residual returns of the VIE, or both. We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary at the time we first become involved with a VIE and subsequently reconsider that we are the primary beneficiary based on certain events. The evaluation of whether a fund is a VIE is subject to the requirements of ASC 810-10, originally issued as FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), and the determination of whether we should consolidate such VIE requires judgment. These judgments include whether the equity investment at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support; evaluating whether the equity holders, as a group, can make decisions that have a significant effect on the success of the entity; determining whether two or more parties' equity interests should be aggregated; determining whether the equity investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations to absorb losses or rights to receive returns from an entity; evaluating the nature of relationships and activities of the parties involved in determining which party within a related-party group is most closely associated with a VIE; and estimating cash flows in evaluating which member within the equity group absorbs a majority of the expected losses and hence would be deemed the primary beneficiary.\nFor all Carlyle-affiliated funds and co-investment entities (collectively the funds\u201d) that are not determined to be VIEs, the Partnership consolidates those funds where, as the sole general partner, it has not overcome the presumption of control pursuant to U.S. GAAP. Most Carlyle funds provide a dissolution right upon a simple majority vote of the non-Carlyle affiliated limited partners such that the presumption of control by Carlyle is overcome. Accordingly, these funds are not consolidated in the Partnership's consolidated financial statements.\nThe assets of the Consolidated Funds are classified principally within investments of Consolidated Funds; the liabilities of the Consolidate Funds are classified principally within loan payable of Consolidated Funds. The assets and liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are generally within separate legal entities. Therefore, the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are non-recourse to us and our general creditors. On January 1, 2016, the Partnership adopted new consolidation guidance which will reduce the number of funds consolidated by the Partnership on January 1, 2016. As a result, the assets and liabilities of Consolidated Funds will decrease. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nPerformance Fees. Performance fees consist principally of the allocation of profits from certain of the funds to which the Partnership is entitled (commonly known as carried interest). The Partnership is generally entitled to a 20% allocation (or 10% to 20% on external coinvestment vehicles, with some earning no carried interest, or approximately 2% to 10% in the case of most of the Partnership's fund of funds vehicles) of the net realized income or gain as a carried interest after returning the invested capital, the allocation of preferred returns of generally 8% to 9% and return of certain fund costs (generally subject to catch-up provisions as set forth in the fund limited partnership agreement) from its corporate private equity and real assets funds and closed-end carry funds in the global market strategies segment. Carried interest is recognized upon appreciation of the funds' investment values above certain return hurdles set forth in each respective partnership agreement. The Partnership recognizes revenues attributable to performance fees based upon the amount that would be due pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were terminated at that date. Accordingly, the amount recognized as performance fees reflects the Partnership's share of the gains and losses of the associated funds' underlying investments measured at their then-current fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. Because of the inherent uncertainty, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material.\nCarried interest is ultimately realized when: (i) an underlying investment is profitably disposed of, (ii) certain costs borne by the limited partner investors have been reimbursed, (iii) the fund's cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return and (iv) the Partnership has decided to collect carry rather than return additional capital to limited partner investors. Realized carried interest may be required to be returned by the Partnership in future periods if the funds' investment values decline below certain levels. When the fair value of a fund's investments remains constant or falls below certain return hurdles, previously recognized performance fees are reversed. In all cases, each fund is considered separately in this regard, and for a given fund, performance fees can never be negative over the life of a fund. If upon a hypothetical liquidation of a fund's investments at their then-current fair values, previously recognized and distributed carried interest would be required to be returned, a liability is established for the potential giveback obligation. For any given period, carried interest income could thus be negative; however, cumulative performance fees can never be negative over the life of a fund. If upon a hypothetical liquidation of a fund's investments at their then-current fair values, previously recognized and distributed carried interest would be required to be returned, a liability is established for the potential giveback obligation. Senior Carlyle professionals and employees who have received distributions of carried interest which are ultimately returned are contractually obligated to reimburse us for the amount returned. We record a receivable from current and former employees and our current and former senior Carlyle professionals for their individual portion of any giveback obligation that we establish. These receivables are included in due from affiliates and other receivables, net in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe timing of receipt of carried interest in respect of investments of our carry funds is dictated by the terms of the partnership agreements that govern such funds, which generally allow for carried interest distributions in respect of an investment upon a realization event after satisfaction of obligations relating to the return of capital, any realized losses, applicable fees and expenses and the applicable annual preferred limited partner return. Distributions to eligible senior Carlyle professionals in respect of such carried interest are generally made shortly thereafter. The giveback obligation, if any, in respect of previously realized carried interest is generally determined and due upon the winding up or liquidation of a carry fund pursuant to the terms of the fund's partnership agreement.\nIn addition to its performance fees from its corporate private equity and real assets funds and closed-end carry funds in the global market strategies segment, the Partnership is also entitled to receive performance fees from certain of its global market strategies funds and investment solutions fund of funds vehicles when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. Our hedge funds generally pay annual incentive fees or allocations equal to 20% of the fund's profits for the year, subject to a high-water mark. The high-water mark is the highest historical net asset value attributable to a fund investor's account on which incentive fees were paid and means that we will not earn incentive fees with respect to such fund investor for a year if the net asset value of such investor's account at the end of the year is lower that year than any prior year net asset value or the net asset value at the date of such fund investor's investment, generally excluding any contributions and redemptions for purposes of calculating net asset value. In these arrangements, incentive fees are recognized when the performance benchmark has been achieved based on the hedge funds' then-current fair value. These incentive fees are a component of performance fees in our consolidated financial statements and are treated as accrued until paid to us.\nPerformance Fee Related Compensation. A portion of the performance fees earned is due to employees and advisors of the Partnership. These amounts are accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction with the recognition of the related performance fee revenue and, until paid, are recognized as a component of the accrued compensation and benefits liability. Accordingly, upon any reversal of performance fee revenue, the related compensation expense is also reversed.\nIncome Taxes. Certain of the wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Partnership and the Carlyle Holdings partnerships are subject to federal, state, local and foreign corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provision attributable to the Partnership's share of this income is reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Based on applicable federal, foreign, state and local tax laws, the Partnership records a provision for income taxes for certain entities. Tax positions taken by the Partnership are subject to periodic audit by U.S. federal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities.\nThe Partnership accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740\u201d) requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the period in which the difference is expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period of the change in the provision for income taxes. Further, deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected realization of available net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. A valuation allowance is recorded on the Partnership's gross deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized. When evaluating the realizability of the Partnership's deferred tax assets, all evidence, both positive and negative, is evaluated. Items considered in this analysis include the ability to carry back losses, the reversal of temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and expectations of future earnings.\nUnder U.S. GAAP for income taxes, the amount of tax benefit to be recognized is the amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The Partnership analyzes its tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, the Partnership determines that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a liability is established, which is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The Partnership recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in the provision for income taxes. If recognized, the entire amount of unrecognized tax positions would be recorded as a reduction in the provision for income taxes.\nFair Value Measurement. U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which ranks the observability of market price inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices, or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets, will generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.\nFinancial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:\nLevel I - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical instruments as of the reporting date. The type of financial instruments included in Level I include unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in active markets. The Partnership does not adjust the quoted price for these instruments, even in situations where the Partnership holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.\nLevel II - inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. The type of financial instruments in this category includes less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs. Investments in hedge funds are classified in this category when their net asset value is redeemable without significant restriction.\nLevel III - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments that are included in this category include investments in privately-held entities, non-investment grade residual interests in securitizations, collateralized loan obligations, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs. Investments in fund of funds are generally included in this category.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the determination of which category within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate for any given financial instrument is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Partnership's assessment of the\nsignificance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.\nIn certain cases, debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices, market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments.\nInvestment professionals with responsibility for the underlying investments are responsible for preparing the investment valuations pursuant to the policies, methodologies and templates prepared by the Partnership's valuation group, which is a team made up of dedicated valuation professionals reporting to the Partnership's chief accounting officer. The valuation group is responsible for maintaining the Partnership's valuation policy and related guidance, templates and systems that are designed to be consistent with the guidance found in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. These valuations, inputs and preliminary conclusions are reviewed by the fund accounting teams. The valuations are then reviewed and approved by the respective fund valuation subcommittees, which are comprised of the respective fund head(s), segment head, chief financial officer and chief accounting officer, as well as members of the valuation group. The valuation group compiles the aggregate results and significant matters and presents them for review and approval by the global valuation committee, which is comprised of the Partnership's co-chief executive officers, president and chief operating officer, chief risk officer, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer, deputy chief investment officers for Corporate Private Equity, the business segment heads, and observed by the chief compliance officer, the director of internal audit and the Partnership's audit committee. Additionally, each quarter a sample of valuations are reviewed by external valuation firms.\nIn the absence of observable market prices, the Partnership values its investments using valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis. For some investments little market activity may exist. Management's determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks. Investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity of operating companies and real estate properties, and certain debt positions. The valuation technique for each of these investments is described below:\nPrivate Equity and Real Estate Investments - The fair values of private equity investments are determined by reference to projected net earnings, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), the discounted cash flow method, public market or private transactions, valuations for comparable companies or sales of comparable assets, and other measures which, in many cases, are unaudited at the time received. The methods used to estimate the fair value of real estate investments include the discounted cash flow method and/or capitalization rate ( cap rate\u201d) analysis. Valuations may be derived by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies or transactions (e.g., applying a key performance metric of the investment such as EBITDA or net operating income to a relevant valuation multiple or cap rate observed in the range of comparable companies or transactions), adjusted by management for differences between the investment and the referenced comparables, and in some instances by reference to option pricing models or other similar models. Adjustments to observable valuation measures are frequently made upon the initial investment to calibrate the initial investment valuation to industry observable inputs. Such adjustments are made to align the investment to observable industry inputs for differences in size, profitability, projected growth rates, geography and capital structure if applicable. The adjustments are reviewed with each subsequent valuation to assess how the investment has evolved relative to the observable inputs. Additionally, the investment may be subject to certain specific risks and/or development milestones which are also taken into account in the valuation assessment. Option pricing models and similar tools do not currently drive a significant portion of private equity or real estate valuations and are used primarily to value warrants, derivatives, certain restrictions and other atypical investment instruments.\nCredit-Oriented Investments - The fair values of credit-oriented investments are generally determined on the basis of prices between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices, market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments. Specifically, for investments in distressed debt and corporate loans and bonds, the fair values are generally determined by valuations of comparable investments. In some instances, the Partnership may utilize other valuation techniques, including the discounted cash flow method.\nCLO Investments and CLO Loans Payable - The Partnership has elected the fair value option to measure the loans payable of the CLOs at fair value, as the Partnership has determined that measurement of the loans payable issued by the CLOs at fair value better correlates with the value of the assets held by the CLOs, which are held to provide the cash flows for the note obligations. The investments of the CLOs are also carried at fair value.\nThe fair values of the CLO loan and bond assets are primarily based on quotations from reputable dealers or relevant pricing services. In situations where valuation quotations are unavailable, the assets are valued based on similar securities, market index changes, and other factors. The Partnership corroborates quotations from pricing services either with other available pricing data or with its own models. Generally, the loan and bond assets of the CLOs are not actively traded and are classified as Level III.\nThe fair values of the CLO loans payable and the CLO structured asset positions are determined based on both discounted cash flow analyses and third-party quotes. Those analyses consider the position size, liquidity, current financial condition of the CLOs, the third-party financing environment, reinvestment rates, recovery lags, discount rates, and default forecasts and are compared to broker quotations from market makers and third party dealers.\nLoans Payable of a Consolidated Real Estate VIE - The Partnership has elected the fair value option to measure the loans payable of a consolidated real estate VIE at fair value. The fair values of the loans are primarily based on discounted cash flows analyses, which consider the liquidity and current financial condition of the consolidated real estate VIE. These loans are classified as Level III.\nFund Investments - The Partnership's investments in external funds are valued based on its proportionate share of the net assets provided by the third party general partners of the underlying fund partnerships based on the most recent available information which typically has a lag of up to 90 days. The terms of the investments generally preclude the ability to redeem the investment. Distributions from these investments will be received as the underlying assets in the funds are liquidated, the timing of which cannot be readily determined.\nInvestments include (i) our ownership interests (typically general partner interest) in the funds, (ii) the investments held by the Consolidated Funds, (iii) strategic investments made by us, and (iv) certain credit-oriented investments. The valuation procedures utilized for investments of the funds vary depending on the nature of the investment. The fair value of investments in publicly traded securities is based on the closing price of the security with adjustments to reflect appropriate discounts if the securities are subject to restrictions. Upon the sale of a security, the realized net gain or loss is computed on a weighted average cost basis.\nThe valuation methodologies described above can involve subjective judgments, and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may be incorrect, which could result in the misstatement of fund performance and accrued performance fees. Because there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of, illiquid investments, the fair values of such investments as reflected in an investment fund's net asset value do not necessarily reflect the prices that would be obtained by us on behalf of the investment fund when such investments are realized. Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in prior fund net asset values would result in reduced earnings or losses for the applicable fund, the loss of potential carried interest and incentive fees and in the case of our hedge funds, management fees. Changes in values attributed to investments from quarter to quarter may result in volatility in the net asset values and results of operations that we report from period to period. Also, a situation where asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in prior fund net asset values could cause investors to lose confidence in us, which could in turn result in difficulty in raising additional funds. See Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Company - Valuation methodologies for certain assets in our funds can involve subjective judgments, and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may be incorrect, which could result in the misstatement of fund performance and accrued performance fees.\u201d\nEquity-Method Investments. The Partnership accounts for all investments in which it has or is otherwise presumed to have significant influence, including investments in the unconsolidated Funds and strategic investments, using the equity method of accounting. The carrying value of equity-method investments is determined based on amounts invested by the Partnership, adjusted for the equity in earnings or losses of the investee allocated based on the respective partnership agreement, less distributions received. The Partnership evaluates its equity-method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may not be recoverable.\nEquity-based Compensation. Compensation expense relating to the issuance of equity-based awards to Carlyle employees is measured at fair value on the grant date. The compensation expense for awards that vest over a future service period is recognized over the relevant service period on a straight-line basis, adjusted for estimated forfeitures of awards that are not expected to vest. The compensation expense for awards that do not require future service is recognized immediately. Upon the end of the service period, compensation expense is adjusted to account for the actual forfeiture rate. Cash settled equity-based awards are classified as liabilities and are re-measured at the end of each reporting period. The compensation expense for awards that contain performance conditions is recognized when it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved; in certain instances, such compensation expense may be recognized prior to the grant date of the award.\nEquity-based awards issued to non-employees are recognized as general, administrative and other expenses. The grant-date fair value of equity-based awards granted to Carlyle's non-employee directors is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The cost of services received in exchange for an equity-based award issued to non-employees who are not directors is measured at each vesting date, and is not measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award unless the award is vested at the grant date. Equity-based awards that require the satisfaction of future service criteria are recognized over the relevant service period, adjusted for estimated forfeitures of awards that are not expected to vest, based on the fair value of the award on each reporting date and adjusted for the actual fair value of the award at each vesting date. Accordingly, the measured value of the award will not be finalized until the vesting date.\nIn determining the aggregate fair value of any award grants, we make judgments, among others, as to the grant-date fair value and estimated forfeiture rates. Each of these elements, particularly the forfeiture assumptions used in valuing our equity awards, are subject to significant judgment and variability and the impact of changes in such elements on equity-based compensation expense could be material.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill. The Partnership's intangible assets consist of acquired contractual rights to earn future fee income, including management and advisory fees, customer relationships, and acquired trademarks. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from five to ten years, and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The Partnership's intangible assets include acquired contractual rights for fee income related to open-ended funds. Open-ended funds are subject to redemptions on a quarterly or more frequent basis and investors can generally decide to exit their fund investments at any time. The resulting inherent volatility in fee income derived from these contractual rights increases the degree of judgment and estimates used by management in evaluating such intangible assets for impairment. Actual results could differ from management's estimates and assumptions and such differences could result in a material impairment.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the identifiable net assets of businesses acquired and is recorded in the functional currency of the acquired entity. Goodwill is recognized as an asset and is reviewed for impairment annually as of October 1 and between annual tests when events and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe discuss the recent accounting pronouncements in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Carlyle Group L.P. (the Partnership\u201d) is a Delaware limited partnership formed on July 18, 2011. The Partnership is a holding partnership and its sole material assets are equity interests through wholly owned subsidiary entities representing partnership units in Carlyle Holdings I L.P., Carlyle Holdings II L.P. and Carlyle Holdings III L.P. (collectively,\u201d Carlyle Holdings\u201d). Through wholly owned subsidiary entities, the Partnership is the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings and operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Carlyle Holdings and, through Carlyle Holdings and its subsidiaries, continues to conduct the business now conducted by these subsidiaries. Carlyle Group Management L.L.C. is the general partner of the Partnership.\nAs the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings, the Partnership consolidates the financial position and results of operations of Carlyle Holdings into its financial statements, and the ownership interests of the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships are reflected as a non-controlling interest in the Partnership's financial statements.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe conduct our operations through four reportable segments: Corporate Private Equity, Global Market Strategies, Real Assets and Investment Solutions.\n \u2022 Corporate Private Equity - Our Corporate Private Equity segment advises our 22 buyout and 10 growth capital funds, which seek a wide variety of investments of different sizes and growth potentials. As of December 31, 2015, our Corporate Private Equity segment had approximately $63 billion in AUM and approximately $41 billion in Fee-earning AUM. \n \u2022 Global Market Strategies - Our Global Market Strategies segment advises a group of 68 funds that pursue investment opportunities across structured credit, distressed debt, corporate and energy mezzanine debt, middle-market and senior debt, as well as credit, emerging markets and commodities-focused hedge funds and a mutual fund. As of December 31, 2015, our Global Market Strategies segment had approximately $35 billion in AUM and approximately $31 billion in Fee-earning AUM. \n \u2022 Real Assets - Our Real Assets segment advises our eight U.S. and internationally focused real estate funds, our infrastructure fund, our two power funds, our international energy fund, as well as our five Legacy Energy funds (funds that we jointly advise with Riverstone). The segment also includes six NGP management fee funds and three carry funds advised by NGP. As of December 31, 2015, our Real Assets segment had approximately $38 billion in AUM and approximately $31 billion in Fee-earning AUM. \n \u2022 Investment Solutions - Our Investment Solutions segment advises a global private equity fund of funds program and related co-investment and secondary activities across 118 fund of funds vehicles. As of December 31, 2015, our Investment Solutions segment had approximately $46 billion in AUM and approximately $28 billion in Fee-earning AUM.  We earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds. We also typically receive a performance fee from an investment fund, which may be either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income, which we refer to as a carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), we are required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we advise. However, for segment reporting purposes, we present revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these investment funds. Accordingly, our segment revenues primarily consist of fund management and related advisory fees, performance fees (consisting of incentive fees and carried interest allocations), investment income, including realized and unrealized gains on our investments in our funds and other trading securities, as well as interest and other income. Our segment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits expenses, including salaries, bonuses, performance payment arrangements, and equity-based compensation excluding awards granted in our initial public offering or in connection with acquisitions and strategic investments, and general and administrative expenses. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the differences between our financial results reported pursuant to U.S. GAAP and our financial results for segment reporting purposes.\nTrends Affecting our Business\nOur results of operations, particularly our quarterly results, are affected by a variety of factors, including global economic, market and financial conditions, particularly in the United States, Europe and Asia. In general, a climate of stable interest rates and liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provides a positive environment for us to invest, develop and exit investments in our carry funds at attractive returns. Periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets also can present us with significant opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future revenue growth. For our hedge funds, opportunities to generate revenue depend on their respective investment strategies, certain of which may benefit from higher market volatility, including strategies targeted at capitalizing on low levels of correlation in equity and debt markets, differences in market prices versus fundamental value and trading inefficiencies. While our business is subject to global economic and market factors, we believe that our diversified, multi-product global platform, which invests across numerous industries, asset classes and geographies, enhances the stability of our management fee revenues and distributable earnings over the long term. Our diversified platform mitigates our exposure to a negative event associated with any specific fund, investment or vintage. Whether in stable or more volatile economic conditions, of critical importance to the success of our investments is the quality of our management teams as they actively work to monitor shifts in economic conditions and their impact on our investments.\nThe increase in financial market volatility observed over the course of 2015 and into the beginning of 2016 generally is attributable to three primary and interrelated factors: concerns regarding the economic climate in China, crude oil prices and the availability of credit. In China, there has been a significant slowdown in the industrial sector. As China accounts for nearly 25% of global manufacturing output and is a key link in global supply chains, a slowdown in China's industrial sector has a direct negative impact on global industrial orders. At the same time, the decline in Chinese demand for industrial inputs has contributed to a reduction in the capital spending of global businesses operating in the energy, metals, and mining industries because low commodity prices generally do not support new capital investment in businesses in these industries. The industrial sector of the U.S. economy is also contracting as a result of the significant reduction in energy-related capital spending. In January 2016, the Federal Reserve announced that its industrial production index declined by 0.4% in December, resulting in a full-year decline of 1.8%, the first 12-month decline in U.S. industrial output since 2009. Energy accounted for 70% of U.S. net industrial investment between 2009 and 2014 so with energy-related orders falling by 30%, many manufacturers are reporting their worst numbers since 2009.\nThe uncertainty around crude oil prices has also contributed to the increasingly uncertain investment environment and has had spillover effects across the chain of energy production, transmission, storage and consumption and has also affected the credit markets. Losses on energy related credit transactions have caused lenders, particularly in the U.S., to exercise caution in extending credit in all sectors, which has caused a tightening of credit availability for our transactions. We have not seen the same level of credit contraction in Europe and Asia and have remained quite active in those markets. In 2015, our European buyout and growth funds invested $1.0 billion in 14 transactions and our Asia buyout and growth funds and Japan buyout funds invested $1.4 billion in 13 transactions and closed 4 initial public offerings. As of December 31, 2015, we had capital available for investment through our carry funds of $44 billion. In 2015, we invested approximately $8.8 billion in new and existing investments across our carry fund portfolio, which is slightly less than our average over the last five years of $9.5 billion. Given increased competition for investments, and the effect, particularly in Europe and Asia, of the strong dollar against foreign currencies, the internal rates of return we are able to generate may be lower than our historical rates, but we continue to follow our core investment tenets and disciplined approach to make investments where we believe we can create value and achieve appreciation. We have a long-term investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year.\nThe confluence of effects from economic conditions in China, crude prices and tightening credit markets and the resulting market volatility, particularly at the beginning of 2016, also negatively impacted the value of our public portfolio, which accounts for approximately 26% of our total carry fund portfolio as of December 31, 2015. While changing valuations do not have a cash impact on our business until the investment is realized, they are reflected in the quarterly valuations of our portfolio and can adversely impact our quarterly GAAP earnings. Volatility and the corresponding heightened market uncertainty may also impact our ability to execute block trades and pursue initial public offerings as an exit strategy for our privately held portfolio companies. However, while in 2015 global IPO issuances were down 47% year-over-year on a proceeds basis and were at the lowest levels since 2009, our funds completed seven initial public offerings in 2015 as compared to six in 2014.\nRecent Transactions\nIn February 2016, the Board of Directors of our general partner declared a distribution of $0.29 per common unit to common unitholders in respect of the fourth quarter of 2015 payable on March 2, 2016 to holders of record of common units at the close of business on February 23, 2016.\nIn February 2016, the Board of Directors of the general partner of the Partnership authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of common units and/or Carlyle Holdings units. Under this unit repurchase program, units may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. We expect that the majority of repurchases under this program will be done via open market transactions. No units will be repurchased from our executive officers under this program. The timing and actual number of common units and/or Carlyle Holdings units repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price, and economic and market conditions. This unit repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date.\nKey Financial Measures\nOur key financial measures are discussed in the following pages.\nRevenues\nRevenues primarily consist of fund management fees, performance fees, investment income, including realized and unrealized gains of our investments in our funds and other trading securities, as well as interest and other income. See - Critical Accounting Policies - Performance Fees\u201d and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the manner in which management fees and performance fees are generated.\nFund Management Fees. Fund management fees include (i) management fees and (ii) transaction and portfolio advisory fees. Management fees are fees we earn for advisory services we provide to funds in which we hold a general partner interest or with which we have an investment advisory or investment management agreement. Management fees are based on (a) third parties' capital commitments to our investment funds, (b) third parties' remaining capital invested in our investment funds at cost or at the lower of cost or aggregate remaining fair value, (c) gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, (d) for the private equity and real estate fund of funds vehicles following the expiration of the commitment period or weighted-average investment period of such vehicles, the lower of cost or fair value of the capital invested, the net asset value for unrealized investments, or the contributions for unrealized investments, (e) the total par amount of assets for our CLOs and the aggregate principal amount of the notes of our other structured products, or (f) the net asset value ( NAV\u201d) of certain of our investment funds, as described in our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, management fees include catch-up management fees, which are episodic in nature and represent management fees charged to fund investors in subsequent closings of a fund which apply to the time period between the fee initiation date and the subsequent closing date.\nManagement fees for funds in our corporate private equity funds, closed-end carry funds in the global market strategies segment and real assets funds generally range from 1% to 2% of commitments during the investment period of the relevant fund. Large funds tend to have lower effective management fee rates, while smaller funds tend to have effective management fee rates approaching 2.0%. Following the expiration or termination of the investment period of such funds, the management fees generally step-down to between 0.6% and 2.0% generally on the lower of cost or fair value of capital invested; however, certain of our managed accounts base management fees at all times on contributions for unrealized investments or the current value of the investment. Depending upon the contracted terms of investment advisory or investment management and related agreements, these fees are called semiannually in advance and are recognized as earned over the subsequent six month period. As a result, cash on hand and deferred revenue will generally be higher at or around January and July, which are the semiannual due dates for management fees.\nManagement fees for our private equity and real estate fund of funds vehicles generally range from 0.3% to 1.0% on the vehicle's capital commitments during the commitment fee period of the relevant fund or the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds. Following the expiration of the commitment fee period or weighted-average investment period of such funds, the management fees generally range from 0.3% to 1.0% on the lower of cost or fair value of the capital invested, the NAV for unrealized investments, or the contributions for unrealized investments. The management fees for our fund of hedge funds vehicles generally range 0.2% to 1.5% of NAV. Management fees for our Investment Solutions segment are generally due quarterly and are recognized over the related quarter.\nOur hedge funds generally pay management fees quarterly that range from 1.5% to 2.0% of NAV per year. Management fees for our business development companies are due quarterly in arrears at annual rates that range from 0.25% to 1.0% of gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents. Management fees for our CLOs and other structured products typically range from 0.15% to 1.0% on the total par amount of assets or the aggregate principal amount of the notes in the CLO and are due quarterly or semiannually based on the terms and recognized over the relevant period. Our management fees for our CLOs/structured products and credit opportunities funds are governed by indentures and collateral management agreements.\nWith respect to Claren Road and ESG, we retain a specified percentage of the management fees of the businesses based on our economic ownership in the management companies of 55%. Through the second quarter of 2015, we retained 55% of the management fees of Carlyle Commodity Management L.L.C. ( CCM\u201d or Carlyle Commodity Management\u201d, formerly Vermillion) based on our 55% economic interest in Carlyle Commodity Management. Effective July 1, 2015, based on a restructuring of the original acquisition agreements of Carlyle Commodity Management, in which the Partnership's economic interest increased to approximately 83%, we are entitled to approximately 83% of the management fees of Carlyle Commodity Management. Management fees are not subject to repayment but may be offset to the extent that other fees are earned as described below under -Transaction and Portfolio Advisory Fee.\u201d\nManagement fees attributable to Carlyle Partners VI, L.P. ( CP VI\u201d), our sixth U.S. buyout fund with approximately $12.0 billion of Fee-earning AUM as of December 31, 2015, were approximately 15% and 14% of total management fees recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management fees attributable to Carlyle Partners V, L.P. ( CP V\u201d), our fifth U.S. buyout fund, were approximately 11% of total management fees recognized during the year ended December 31, 2013. No other fund generated over 10% of total management fees in the periods presented.\nFund management fees exclude the reimbursement of any partnership expenses paid by the Partnership on behalf of the Carlyle funds pursuant to the limited partnership agreements, including amounts related to the pursuit of actual, proposed, or unconsummated investments, professional fees, expenses associated with the acquisition, holding and disposition of investments, and other fund administrative expenses.\nTransaction and Portfolio Advisory Fees. Transaction and portfolio advisory fees are fees we receive for the transaction and portfolio advisory services we provide to our portfolio companies. When covered by separate contractual agreements, we recognize transaction and portfolio advisory fees for these services when the service has been provided and collection is reasonably assured. We are required to offset our fund management fees earned by a percentage of the transaction and advisory fees earned, which we refer to as the rebate offsets.\u201d Such rebate offset percentages generally approximate 80% of the fund's portion of the transaction and advisory fees earned. The recognition of portfolio advisory fees and transaction fees can be volatile as they are primarily generated by investment activity within our funds, and therefore are impacted by our investment pace. We have received and expect to continue to receive requests from a variety of investors and groups representing investors to increase the percentage of transaction and advisory fees we share with our investors in future funds; to the extent that we accommodate such requests on future funds, the rebate offset percentages would increase relative to historical levels.\nPerformance Fees. Performance fees consist principally of the special residual allocation of profits to which we are entitled, commonly referred to as carried interest, from certain of our investment funds, which we refer to as the carry funds.\u201d We are generally entitled to a 20% allocation (or 10% to 20% on external coinvestment vehicles, with some earning no carried interest, or approximately 2% to 10% in the case of most of our fund of funds vehicles) of the net realized income or gain as a carried interest after returning the invested capital, the allocation of preferred returns of generally 8% to 9% and the return of certain fund costs (subject to catch-up provisions as set forth in the fund limited partnership agreement). Carried interest revenue, which is a component of performance fees in our consolidated financial statements, is recognized by Carlyle upon appreciation of the valuation of our funds' investments above certain return hurdles as set forth in each respective partnership agreement and is based on the amount that would be due to us pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were liquidated at such date. Accordingly, the amount of carried interest recognized as performance fees reflects our share of the fair value gains and losses of the associated funds' underlying investments measured at their then-current fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. As a result, the performance fees earned in an applicable reporting period are not indicative of any future period, as fair values are based on conditions prevalent as of the reporting date. Refer to - Trends Affecting our Business\u201d for further discussion. Carried interest is ultimately realized and distributed when: (i) an underlying investment is profitably disposed of, (ii) certain costs borne by the limited partner investors have been reimbursed, (iii) the investment fund's cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return and (iv) we have decided to collect carry rather than return additional capital to limited partner investors. Our decision to realize carry considers such factors as the level of embedded valuation gains, the portion of the fund invested, the portion of the fund returned to limited partner investors, and the length of time the fund has been in carry, as well as other qualitative measures. The portion of performance fees that are realized and unrealized in each period are separately reported in our statement of operations.\nUnder our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of AlpInvest, we generally do not retain any carried interest in respect of the historical investments and commitments to our fund of funds vehicles that existed as of July 1, 2011 (including any options to increase any such commitments exercised after such date). We are entitled to 15% of the carried interest in respect of commitments from the historical owners of AlpInvest for the period between 2011 and 2020 and 40% of the carried interest in respect of all other commitments (including all future commitments from third parties). In certain instances, carried interest associated with the fund of funds vehicles is subject to entity level income taxes in the Netherlands.\nOur performance fees are generated by a diverse set of funds with different vintages, geographic concentration, investment strategies and industry specialties. For an explanation of the fund acronyms used throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section, see Item 1. Business - Our Family of Funds.\u201d\nPerformance fees from Carlyle Europe Partners III, L.P. ( CEP III\u201d), Carlyle Asia Partners III ( CAP III\u201d), Carlyle Realty Partners VI, L.P. ( CRP VI\u201d), and Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy and Power Fund III, L.P. ( Energy III\u201d) (with total AUM of approximately $4.9 billion, $2.4 billion, $2.9 billion, and $0.5 billion, respectively) were $236.8 million, $184.5 million, $101.1 million, and $(100.3) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Performance fees from CP V and CEP III were $600.8 million and $584.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Performance fees from CP V, CEP III, and Carlyle Partners IV, L.P. ( CP IV\u201d), our fourth U.S. buyout fund, were $592.0 million, $509.1 million, and $390.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013. No other fund generated over 10% of performance fees in the periods presented.\nRealized carried interest may be clawed-back or given back to the fund if the fund's investment values decline below certain return hurdles, which vary from fund to fund. When the fair value of a fund's investments remains constant or falls below certain return hurdles, previously recognized performance fees are reversed. In all cases, each investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback obligations. For any given period, carried interest income could thus be negative; however, cumulative performance fees can never be negative over the life of a fund. In addition, we are not obligated to pay guaranteed returns or hurdles. If upon a hypothetical liquidation of a fund's investments at the then-current fair values, previously recognized and distributed carried interest would be required to be returned, a liability is established in our financial statements for the potential giveback obligation. As discussed below, each individual recipient of realized carried interest typically signs a guarantee agreement or partnership agreement that personally obligates such person to\nreturn his/her pro rata share of any amounts of realized carried interest previously distributed that are later clawed back. Accordingly, carried interest as performance fee compensation is subject to return to the Partnership in the event a giveback obligation is funded. Generally, the actual giveback liability, if any, does not become due until the end of a fund's life.\nIn addition to the carried interest from our carry funds, we are also entitled to receive incentive fees or allocations from certain of our Global Market Strategies funds when the return on AUM exceeds previous calendar-year ending or date-of-investment high-water marks. Our hedge funds generally pay annual incentive fees or allocations equal to 20% of the fund's profits for the year, subject to a high-water mark. The high-water mark is the highest historical NAV attributable to a fund investor's account on which incentive fees were paid and means that we will not earn incentive fees with respect to such fund investor for a year if the NAV of such investor's account at the end of the year is lower that year than any prior year-end NAV or the NAV at the date of such fund investor's investment, generally excluding any contributions and redemptions for purposes of calculating NAV. In these arrangements, incentive fees are recognized when the performance benchmark has been achieved based on the hedge funds' then-current fair value and are included in performance fees in our consolidated statements of operations. These incentive fees are a component of performance fees in our consolidated financial statements and are treated as accrued until paid to us.\nFor any given period, performance fee revenue on our statement of operations may include reversals of previously recognized performance fees due to a decrease in the value of a particular fund that results in a decrease of cumulative performance fees earned to date. Since fund return hurdles are cumulative, previously recognized performance fees also may be reversed in a period of appreciation that is lower than the particular fund's hurdle rate. For the years ended December 31, 2015 2014, and 2013, the reversals of performance fees were $253.4 million, $255.4 million, and $63.0 million, respectively.\nAdditionally, unrealized performance fees reverse when performance fees are realized and can be negative if the amount of realized performance fees exceed total performance fees generated in the period.\nAs of December 31, 2015, accrued performance fees and accrued giveback obligations were approximately $3.0 billion and $252.0 million, respectively, after amounts eliminated related to the Consolidated Funds. Each balance assumes a hypothetical liquidation of the funds' investments at December 31, 2015 at their then current fair values. These assets and liabilities will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the fair values of the fund investments until they are realized.\nIn addition, realized performance fees may be reversed in future periods to the extent that such amounts become subject to a giveback obligation. If at December 31, 2015, all investments held by our carry funds were deemed worthless, the amount of realized and previously distributed performance fees subject to potential giveback would be approximately $1.9 billion, on an after-tax basis where applicable. See the related discussion of Contingent Obligations (Giveback)\u201d within - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Since Carlyle's inception, we have repaid a total of approximately $53.9 million in\naggregate giveback obligations, which was funded primarily through collection of employee receivables related to giveback obligations and from non-controlling interests for their portion of the obligation.\nAs described above, each investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback obligations. As a result, performance fees within funds will continue to fluctuate primarily due to certain investments within each fund constituting a material portion of the carry in that fund. Additionally, the fair value of investments in our funds may have substantial fluctuations from period to period.\nIn addition, in our discussion of our non-GAAP results, we use the term net performance fees\u201d to refer to the performance fees from our funds net of the portion allocated to our investment professionals and certain tax expenses associated with carried interest attributable to certain partners and employees, which are reflected as performance fee related compensation expense. We use the term realized net performance fees\u201d to refer to realized performance fees from our funds, net of the portion allocated to our investment professionals and certain tax expenses associated with carried interest attributable to certain partners and employees, which are reflected as realized performance fee related compensation expense. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for the amount of realized and unrealized performance fees recognized each period. See - Segment Analysis\u201d for the realized and unrealized performance fees by segment and related discussion for each period.\nFair Value Measurement. U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which ranks the observability of market price inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices, or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets, will generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.\nFinancial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:\nLevel I - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical instruments as of the reporting date. The type of financial instruments included in Level I include unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in active markets. We do not adjust the quoted price for these instruments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.\nLevel II - inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. The type of financial instruments in this category includes less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs. Investments in hedge funds are classified in this category when their net asset value is redeemable without significant restriction.\nLevel III - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments that are included in this category include investments in privately-held entities, non-investment grade residual interests in securitizations, collateralized loan obligations, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs. Investments in fund of funds are generally included in this category.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the determination of which category within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate for any given financial instrument is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.\nThe table below summarizes the valuation of investments and other financial instruments included within our AUM, by segment and fair value hierarchy levels, as of December 31, 2015 (amounts in millions):\nTable 270: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Corporate\nPrivate\nEquity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Global\nMarket\nStrategies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Real Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Investment\nSolutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Results\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level I\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level II\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level III\n</td> <td>27,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Fair Value\n</td> <td>35,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Net Asset Value\n</td> <td>3,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(498\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(804\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total AUM, Excluding Available Capital Commitments\n</td> <td>38,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Available Capital Commitments\n</td> <td>24,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total AUM\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn certain cases, debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices, market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments.\nInvestment professionals with responsibility for the underlying investments are responsible for preparing the investment valuations pursuant to the policies, methodologies and templates prepared by our valuation group, which is a team made up of dedicated valuation professionals reporting to our chief accounting officer. The valuation group is responsible for maintaining our valuation policy and related guidance, templates and systems that are designed to be consistent with the guidance found in U.S. GAAP. These valuations, inputs and preliminary conclusions are reviewed by the fund accounting teams. The valuations are then reviewed and approved by the respective fund valuation subcommittees, which are comprised of the respective fund head(s), segment head, chief financial officer and chief accounting officer, as well as members from the valuation group. The valuation group compiles the aggregate results and significant matters and presents them for review and approval by the global valuation committee, which is comprised of our co-chief executive officers, president and chief operating officer, chief risk officer, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer, deputy chief investment officers for Corporate Private Equity, the business segment heads, and observed by the chief compliance officer, the director of internal audit, and our audit committee. Additionally, each quarter a sample of valuations is reviewed by external valuation firms.\nIn the absence of observable market prices, we value our investments using valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis. For some investments little market activity may exist. Management's determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks. Investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity of operating companies and real estate properties, and certain debt positions. The valuation technique for each of these investments is described in Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment Income, Interest, and Other Income. Investment income, interest, and other income represent the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our principal investments, including our investments in Carlyle funds that are not consolidated, our equity method investments and other principal investments, as well as any interest and other income. Investment income (loss) also includes the related amortization of the basis difference between the carrying value of our investment and our share of the underlying net assets of the investee, as well as the compensation expense associated with compensatory arrangements provided by us to employees of our equity method investee. Realized investment income (loss) is recorded when we redeem all or a portion of our investment or when we receive or are due cash income, such as dividends or distributions. A realized investment loss is also recorded when an investment is deemed to be worthless. Unrealized investment income (loss) results from changes in the fair value of the underlying investment, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains (losses) at the time an investment is realized.\nInterest and Other Income of Consolidated Funds. Interest and other income of Consolidated Funds primarily represents the interest earned on CLO assets. However, the Consolidated Funds are not the same entities in all periods presented and may change in future periods due to changes in U.S. GAAP, changes in fund terms and terminations of funds.\nRevenue of a Consolidated Real Estate VIE. Revenue of a consolidated real estate VIE consists of revenue generated by Urbplan, which primarily is revenue earned for land development services using the completed contract method and investment income earned on Urbplan's investments. Under the completed contract method of revenue recognition, revenue is not recognized until the period in which the land development services contract is completed.\nNet Investment Gains (Losses) of Consolidated Funds. Net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds measures the change in the difference in fair value between the assets and the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds. A gain (loss) indicates that the fair value of the assets of the Consolidated Funds appreciated more (less), or depreciated less (more), than the fair value of the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds. A gain or loss is not necessarily indicative of the investment performance of the Consolidated Funds and does not impact the management or incentive fees received by Carlyle for its management of the Consolidated Funds. The portion of the net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds attributable to the limited partner investors is allocated to non-controlling interests. Therefore a gain or loss is not expected to have a material impact on the revenues or profitability of the Partnership. Moreover, although the assets of the Consolidated Funds are consolidated onto our balance sheet pursuant to U.S. GAAP, ultimately we do not have recourse to such assets and such liabilities are generally non-recourse to us. Therefore, a gain or loss from the Consolidated Funds generally does not impact the assets available to our equity holders.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation includes salaries, bonuses, equity-based compensation, and performance payment arrangements. Bonuses are accrued over the service period to which they relate.\nWe recognize as compensation expense the portion of performance fees that are due to our employees, senior Carlyle professionals, and advisors in a manner consistent with how we recognize the performance fee revenue. These amounts are accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction with the related performance fee revenue and, until paid, are recognized as a component of the accrued compensation and benefits liability. Compensation in respect of performance fees is paid when the related performance fees are realized, and not when such performance fees are accrued. The funds do not have a uniform allocation of performance fees to our employees, senior Carlyle professionals and advisors. Therefore, for any given period, the ratio of performance fee compensation to performance fee revenue may vary based on the funds generating the performance fee revenue for that period and their particular allocation percentages.\nIn addition, we have implemented various equity-based compensation arrangements that require senior Carlyle professionals and other employees to vest ownership of a portion of their equity interests over a service period of up to 42 months, which under U.S. GAAP will result in compensation charges over current and future periods. Further, in order to recruit and retain existing and future senior Carlyle professionals and other employees, we have implemented additional equity-based compensation programs that have resulted in increases to our equity-based compensation expenses, which is a trend that may continue in the future if we increase the use of deferred restricted common units. For example, in February 2016, we granted approximately 5 million deferred restricted common units across a significant number of our employees for a total estimated grant-date fair value of approximately $58 million; these awards vest over a period of 18 to 42 months. Compensation charges associated with the equity-based compensation grants issued in our initial public offering in May 2012 or grants issued in acquisitions or strategic investments are excluded from our calculation of Economic Net Income. Compensation charges associated with all equity-based compensation grants are excluded from Fee Related Earnings and Distributable Earnings.\nWe may hire additional individuals and overall compensation levels may correspondingly increase, which could result in an increase in compensation and benefits expense. As a result of acquisitions, we have charges associated with contingent consideration taking the form of earn-outs and profit participation, some of which are reflected as compensation expense. Our fundraising has increased in recent periods and, as a result, our compensation expense increased in periods in which we closed on increased levels of new capital commitments. Amounts due to employees related to such fundraising will be expensed when earned even though the benefit of the new capital and related fees will be reflected in operations over the life of the related fund.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General, administrative, and other expenses include occupancy and equipment expenses and other expenses, which consist principally of professional fees, including those related to our global regulatory compliance program, external costs of fundraising, travel and related expenses, communications and information\nservices, depreciation and amortization (including intangible asset amortization and impairment) and foreign currency transactions. We expect that general, administrative and other expenses will vary due to infrequently occurring or unusual items. Over the last three years, our general, administrative and other expenses have been relatively consistent but for the impairment of intangible assets and expenses associated with litigation matters. Also, in periods of significant fundraising, to the extent that we use third parties to assist in our fundraising efforts, our general, administrative and other expenses may increase accordingly. Additionally, we anticipate that general, administrative and other expenses will fluctuate from period to period due to the impact of foreign exchange transactions.\nWe also could incur additional expenses in the future related to our acquisitions including amortization of acquired intangibles, earn-outs to equity holders and fair value adjustments on contingent consideration issued, as well as related to our global compliance efforts. As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, we evaluate our intangible assets (including goodwill) for impairment and could record additional impairment losses in future periods.\nInterest and Other Expenses of Consolidated Funds. The interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds consist primarily of interest expenses related primarily to our CLO loans, professional fees and other third-party expenses.\nInterest and Other Expenses of a Consolidated Real Estate VIE. Interest and other expenses of a consolidated real estate VIE reflect expenses incurred by Urbplan, consisting primarily of interest expense, general and administrative expenses, compensation and benefits, and costs associated with land development services. Also included in this caption is the change in our estimate of the fair value of Urbplan's loans payable during the period.\nIncome Taxes. The Carlyle Holdings partnerships and their subsidiaries primarily operate as pass-through entities for U.S. income tax purposes and record a provision for state and local income taxes for certain entities based on applicable laws and a provision for foreign income taxes for certain foreign entities. In addition, Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. is subject to additional entity-level taxes that are reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome taxes for foreign entities are accounted for using the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period in which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by federal and certain state, local and foreign tax regulators. As of December 31, 2015, our U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2012 through 2014 are open under the normal three-year statute of limitations and therefore subject to examination. State and local tax returns are generally subject to audit from 2011 to 2014. Foreign tax returns are generally subject to audit from 2008 to 2014. Certain of our affiliates are currently under audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.\nNon-controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities. Non-controlling interests in consolidated entities represent the component of equity in consolidated entities not held by us. These interests are adjusted for general partner allocations and by subscriptions and redemptions in hedge funds which occur during the reporting period. Non-controlling interests related to hedge funds are subject to quarterly or monthly redemption by investors in these funds following the expiration of a specified period of time or may be withdrawn subject to a redemption fee in the hedge funds during the period when capital may not be withdrawn. As limited partners in these types of funds have been granted redemption rights, amounts relating to third-party interests in such consolidated funds are presented as redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities within the consolidated balance sheets. When redeemable amounts become legally payable to investors, they are classified as a liability and included in other liabilities of Consolidated Funds in the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe record significant non-controlling interests in Carlyle Holdings relating to the ownership interests of the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. The Partnership, through wholly owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings. Accordingly, the Partnership consolidates the financial position and results of operations of Carlyle Holdings into its financial statements, and the other ownership interests in Carlyle Holdings are reflected as a non-controlling interest in the Partnership's financial statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEconomic Net Income. Economic net income or ENI,\u201d is a key performance benchmark used in our industry. ENI represents segment net income which includes certain tax expense associated with performance fee compensation and excludes the impact of all other income taxes, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, acquisition-related items including amortization and any impairment charges of acquired intangibles and contingent consideration taking the form of earn-outs, charges associated with equity-based compensation grants issued in May 2012 upon completion of the initial public offering or grants issued in acquisitions or strategic investments, corporate actions and infrequently occurring or unusual events. We believe the inclusion or exclusion of these items provides investors with a meaningful indication of our core operating performance. For segment reporting purposes, revenues and expenses, and accordingly segment net income, are presented on a basis that deconsolidates the Consolidated Funds. Total Segment ENI equals the aggregate of ENI for all segments. This measure supplements and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed further under Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nFee Related Earnings. Fee Related Earnings is a component of Economic Net Income and measures our operating profitability exclusive of performance fees, investment income from investments in our funds, performance fee-related compensation, equity-based compensation expense, and certain general, administrative and other expenses when the timing of any future payment is uncertain. Accordingly, Fee Related Earnings reflect the ability of the business to cover direct base compensation and operating expenses from fee revenues other than performance fees. Fee Related Earnings are reported as part of our segment results. We use Fee Related Earnings from operations to measure our profitability from fund management fees.\nDistributable Earnings. Distributable Earnings is FRE plus realized net performance fees and realized investment income. Distributable Earnings is intended to show the amount of net realized earnings without the effects of consolidation of the Consolidated Funds. Distributable Earnings is derived from our segment reported results and is an additional measure to assess performance and amounts potentially available for distribution from Carlyle Holdings to its unitholders. Distributable Earnings is evaluated regularly by management in making resource deployment decisions and in assessing performance of our four segments and for compensation. We believe that reporting Distributable Earnings is helpful to understanding our business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure that management uses to analyze our segment performance.\nOperating Metrics\nWe monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the alternative asset management industry.\nFee-earning Assets under Management\nFee-earning assets under management or Fee-earning AUM refers to the assets we manage or advise from which we derive recurring fund management fees. Our Fee-earning AUM generally equals the sum of:\n (a) for substantially all carry funds and certain co-investment vehicles where the original investment period has not expired, and for Metropolitan fund of funds vehicles during the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds, the amount of limited partner capital commitments, and for AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles, the amount of external investor capital commitments during the commitment fee period, and for the NGP management fee funds and certain carry funds advised by NGP, the amount of investor capital commitments before the first investment realization (see Fee-earning AUM based on capital commitments\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period); \n (b) for substantially all carry funds and certain co-investment vehicles where the original investment period has expired and for Metropolitan fund of funds vehicles after the expiration of the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds, the remaining amount of limited partner invested capital at cost, and for the NGP management fee funds and certain carry funds advised by NGP where the first investment has been realized, the amount of partner commitments less realized and written-off investments (see Fee-earning AUM based on invested capital\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period); \n (c) the amount of aggregate fee-earning collateral balance at par of our collateralized loan obligations ( CLOs\u201d), as defined in the fund indentures (typically exclusive of equities and defaulted positions) as of the quarterly cut-off date for each CLO, and the aggregate principal amount of the notes of our other structured products (see Fee-earning AUM based on collateral balances, at par\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period); \n (d) the net asset value of our mutual fund and the external investor portion of the net asset value (pre-redemptions and subscriptions) of our long/short credit funds, emerging markets, multi-product macroeconomic, fund of hedge funds vehicles and other hedge funds (see Fee-earning AUM based on net asset value\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period); \n (e) the gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage), excluding cash and cash equivalents of our business development companies and certain carry funds; and \n (f) for AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles where the commitment fee period has expired, and certain carry funds where the investment period has expired, the lower of cost or fair value of invested capital (see Fee-earning AUM based on lower of cost or fair value and other\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period).  The table below details Fee-earning AUM by its respective components at each period.\nTable 277: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Results\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of Fee-earning AUM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on capital commitments (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on invested capital (2)\n</td> <td>33,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on collateral balances, at par (3)\n</td> <td>17,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on net asset value (4)\n</td> <td>9,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on lower of cost or fair value and other (5)\n</td> <td>21,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, End of Period (6)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Reflects limited partner capital commitments where the original investment period, weighted-average investment period, or commitment fee period has not expired. Increases of $8.8 billion from December 31, 2014 are related primarily to fundraising in our Corporate Private Equity and Real Assets funds, offset by net changes from commitments to invested capital in our Investment Solutions funds and decreases from foreign exchange of $1.0 billion. \n (2) Reflects limited partner invested capital at cost and includes amounts committed to or reserved for investments for certain Real Assets and Investment Solutions funds. Decreases of $7.4 billion from December 31, 2014 are primarily related to large distributions for funds outside their original commitment periods in our Corporate Private Equity and Real Assets segments, along with decreases for foreign exchange of approximately $0.5 billion. \n (3) Represents the amount of aggregate Fee-earning collateral balances and principal balances, at par, for our CLOs/structured products. The overall increase of $0.3 billion from December 31, 2014 is related to fundraising of $4.6 billion for nine structured products. Fundraising was offset by decreases in the collateral balances, at par, of our structured products, in addition to decreases from foreign exchange of $0.6 billion. \n (4) Reflects the net asset value (pre-redemptions and subscriptions) of our hedge funds, mutual fund and fund of hedge funds vehicles. The decrease from December 31, 2014 of $5.3 billion was due to net redemptions and market depreciation in our hedge funds and fund of hedge fund vehicles of $4.5 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively. Our hedge fund partnerships had outstanding redemption requests for $3.1 billion in the aggregate as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. Also, as disclosed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we commenced a wind down of the operations of Diversified Global Asset Management in our Investment Solutions segment in the first quarter of 2016, which had approximately $2 billion of Fee-earning AUM as of December 31, 2015. \n (5) Includes funds with fees based on gross asset value. The decrease of $1.0 billion from December 31, 2014 was primarily related to foreign exchange decreases of $1.6 billion and distributions in our funds based on lower of cost or fair value in our Investment Solutions segment. \n (6) Energy II, Energy III, Energy IV, Renew I, and Renew II (collectively, the Legacy Energy Funds\u201d), are managed with Riverstone Holdings LLC and its affiliates. Affiliates of both Carlyle and Riverstone act as investment advisers to each of the Legacy Energy Funds. With the exception of Energy IV and Renew II, where Carlyle has a minority representation on the funds' management committees, management of each of the Legacy Energy Funds is vested in committees with equal representation by Carlyle and Riverstone, and the consent of representatives of both Carlyle and Riverstone is required for investment decisions. As of December 31, 2015, the Legacy Energy Funds had, in the aggregate, approximately $6.3 billion in AUM and $5.8 billion in Fee-earning AUM. We are no longer raising capital for the Legacy Energy Funds and expect these balances to continue to decrease over time as the funds wind down. \nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Fee-earning AUM.\nTable 284: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Results\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM Rollforward\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, Beginning of Period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inflows, including Commitments (1)\n</td> <td>22,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outflows, including Distributions (2)\n</td> <td>(18,940\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19,143\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,522\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscriptions, net of Redemptions (3)\n</td> <td>(4,528\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(277\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>959\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in CLO collateral balances (4)\n</td> <td>850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) (5)\n</td> <td>(1,147\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(957\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>988\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign Exchange and other (6)\n</td> <td>(3,771\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,666\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, End of Period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Inflows represent limited partner capital raised and capital invested by our carry funds, NGP management fee funds, and fund of funds vehicles outside the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period. Inflows do not include amounts raised of $4.5 billion for which fees have not yet commenced as of December 31, 2015. \n (2) Outflows represent limited partner distributions from our carry funds, NGP management fee funds, and fund of funds vehicles and changes in basis for our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has expired. \n (3) Represents the net result of subscriptions to and redemptions from our hedge funds, mutual fund and fund of hedge funds vehicles. Our hedge fund partnerships had outstanding redemption requests for $3.1 billion in the aggregate as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. Also, as disclosed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we commenced a wind down of the operations of Diversified Global Asset Management in our Investment Solutions segment in the first quarter of 2016, which had approximately $2 billion of Fee-earning AUM as of December 31, 2015. \n (4) Represents the change in the aggregate Fee-earning collateral balances at par of our CLOs/structured products, as of the quarterly cut-off dates. \n (5) Market Appreciation/ (Depreciation) represents changes in the net asset value of our hedge funds, mutual fund and fund of hedge funds vehicles, and realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles based on the lower of cost or fair value. \n (6) Includes activity of funds with fees based on gross asset value. Represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.  Refer to - Segment Analysis\u201d for a detailed discussion by segment of the activity affecting Fee-earning AUM for each of the periods presented by segment.\nAssets under Management\nAssets under management or AUM refers to the assets we manage or advise. Our AUM equals the sum of the following:\n (a) the fair value of the capital invested in Carlyle carry funds, co-investment vehicles, NGP management fee funds and fund of funds vehicles plus the capital that Carlyle is entitled to call from investors in those funds and vehicles (including Carlyle commitments to those funds and vehicles and those of senior Carlyle professionals and employees) pursuant to the terms of their capital commitments to those funds and vehicles; \n (b) the amount of aggregate collateral balance and principal cash at par or aggregate principal amount of the notes of our CLOs and other structured products (inclusive of all positions); \n (c) the net asset value (pre-redemptions and subscriptions) of our long/short credit, emerging markets, multi-product macroeconomic, fund of hedge funds vehicles, mutual fund and other hedge funds; and \n (d) the gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage) of our business development companies. \nOur carry funds are closed-ended funds and investors are generally not able to redeem their interests under the fund partnership agreements.\nWe include in our calculation of AUM and Fee-earning AUM certain energy and renewable resources funds that we jointly advise with Riverstone and certain NGP management fee funds and carry funds that are advised by NGP.\nFor our carry funds, co-investment vehicles, fund of funds vehicles, and NGP management fee funds, total AUM includes the fair value of the capital invested, whereas Fee-earning AUM includes the amount of capital commitments or the remaining amount of invested capital at cost, depending on whether the original investment period for the fund has expired. As such, Fee-earning AUM may be greater than total AUM when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is less than the cost of those investments.\nOur calculations of Fee-earning AUM and AUM may differ from the calculations of other alternative asset managers and, as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by others. In addition, our calculation of AUM includes uncalled commitments to, and the fair value of invested capital in, our funds from Carlyle and our personnel, regardless of whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to management or performance fees. Our calculations of Fee-earning AUM or AUM are not based on any definition of Fee-earning AUM or AUM that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage or advise.\nWe generally use Fee-earning AUM as a metric to measure changes in the assets from which we earn recurring management fees. Total AUM tends to be a better measure of our investment and fundraising performance as it reflects assets at fair value plus available uncalled capital.\nAvailable Capital\nAvailable capital, commonly known as dry powder,\u201d for our carry funds, fund of funds vehicles and NGP management fee funds refer to the amount of capital commitments available to be called for investments. Amounts previously called may be added back to available capital following certain distributions. Expired Available Capital\u201d occurs when a fund has passed the investment and follow-on periods and can no longer invest capital into new or existing deals. Any remaining Available Capital, typically a result of either recycled distributions or specific reserves established for the follow-on period that are not drawn, can only be called for fees and expenses and is therefore removed from the Total AUM calculation.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Available Capital and Fair Value of Capital, and the resulting rollforward of Total AUM.\nTable 295: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Equity invested amounts may vary from capital called due to timing differences between investment acquisition and capital call dates. \n (3) Represents distributions from our carry funds, NGP management fee funds and fund of funds vehicles, net of amounts recycled and distributions from our business development companies. Distributions are based on when proceeds are actually distributed to investors, which may differ from when they are realized. \n (4) Represents the net result of subscriptions to and redemptions from our hedge funds, mutual fund, and fund of hedge funds vehicles. Our hedge fund partnerships had outstanding redemption requests for $3.1 billion in the aggregate as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. Also, as disclosed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we commenced a wind down of the operations of Diversified Global Asset Management in our Investment Solutions segment in the first quarter of 2016, which had approximately $2 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2015. \n (5) Represents the change in the aggregate collateral balance and principal cash at par of the CLOs/structured products. \n (6) Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments and changes in the net asset value of our hedge funds, mutual fund, and fund of hedge funds vehicles. Appreciation for the fourth quarter was primarily driven by appreciation in the public portfolio of our carry funds of $1.0 billion (7%) which \nwas partially offset by depreciation in the private portfolio of our carry funds of $0.1 billion (0%). Remaining market appreciation for the fourth quarter of 2015 primarily relates to appreciation in our fund of funds vehicles of $0.8 billion, partially offset by depreciation on the NGP management fee funds of $0.7 billion. Appreciation for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by appreciation in the public portfolio of our carry funds of $2.4 billion (13%) and appreciation in the private portfolio of our carry funds of $1.2 billion (3%). Remaining market appreciation for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 primarily relates to the fund of funds vehicles ($7.7 billion), offset by depreciation on the NGP management fee funds ($1.5 billion) and hedge funds ($0.7 billion).\n (7) Represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds and other changes in AUM. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.  The table below presents the change in appreciation on portfolio investments of our carry funds.

The percentage of return is calculated as the sum of ending remaining investment fair market value (\"FMV\") and net investment outflow (sales proceeds less net purchases) less beginning remaining investment FMV divided by beginning remaining investment FMV. \n (3) Public portfolio includes initial public offerings (\"IPO\") that occurred in the quarter. Investments may be reported as private in quarters prior to the IPO quarter. \n (4) The MSCI ACWI - All Cap Index represents the performance of the MSCI All Country World Index across all market capitalization sizes of the global equity market. There are significant differences between the types of securities and assets typically acquired by our carry funds and the investments covered by the MSCI All Country World Index. Specifically, our carry funds may make investments in securities and other assets that have a greater degree of risk and volatility, and less liquidity, than those securities included in the MSCI All Country World Index. Moreover, investors in the securities included in the MSCI All Country World Index may not be subject to the management fees, carried interest or expenses to which investors in our carry funds are typically subject. Comparisons between the our carry fund appreciation and the MSCI All Country World Index are included for informational purposes only. \nConsolidation of Certain Carlyle Funds and Variable Interest Entities\nPursuant to U.S. GAAP, we consolidate certain Carlyle sponsored funds, related co-investment entities and CLOs that we advise, which we refer to collectively as the Consolidated Funds, in our consolidated financial statements. These funds represent approximately 13.7% of our AUM as of December 31, 2015, approximately 12% of our fund management fees and approximately 4% of our performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe are not required under U.S. GAAP to consolidate in our financial statements most of the investment funds we advise because such funds provide their limited partners with the right to dissolve the fund without cause by a simple majority vote of the non-Carlyle affiliated limited partners, which overcomes the presumption of control by Carlyle. However, we consolidate certain CLOs that we advise as a result of the application of the accounting standards governing consolidations. As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated CLOs held approximately $19 billion of total assets and comprised 71% of the assets of the Consolidated Funds and substantially all of the loans payable of the Consolidated Funds. As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles had approximately $4 billion of total assets and comprised 16% of the assets of the Consolidated Funds. The remainder of the assets of the Consolidated Funds as of December 31, 2015 primarily relate to our consolidated hedge funds and other consolidated funds. The assets and liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are generally held within separate legal entities and, as a result, the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are non-recourse to us.\nGenerally, the consolidation of the Consolidated Funds has a gross-up effect on our assets, liabilities and cash flows but has no net effect on the net income attributable to the Partnership and partners' capital. The majority of the net economic ownership interests of the Consolidated Funds are reflected as non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, and partners' capital appropriated for Consolidated Funds in the consolidated financial statements. For further information, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBecause only a small portion of our funds are consolidated, the performance of the Consolidated Funds is not necessarily consistent with or representative of the combined performance trends of all of our funds.\nIn addition, as described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of September 30, 2013, we began consolidating Urbplan, a Brazilian real estate portfolio company of certain of our real estate investment funds. Due to the timing and availability of financial information of Urbplan, we consolidate the financial position and results of operations of Urbplan on a financial reporting lag of 90 days. As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated financial statements included approximately $191 million of assets related to Urbplan.\nOn February 18, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-2, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. ASU 2015-2 provides a revised consolidation model for all reporting entities to use in evaluating whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities will be subject to reevaluation under this revised consolidation model. The revised consolidation model, among other things, (i) modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and (iii) modifies the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs through fee arrangements and related party relationships. This guidance in ASU 2015-2 is effective for us beginning on January 1, 2016. As a result, the Partnership will reduce the number of funds consolidated by the Partnership on January 1, 2016. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table and discussion sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on substantially the same basis for all historical periods presented; however, the consolidated funds are not the same entities in all periods shown due to changes in U.S. GAAP, changes in fund terms and the creation and termination of funds. We formed six CLOs in 2013, eight CLOs in 2014, and eight CLOs in 2015 and consolidated those CLOs beginning on their respective formation dates or closing dates. As further described below, the consolidation of these funds had the impact of increasing interest and other income of Consolidated Funds, interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds, and net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds in the year that the fund is initially consolidated. The consolidation of these funds had no effect on net income attributable to the Partnership for the periods presented. In addition, as described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of September 30, 2013, we began consolidating Urbplan, a Brazilian real estate portfolio company of certain of our real estate investment funds.\nTable 307: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

These fees eliminate upon consolidation of these funds.\nFund management fees include transaction and portfolio advisory fees, net of rebate offsets, of $25.2 million, $73.3 million, and $50.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The decrease in transaction and portfolio advisory fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and the increase in transaction and portfolio advisory fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily due to greater investment activity, mainly in our buyout funds, in 2014 as compared to 2015 and 2013, respectively.\nPerformance Fees.

During 2015, the global economy weakened. We believe this weakness is attributable to three primary and interrelated factors: the economic climate in China, crude oil prices and the availability of credit. In China, there has been a significant reduction in the capital spending of businesses operating in the energy, metals, and mining industries due to low commodity prices, which generally do not support new capital investment in businesses in these industries. The industrial sector of the U.S. has also seen a significant reduction in energy-related capital spending. The industrial production index declined 1.8% in 2015, the first 12-month decline in U.S. industrial output since 2009. This downturn in the industrial sector has created a tightening of credit availability for transactions, resulting in market volatility. This volatility can impact our public portfolio valuations. Amongst these market conditions, our carry fund portfolio appreciated 7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to carry fund portfolio appreciation of 15% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Furthermore, approximately $219 million in performance fees from our Legacy Energy funds and CEMOF funds were reversed during 2015.\nThe decrease in performance fees recorded in 2014 as compared to 2013 were due principally to lesser appreciation in our carry funds in 2014 as compared to 2013, as well as the lack of any significant hedge fund incentive fees during 2014 and because two corporate private equity funds, CEP III and CAP III, exceeded their performance thresholds in 2013, resulting in a cumulative catch-up of performance fees in 2013 versus performance fee accruals in 2014 at a normalized rate. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the hedge funds generated incentive fees of $145.7 million, whereas hedge fund incentive fees for 2014 were not significant. During 2014, the general economic climate started the year weaker, but by the second half of the year, the U.S. macroeconomic outlook improved with gross domestic product growth averaging nearly 4% at an annualized rate. This acceleration in growth helped to offset the 2.1% contraction in the first quarter of 2014 and bring GDP growth for the year to roughly 2.5%. Stock markets outside of the U.S. were generally weaker in 2014, with the EuroStoxx index up to 3%, the MSCI ex-U.S. index down by 5.7% and the MSCI Emerging index down by 3.5%.\nIn addition, performance fees from consolidated funds decreased $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and performance fees from consolidated funds decreased $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. These fees eliminate upon consolidation.\nInvestment Income (Loss). Investment income increased $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and decreased $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to the following:\nTable 311: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Decrease (increase) in investment losses from the investment in\nNGP, primarily due to carried interest reversals in NGP X\nbeing higher in 2014 than 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (Absence of) investment gain associated with the sale of a\nEuropean real estate investment in 2014\n</td> <td>(22.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>22.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Increase (decrease) in investment income from a European real\nestate investment\n</td> <td>41.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> All other changes\n</td> <td>(15.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total increase (decrease) in investment income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest and Other Income of Consolidated Funds. Our CLOs generate interest income primarily from investments in bonds and loans inclusive of amortization of discounts and generate other income from consent and amendment fees. Also included in this balance is interest income and dividend income recognized by the consolidated fund of funds vehicles and consolidated hedge funds. Substantially all interest and other income of the CLOs and other consolidated funds together with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment gains of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the related funds' limited partners or CLO investors and therefore is allocated to non-controlling interests. Accordingly, such amounts have no material impact on net income attributable to the Partnership.\nInterest and other income of consolidated funds increased $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and decreased $87.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013.

Revenue of a consolidated real estate VIE was $86.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $70.2 million in 2014 and $7.5 million in 2013. During 2014 and throughout 2015, Urbplan completed several land development projects and, therefore, the increase in revenue of a consolidated real estate VIE in 2015 and 2014 primarily represents an increase in completed land development projects in 2015 relative to 2014 and 2014 relative to 2013. Urbplan recognizes revenue for land development services under the completed contract method. For the year ended December 31, 2013, however, substantially all of Urbplan's revenue was derived from investment income.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses decreased $307.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and increased $81.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013.

As a result of the restructuring, the Partnership's economic interest in Carlyle Commodity Management increased from 55% to approximately 83% effective July 1, 2015; no consideration was paid by the Partnership for the increase in economic interest. As a result of the restructuring, the estimated value of the employment-based contingent consideration liability related to Carlyle Commodity Management decreased by $46.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nEquity-based compensation. Equity-based compensation increased $34.0 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase in equity-based compensation from 2014 to 2015 is due to the ongoing granting of deferred restricted common units to new and existing employees during 2014 and 2015. Also contributing to the increase in equity-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 was a decrease to the estimated forfeiture rates in the first quarter of 2015.\nEquity-based compensation increased $21.6 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase in equity-based compensation from 2013 to 2014 is due to the ongoing granting of deferred restricted common units to new and existing employees during 2013 and 2014. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in expense of $30.8 million recognized on vesting for the difference between the estimated forfeitures and actual forfeitures on Carlyle Holdings partnership units that vested during these periods.\nPerformance fee related compensation expense. Performance fee related compensation expense decreased $362.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and decreased $310.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. Performance fee related compensation expense as a percentage of performance fees was 62%, 52%, and 50% in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For our largest segment, Corporate Private Equity, our performance fee related compensation expense is generally 45%. The overall percentage of 62% for the year ended December 31, 2015 is higher than 52% for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to performance fees earned during the year by our private equity fund of funds vehicles in our Investment Solutions segment (which pay a higher ratio of performance fees as compensation) and our Legacy Energy funds within our Real Assets segment (which had carry reversals during the year without the corresponding reversal of performance fee compensation expense).\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General, administrative and other expenses increased $186.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and increased $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to:\nTable 316: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher intangible asset amortization and impairment\nexpenses *\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher expenses for litigation and contingencies\n(See Note 11)\n</td> <td>60.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher (lower) external fundraising costs\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange adjustments and other changes\n</td> <td>(31.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total increase in general, administrative and other expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, we evaluate our intangible assets (including goodwill) for impairment and could record additional impairment losses in future periods. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded an impairment loss of $15.0 million to reduce the carrying value of the intangible assets related to the fund of hedge funds within the Investment Solutions segment to their estimated fair value. During the third week of February 2016, we decided to restructure our Investment Solutions segment to focus on private market secondaries, co-investment and managed account activities and, given the challenging market environment, discontinue our fund of hedge funds and liquid alternative initiatives. On February 19, 2016, we commenced a wind down of the operations of Diversified Global Asset Management Corporation ( DGAM\u201d) and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $7.0 million in our results for the year ended December 31, 2015 that had not been previously reflected in our earnings presentation issued on February 10, 2016. In addition, we estimate we will incur between $10.0 million and $15.0 million in employee separation and other contract termination costs associated with the wind down of DGAM in 2016.\nInterest. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $58.0 million, an increase of $2.3 million from 2014. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $55.7 million, an increase of $10.2 million from 2013. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 was due primarily to the interest on $400 million and $200 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2043 issued in March 2013 and March 2014, respectively. The increase in interest expense from 2013 to 2014 was partially offset by $1.9 million of expense recorded in 2013 related to deferred financing costs expensed upon the early extinguishment of debt.\nInterest and Other Expenses of Consolidated Funds. Interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds decreased $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and increased $151.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily\ndue to lower interest expense on the consolidated hedge funds and lower other expenses on the consolidated fund of funds vehicles, substantially offset by higher interest expense on the consolidated CLOs. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 relates primarily to the additional interest expense incurred related to the six CLOs formed throughout 2013 and the eight CLOs formed in 2014.\nThe CLOs incur interest expense on their loans payable and incur other expenses consisting of trustee fees, rating agency fees and professional fees. Substantially all interest and other income of our CLOs and other consolidated funds together with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the related funds' limited partners or CLO investors and therefore is allocated to non-controlling interests. Accordingly, such amounts have no material impact on net income attributable to the Partnership.\nInterest and Other Expenses of a Consolidated Real Estate VIE. Interest and other expenses of a consolidated real estate VIE decreased $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and increased $141.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to:\nTable 317: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher expenses associated with land development services as a\nresult of the completion of the related land development\nprojects\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Lower) higher expenses related to fair market value adjustment\nfor Urbplan loans *\n</td> <td>(37.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>34.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Higher interest expense\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Lower) higher compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Lower) higher general, administrative and other expenses\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>32.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (decrease) increase in interest and other expenses of a\nConsolidated Real Estate VIE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* The Partnership records the Urbplan loans at fair value at each reporting period and records the change in fair value to interest and other expenses of a consolidated real estate VIE.\nAdditionally, the increase in interest and other expenses of a consolidated real estate VIE for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 includes Urbplan expenses for 2013 only for the period from September 30, 2013 (the date that the Partnership began consolidating Urbplan) through December 31, 2013, as compared to a full year of operating expenses for 2014.\nOther Non-operating (Income) Expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, this caption primarily represents the change in the fair value of contingent consideration associated with the Partnership's acquisitions. The contingent consideration arrangements are primarily associated with the Partnership's hedge fund acquisitions.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the overall estimated fair value of the contingent consideration associated with the Partnership's hedge fund acquisitions decreased based on management's assumptions in the probability-weighted discounted cash flow models used to estimate the fair value of these contingent considerations at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nGenerally, the contingent consideration associated with the Partnership's acquisitions is payable at future dates over a period of years. Because the estimated fair value of these obligations relies upon estimates of cash flows in those future periods, there will be inherent volatility in the fair value of the Partnership's liability (and as a result, the periodic expense recognized) until such time as the future cash flow projections become more definitive. However, if the financial performance of the acquisitions is consistent with, or exceeds, the Partnership's original financial forecast at acquisition, the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities will increase over time (with a corresponding expense) as the actual performance measurement date for the payment approaches.\nNet Investment Gains of Consolidated Funds.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 net investment gains of Consolidated Funds was $864.4 million, $887.0 million, and $696.7 million, respectively. This balance is driven predominantly by our consolidated AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles, CLOs, and hedge funds. For the consolidated CLOs, the amount includes the net gain or loss on the fair value adjustment of both the assets and liabilities. The components of net investment gains of consolidated funds for the respective periods are comprised of the following:\nTable 318: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized gains\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,114.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,107.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>662.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in unrealized gains (losses)\n</td> <td>(688.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(249.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>728.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gains\n</td> <td>426.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>857.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,390.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains (losses) on liabilities of CLOs\n</td> <td>436.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(695.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gains on other assets of CLOs\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment gains of Consolidated Funds\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>864.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>887.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>696.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe unrealized investment gains/losses include the appreciation/depreciation of the equity investments within the consolidated AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles, the appreciation/depreciation of CLO investments in loans and bonds, as well as the appreciation/depreciation of investments made by our consolidated hedge funds and other consolidated funds.

NGP X performance fees, which are included in investment income in the U.S. GAAP financial statements. Adjustments to investment income (loss) also include the reclassification of earnings for the investment in NGP Management to the appropriate operating captions for the Non-GAAP results, the exclusion of charges associated with the investment in NGP Management that are excluded from the Non-GAAP results and adjustments to reflect the Partnership's share of Urbplan's net losses as investment losses for the Non-GAAP results. Adjustments to performance fee related compensation expense relate to the inclusion of certain tax expenses associated with performance fee related compensation. Adjustments are also included in these financial statement captions to reflect Carlyle's 55% economic interest in each of Claren Road, ESG and, for periods prior to July 1, 2015, Carlyle Commodity Management.

Our segment information is reflected in the manner used by our senior management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. Included in our 2015 general, administrative and other expenses for both our U.S. GAAP financial results and ENI is a $50 million reserve for ongoing litigation and contingencies that is excluded from Fee Related Earnings and Distributable Earnings, as the timing of any payment remains uncertain. This reserve has been allocated to our business segments in accordance with our allocation policies for overhead.\nFor segment reporting purposes, revenues and expenses are presented on a basis that deconsolidates our Consolidated Funds. As a result, segment revenues from management fees, performance fees and investment income are different than those presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis because fund management fees recognized in certain segments are received from Consolidated Funds and are eliminated in consolidation when presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis. Furthermore, segment expenses are different than related amounts presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis due to the exclusion of fund expenses that are paid by the Consolidated Funds. Segment revenue and expenses are also different than those presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis because we present our segment revenues and expenses related to Claren Road, ESG, and, for periods prior to July 1, 2015, Carlyle Commodity Management based on our 55% economic interest in those entities. Effective July 1, 2015, our segment revenue and expenses related to Carlyle Commodity Management are based on our approximate 83% economic interest in that entity. For periods prior to August 1, 2013 (the date we acquired the remaining 40% equity interest in AlpInvest), we present our segment revenues and expenses based on our historical ownership interest in AlpInvest of 60%. Also, ENI excludes expenses associated with equity-based compensation that was issued in our initial public offering or is issued in acquisitions and strategic investments.\nCorporate Private

The increase in catch-up management fees was driven primarily by subsequent closings in 2015 from our fourth Europe buyout fund ( CEP IV\u201d), CJP III, and our third Europe technology fund ( CETP III\u201d), as compared to subsequent closings in 2014 from our fourth Asia buyout fund ( CAP IV\u201d) and our second global financial services fund ( CGFSP II\u201d).\nThe increase in management fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily due to CP VI and CAP IV commencing management fees in 2013 and CEP IV commencing management fees in 2014.\nThe weighted average management fee rate increased from 1.22% at December 31, 2014 to 1.26% at December 31, 2015. The increase in the weighted average management fee rate reflects new funds being raised with higher management fee rates, namely CEP IV, CAP IV, and CEOF II. Fee-earning AUM was $40.9 billion and $40.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, reflecting an increase of $0.7 billion.\nThe weighted average management fee rate increased from 1.15% at December 31, 2013 to 1.22% at December 31, 2014. The increase in the weighted average management fee rate reflects new commitments to funds with higher management fee rates, namely CAP IV and CEP IV. Fee-earning AUM was $40.2 billion and $43.0 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $2.8 billion.\nThe decrease in transaction fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and the increase in transaction fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily due to higher investment activity, primarily in our buyout funds, in 2014 as compared to 2015 and 2013, respectively.\nDirect and indirect compensation expense. Direct and indirect compensation expense decreased $8.5 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and lower bonuses in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in headcount as well as increased compensation costs related to fundraising activities of approximately $2.3 million, primarily related to fundraising for our second U.S. mid-market buyout fund ( CEOF II\u201d) and CEP IV.\nDirect and indirect base compensation expense increased $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or 5%, as compared to 2013. The increase is primarily due to incremental compensation related to increased headcount, promotions, and bonuses, primarily for our buyout funds. This increase was partially offset by lower compensation associated with fundraising efforts in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower negative foreign currency adjustments and lower professional fees.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease is primarily due to lower external costs associated with fundraising activities in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nEconomic Net Income\nEconomic net income decreased $462.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and decreased $192.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013.

The recognition of realized performance fees results in a reversal of accumulated unrealized performance fees, generally resulting in minimal impact on total performance fees. Additionally, because unrealized performance fees can be reversed upon a realization event, in periods where the Partnership generates significant realized performance fees unrealized performance fees can be negative even in periods of portfolio appreciation.\nTotal Investment Income. Total investment income (realized and unrealized) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $18.1 million compared to investment income of $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in investment income from 2014 to 2015 relates primarily to lower appreciation on investments in certain buyout funds.\nInvestment income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $31.6 million compared to investment income of $26.2 million in 2013. The increase in investment income from 2013 to 2014 relates primarily to higher gains on investments in certain Europe buyout funds.\nEquity-based Compensation. Equity-based compensation was $65.1 million, $42.5 million, and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The increase from 2014 to 2015 and the increase from 2013 to 2014 are due to the ongoing granting of deferred restricted common units to new and existing employees during 2013, 2014 and 2015, and a decrease in the estimated forfeiture rates during 2013 and 2015.\nReserve for Litigation and Contingencies. Corporate Private Equity's share of a reserve for litigation and contingencies was $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Fee-earning AUM was $40.9 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $0.7 billion, or 2%, compared to $40.2 billion at December 31, 2014. Inflows of $6.4 billion were primarily related to limited partner commitments raised by CEP IV, CJP III, and the activation of commitments in CEOF II. This was offset by outflows of $4.9 billion which were principally a result of distributions from several buyout funds that were outside of their investment period, in addition to the reduction in management fee basis from commitments to invested equity for funds at the end of their original investment period and $0.6 billion in foreign exchange loss. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 15% of the total external commitments raised for our global buyout fund ( CGP\u201d) in current and prior periods are reflected in fee-earning AUM, as this fund is based on invested equity. Investment and distribution activity by funds still in the investment period does not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments.\nFee-earning AUM was $40.2 billion at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $2.8 billion, or 6%, compared to $43.0 billion at December 31, 2013. Outflows of $6.5 billion were principally a result of distributions from several buyout funds that were outside of their investment period, in addition to the reduction in management fee basis for funds at the end of their original investment period and $1.3 billion in foreign exchange loss. This was offset by inflows of $4.8 billion, primarily related to limited partner commitments raised by CAP IV, CEP IV, CGFSP II, and CETP III.\nFee-earning AUM was $43.0 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $9.2 billion, or approximately 27%, compared to $33.8 billion at December 31, 2012. Inflows of $17.2 billion were primarily related to limited partner commitments raised by CP VI, CAP IV, and CGFSP II, as well as equity invested by various funds outside of their investment period. Outflows of $7.5 billion were partially driven by (a) a $3.9 billion decrease resulting from the change in basis from commitments to invested capital for CP V, CAP III, and our first global financial services fund ( CGFSP I\u201d), and (b) $3.6 billion of distributions from several funds that were outside of their investment period.\nTotal AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2015.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforwards of Available Capital and Fair Value of Capital, and the resulting rollforward of Total AUM.\nTable 345: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Available Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value of\nCapital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total AUM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Private Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, As of December 31, 2012\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments (1)\n</td> <td>11,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Called, net (2)\n</td> <td>(5,313\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(315\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions (3)\n</td> <td>946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,974\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,028\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) (4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange and other (5)\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, As of December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments (1)\n</td> <td>6,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Called, net (2)\n</td> <td>(7,380\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(562\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions (3)\n</td> <td>997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,742\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,745\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) (4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange and other (5)\n</td> <td>(584\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,299\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,883\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, As of December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments (1)\n</td> <td>7,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Called, net (2)\n</td> <td>(8,355\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(610\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions (3)\n</td> <td>693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,505\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,812\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) (4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange and other (5)\n</td> <td>(482\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(896\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,378\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents capital raised by our carry funds, net of expired available capital. \n (2) Represents capital called by our carry funds, net of fund fees and expenses.

Total AUM was $63.1 billion at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $1.6 billion, or 2%, compared to $64.7 billion at December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by $13.5 billion in distributions, of which $0.7 billion is recallable, and $1.4 billion of foreign exchange loss. Offsetting this were increases of $7.9 billion from new commitments driven by fundraising in CEP IV, CEOF II, CGP, CJP III and other funds and coinvestment vehicles and $5.4 billion of market appreciation, representing a 13% increase in our portfolio of carry funds for the period. Our public portfolio appreciated 22% ($3.0 billion), our private portfolio appreciated 6% ($1.3 billion), and the remainder of our appreciation was in our coinvestment vehicles. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $1.3 billion attributable to CEP III (25% appreciation), $1.0 billion attributable to CAP III (45% appreciation), and $0.4 billion attributable to CP V (3% appreciation).\nTotal AUM was $64.7 billion at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $0.2 billion, or 0.30%, compared to $64.9 billion at December 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily driven by (a) distributions of $14.7 billion, of which $1.0 billion is recallable, and (b) foreign exchange loss of $1.9 billion. Offsetting this decrease were (a) commitments of $6.7 billion in CAP IV, CEP IV, CETP III, CGFSP II and other funds and coinvestment vehicles, and (b) a total 2014 appreciation in remaining fair value of assets of 23%, leading to market appreciation in the segment of $9.3 billion. Our public portfolio appreciated 36% ($5.6 billion), our private portfolio appreciated 12% ($2.2 billion), and the remainder of our appreciation was in our\ncoinvestment vehicles. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $3.2 billion attributable to CP V (24% appreciation), $2.8 billion attributable to CEP III (46% appreciation), and $0.4 billion attributable to CP IV (9% appreciation).\nTotal AUM was $64.9 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $11.6 billion, or approximately 22%, compared to $53.3 billion at December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily driven by (a) $11.5 billion of new commitments for several funds, including CP VI, CAP IV, CGFSP II, CSSAF I, CJP III, our Ireland fund ( CCI\u201d) and various co-investments, and (b) market appreciation across our portfolio of $10.3 billion. The total 2013 appreciation in the remaining value of assets for funds in this segment was approximately 30%, driven by a 30% increase in the buyout funds and a 32% increase in the growth funds. Our public portfolio appreciated 48% ($6.4 billion), our private portfolio appreciated 17% ($3.1 billion), and the remainder of our appreciation was in our coinvestment vehicles. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $3.2 billion attributable to CP V (30% appreciation), $2.1 billion attributable to CP IV (33% appreciation), and $1.8 billion attributable to CEP III (33% appreciation).\nFund Performance Metrics\nFund performance information for our investment funds that generally have at least $1.0 billion in capital commitments, cumulative equity invested or total value as of December 31, 2015, which we refer to as our significant funds,\u201d is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented. The fund return information reflected in this discussion and analysis is not indicative of the performance of The Carlyle Group L.P. and is also not necessarily indicative of the future performance of any particular fund. An investment in The Carlyle Group L.P. is not an investment in any of our funds. There can be no assurance that any of our funds or our other existing and future funds will achieve similar returns. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business Operations - The historical returns attributable to our funds, including those presented in this report, should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on an investment in our common units.\u201d\nThe following tables reflect the performance of our significant funds in our Corporate Private Equity business.

date\u201d performance results of our segments relates to the period following the formation of the first fund within each segment. For our Corporate Private Equity segment our first fund was formed in 1990. \n (2) Represents the original cost of all capital called for investments since inception of the fund. \n (3) Represents all realized proceeds combined with remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest. \n (4) Multiple of invested capital ( MOIC\u201d) represents total fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, divided by cumulative invested capital. \n (5) An investment is considered realized when the investment fund has completely exited, and ceases to own an interest in, the investment. An investment is considered partially realized when the total amount of proceeds received in respect of such investment, including dividends, interest or other distributions and/or return of capital, represents at least 85% of invested capital and such investment is not yet fully realized. Because part of our value creation strategy involves pursuing best exit alternatives, we believe information regarding Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR, when considered together with the other investment performance metrics presented, provides investors with meaningful information regarding our investment performance by removing the impact of investments where significant realization \nactivity has not yet occurred. Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR have limitations as measures of investment performance, and should not be considered in isolation. Such limitations include the fact that these measures do not include the performance of earlier stage and other investments that do not satisfy the criteria provided above. The exclusion of such investments will have a positive impact on Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR in instances when the MOIC and Gross IRR in respect of such investments are less than the aggregate MOIC and Gross IRR. Our measurements of Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR may not be comparable to those of other companies that use similarly titled measures. We do not present Realized/Partially Realized performance information separately for funds that are still in the investment period because of the relatively insignificant level of realizations for funds of this type. However, to the extent such funds have had realizations, they are included in the Realized/Partially Realized performance information presented for Total Corporate Private Equity.\n (6) Fully Invested funds are past the expiration date of the investment period as defined in the respective limited partnership agreement. In instances where a successor fund has had its first capital call, the predecessor fund is categorized as fully invested. \n (7) Gross Internal Rate of Return ( Gross IRR\u201d) represents the annualized IRR for the period indicated on Limited Partner invested capital based on contributions, distributions and unrealized value before management fees, expenses and carried interest. \n (8) Net Internal Rate of Return ( Net IRR\u201d) represents the annualized IRR for the period indicated on Limited Partner invested capital based on contributions, distributions and unrealized value after management fees, expenses and carried interest. \n (9) Aggregate includes the following funds: CP I, CMG, CVP I, CVP II, CUSGF III, CEVP, CETP I, CAVP I, CAVP II, CAGP III, Mexico, and MENA. \n (10) Includes coinvestments and certain other stand-alone investments arranged by us. \n (11) Aggregate includes the following funds: CGP, CSABF, CSSAF, CPF I, CCI, and CETP III. \n (12) Returns are not considered meaningful, as the investment period commenced in May 2012 for CP VI, November 2012 for CAP IV, April 2013 for CGFSP II, August 2013 for CEP IV, August 2014 for CJP III, and March 2015 for CEOF II. \n (13) For purposes of aggregation, funds that report in foreign currency have been converted to U.S. dollars at the reporting period spot rate. \nTable 365: <table><tr><td> </td>

The decrease in realized investment income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower realizations on our distressed debt funds. The decrease in realized investment income for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower realizations in our investments in one of our business development companies.\nFee Related Earnings\nFee related earnings decreased $52.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and decreased $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013.

Offsetting these decreases were increases in management fees from the Claren Road and ESG hedge funds from greater assets under management of $16.3 million.\nThe weighted average management fee rate on our hedge funds decreased from 1.73% at December 31, 2014 to 1.59% at December 31, 2015 due to reduced AUM from net redemptions in our Claren Road funds, which charge a higher rate. The weighted average management fee rate on our carry funds decreased from 1.48% at December 31, 2014 to 1.38% at December 31, 2015 due to the reduction in both the fee basis and rate of CSP III and CEMOF I as they switched from commitments to invested equity at the end of their respective original investment periods.\nThe weighted average management fee rate on our hedge funds decreased from 1.77% at December 31, 2013 to 1.73% at December 31, 2014 due to higher AUM in the ESG hedge funds, which charge a lower rate, and decreases in AUM in the Carlyle Commodity Management hedge funds. The weighted average management fee rate on our carry funds decreased from 1.53% at December 31, 2013 to 1.48% at December 31, 2014 due to a step down in fee basis from commitments to invested capital on our second corporate mezzanine fund ( CMP II\u201d).\nDirect and indirect compensation expense. Direct and indirect compensation expense decreased $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower headcount and bonuses in 2015, partially offset by incremental compensation costs of $4.5 million related to fundraising activities, primarily associated with our second energy mezzanine fund ( CEMOF II\u201d).\nDirect and indirect base compensation increased $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, which primarily relates to incremental compensation costs related to increased headcount, promotions, and bonuses.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses increased $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to higher external costs associated with fundraising activities of $10.4 million, mostly related to our second energy mezzanine fund, partially offset by lower negative foreign currency adjustments.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease is primarily due to higher external costs associated with fundraising activities for the business development companies and for carry funds during 2013 as compared to 2014.\nEconomic Net Income (Loss)\nEconomic net income (loss) decreased $155.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and decreased $112.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013.

Net performance fees decreased $68.8 million to $59.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $128.5 million in 2013.\nTotal Investment Income (Loss). Total investment loss (realized and unrealized) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $10.3 million compared to investment income of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in investment income from 2014 to 2015 relates primarily to depreciation on U.S.-denominated collateralized loan obligations as well as investment losses in 2015 in CEMOF as compared to investment income in 2014.\nTotal investment income was $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to investment income of $16.0 million in 2013. The decrease in investment income was due primarily to a realization of a debt investment in 2013 that resulted in a net investment gain of approximately $4.7 million. Also contributing to the decrease was lower appreciation on our CLO investments in 2014 as compared to 2013, which resulted in a decrease in investment income of $4.2 million from 2013 to 2014.\nEquity-based Compensation. Equity-based compensation was $19.0 million, $13.9 million, and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The increase from 2014 to 2015 and the increase from 2013 to 2014 are due to the ongoing granting of deferred restricted common units to new and existing employees during 2013, 2014 and 2015, and a decrease in the estimated forfeiture rates during 2013 and 2015.\nReserve for Litigation and Contingencies.

This was driven by $4.3 billion of net redemptions in our hedge funds, $1.0 billion of net outflows including distributions, primarily due to the change in basis from commitments to invested equity in CSP III and our first energy mezzanine fund ( CEMOF I\u201d), and $0.7 billion in market depreciation. This was partially offset by $2.4 billion of inflows, including commitments, primarily driven by new commitments in CEMOF II and a $0.9 billion increase in the collateral balances of our CLO's. Distributions from carry funds still in the investment period do not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments and not invested capital.\nFee-earning AUM was $33.9 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $0.5 billion, or 1%, compared to $33.4 billion at December 31, 2013. This was driven by a $1.9 billion increase in the aggregate par value of our CLO collateral balances as a result of the eight new CLOs issued during the year and $0.8 billion of subscriptions, net of redemptions in our hedge funds. These increases are offset by $1.5 billion in market depreciation, primarily in our hedge funds and $0.5 billion in distributions from our fully invested carry funds.\nFee-earning AUM was $33.4 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $2.4 billion, or 8%, compared to $31.0 billion at December 31, 2012. This increase was driven by $1.0 billion of subscriptions, net of redemptions, market appreciation of $0.8 billion in our hedge funds and $0.6 billion of new commitments raised by our carry funds.

companies, net of fund fees and expenses. Equity invested amounts may vary from capital called due to timing differences between acquisition and capital call dates. \n (3) Represents distributions from our carry funds and business development companies, net of amounts recycled. Distributions are based on when proceeds are actually distributed to investors, which may differ from when they are realized. \n (4) Represents the net result of subscriptions to and redemptions from our hedge funds and mutual fund. Our hedge fund partnerships had outstanding redemption requests for $3.1 billion in the aggregate as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. \n (5) Represents the change in the aggregate collateral balance and principal cash and principal notes at par of the CLOs/structured products. \n (6) Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments and changes in the net asset value of our hedge funds. \n (7) Represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds and other changes in AUM. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end. \n (8) Ending balance is comprised of approximately $19.4 billion from our structured credit /other structured product funds, $8.3 billion in our hedge funds, $6.2 billion (including $3.8 billion of Available Capital) in our carry funds, and $1.4 billion from our business development companies.  Total AUM was $35.3 billion at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $1.4 billion, or 4%, compared to $36.7 billion at December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by $4.4 billion in net redemptions from our hedge funds, $0.9 billion of market depreciation, representing a 8% ($0.2 billion) decrease on our portfolio of carry funds for the period and declines in our hedge funds, and $0.4 billion of foreign exchange decreases in our Euro-denominated CLOs. Offsetting these decreases were $2.7 billion of new commitments driven by fundraising in CEMOF II and $1.6 billion increases in the par value of our CLO collateral balances.\nTotal AUM was $36.7 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 4%, compared to $35.5 billion at December 31, 2013. This increase was driven by (a) changes in the aggregate par value of our CLO collateral balances of $2.1 billion, primarily due to eight new issue CLOs raised, and (b) commitments of approximately $0.2 billion related to our carry funds and their related coinvestments. These increases were partially offset by market depreciation of $1.2 billion, representing declines in our hedge funds partially offset by a 20% ($0.4 billion) increase on our portfolio of carry funds for the period, and distributions in our carry funds of $0.9 billion, of which $0.5 billion was recycled back into available capital. Increases due to subscriptions, net of redemptions, to our hedge funds of $0.9 billion in 2014 are exclusive of approximately $2.2 billion of net redemption notifications effective January 1, 2015.\nTotal AUM was $35.5 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $3.0 billion, or approximately 9%, compared to $32.5 billion at December 31, 2012. This increase was driven by (a) market appreciation of $1.4 billion, representing increases in our hedge funds coupled with a 28% ($0.5 billion) increase on our portfolio of carry funds for the period, (b) subscriptions, net of redemptions, to our hedge funds of $1.0 billion, (c) new commitments to our CSP III carry fund of approximately $0.3 billion, and (d) six new issue CLOs raised totaling $3.1 billion, offset by the liquidation of certain existing CLOs in accordance with their business plans. These increases were partially offset by distributions in our carry funds of $1.1 billion, of which $0.3 billion was recycled back into available capital.\nFund Performance Metrics\nFund performance information for certain of our Global Market Strategies Funds is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

The increase in realized investment loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily represented the realization of Carlyle's cumulative losses from our guarantee of liabilities of Carlyle Europe Real Estate Partners I. L.P. ( CEREP I\u201d) associated with an adverse court judgment in a French tax court proceeding of $80 million, offset by $9.7 million of lower realized investment losses in 2015 associated with Urbplan.\nThe increase in realized investment loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to realized investment losses on Urbplan and a mezzanine loan investment to one of our European real estate funds, partially offset by an investment gain from the sale of a European real estate investment.\nFee Related Earnings\nFee related earnings increased $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and declined $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013.

The increase in catch-up management fees is primarily due from subsequent closings on our seventh U.S. real estate fund ( CRP VII\u201d), our first international energy fund ( CIEP I\u201d) and our second power fund ( CPP II\u201d). Also, the increase in fund management fees was due to the commencement of the investment period of CRP VII and CPP II in June 2014 when both funds began to charge management fees at such time, as well as higher assets under management from additional commitments raised during 2014 and 2015 in CRP VII, CIEP I, and CPP II. These increases were partially offset by declines in fund management fees from distributions from certain other U.S. and European real estate funds outside of their investment periods, which had the effect of lowering the management fee base of those funds.\nThe increase in management fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily due $40.9 million of incremental management fees earned in 2014 from CIEP I, which commenced its investment period in September 2013, including catch-up management fees earned in 2014 from subsequent closings of that fund of approximately $14.4 million. Also contributing to the increase was $16.1 million of incremental management fees from the commencement of management fees on CRP VII in 2014, which includes $3.3 million of catch-up management fees from subsequent closings of that fund. This increase was partially offset by declines in management fees from distributions from certain other U.S. and European real estate funds and NGP management fee funds outside of their investment periods.\nThe total weighted average management fee rate declined to 1.24% at December 31, 2015 from 1.31% at December 31, 2014 primarily due to new commitments to CRP VII and CPP II which charges a lower management fee rate compared to other funds. The weighted average management fee rate for funds in the investment period declined to 1.44% at December 31, 2015 from 1.54% at December 31, 2014 primarily due to fundraising in CRP VII and CPP II.\nThe total weighted average management fee rate increased to 1.31% at December 31, 2014 from 1.18% at December 31, 2013, primarily due to commitments to CRP VII and CIEP I. Despite the step down from commitments to invested capital in one of our Legacy Energy funds ( Renew II\u201d), from which we are entitled a 10% allocation of management fee related revenues, the weighted average management fee rate for funds in the investment period increased from 1.27% at December 31, 2013 to 1.54% at December 31, 2014 due to fundraising in CIEP I and CRP VII, from which we are entitled to 100% of management fee related revenues.\nDirect and indirect compensation expense. Direct and indirect compensation expense declined $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower bonuses in 2015 as well as lower compensation associated with fundraising of $7.1 million in 2015 versus 2014, driven by fundraising activities in 2014 related to CRP VII and CIEP I.\nDirect and indirect base compensation increased $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase in compensation was due primarily to increased compensation associated with fundraising efforts for CRP VII and NGP carry funds, as well as incremental compensation costs related to increased headcount, promotions, and bonuses.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to a decrease of $7.1 million in external costs associated with fundraising activities.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses increased $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase primarily relates to an increase in external costs associated with fundraising activities for CRP VII and CIEP I, as well as an increase in professional fees associated with CIEP I.\nEconomic Net Income (Loss)\nEconomic net income increased $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and economic net loss increased $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013.

Total investment loss (realized and unrealized) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $30.5 million compared to total investment loss of $47.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The 2015 investment loss of $30.5 million was due primarily to $34 million in losses from our guarantee of liabilities of CEREP I associated with an adverse court judgment in a French tax court proceeding related to a transaction that CEREP I exited\nbetween 2007 and 2009. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The 2014 investment loss of $47.9 million was due primarily to unrealized losses associated with the guarantee of liabilities of CEREP I associated with the French tax court matter of $11.2 million, investment losses on certain other European real estate investments of $30.8 million, and losses associated with Urbplan of $24.3 million, partially offset by an investment gain of $22.5 million from the sale of another European real estate investment.\nTotal investment loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $47.9 million compared to an investment loss of $85.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decline in investment loss from 2013 to 2014 was due primarily to net investment losses on certain European real estate investments of $23.6 million in 2014 versus $76.6 million in 2013. This decline was offset by higher investment losses related to Urbplan, which were $24.3 million in 2014 versus $11.8 million in 2013.\nEquity-based Compensation. Equity-based compensation was $25.0 million, $19.2 million, and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The increase from 2014 to 2015 and the increase from 2013 to 2014 are due to the ongoing granting of deferred restricted common units to new and existing employees during 2013, 2014 and 2015, and a decrease in the estimated forfeiture rates during 2013 and 2015.\nReserve for Litigation and Contingencies. Real Assets' share of a reserve for litigation and contingencies was $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nFee-earning AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2015.\nFee-earning AUM is presented below for each period together with the components of change during each respective period.\nThe table below breaks out Fee-earning AUM by its respective components at each period.\nTable 442: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of Fee-earning AUM (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on capital commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on invested capital (2)\n</td> <td>17,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee-earning AUM based on lower of cost or fair value and other (3)\n</td> <td>964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>646\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Fee-earning AUM (4)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,905\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted Average Management Fee Rates (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Funds\n</td> <td>1.24\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds in Investment Period\n</td> <td>1.44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) For additional information concerning the components of Fee-earning AUM, See -Fee-earning Assets under Management.\u201d \n (2) Includes amounts committed to or reserved for investments for certain real estate funds. \n (3) Includes certain funds that are calculated on gross asset value. \n (4) Energy II, Energy III, Energy IV, Renew I, and Renew II (collectively, the Legacy Energy Funds\u201d), are managed with Riverstone Holdings LLC and its affiliates. Affiliates of both Carlyle and Riverstone act as investment advisers to each of the Legacy Energy Funds. With the exception of Energy IV and Renew II, where Carlyle has a minority representation on the funds' management committees, management of each of the Legacy Energy Funds is vested in committees with equal representation by Carlyle and Riverstone, and the consent of representatives of both Carlyle and Riverstone is required for investment decisions. As of December 31, 2015, the Legacy Energy Funds had, in the aggregate, approximately $6.3 billion in AUM and $5.8 billion in Fee-earning AUM. NGP VII, NGP VIII, NGP IX, or in the case of NGP M&R, NGP ETP I, and NGP ETP II, certain affiliated entities (collectively, the NGP management fee funds\u201d) and NGP X, NGP GAP and NGP XI (referred to herein as, \"carry funds\"), are managed by NGP Energy Capital Management.

Fee-earning AUM was $30.9 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $2.5 billion, or 9%, compared to $28.4 billion at December 31, 2014. This increase was driven by inflows of $8.4 billion primarily related to new commitments in CRP VII, CPP II, and CIEP I as well as the activation of previously raised commitments in NGP XI. This increase was partially offset by outflows of $5.7 billion, primarily related to distribution activity in our funds outside the original investment period in addition to the reduction in management fee basis for funds at the end of their original investment period. Investment and distribution activity by funds still in the original investment period do not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments and not invested capital. Changes in fair value have no impact on Fee-earning AUM for Real Assets as all of the funds generate management fees based on either commitments or invested capital at cost, neither of which is impacted by fair value movements.\nFee-earning AUM was relatively unchanged at $28.4 billion for the periods ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Outflows of $5.9 billion were principally due to distributions from our fully invested Legacy Energy funds, our U.S. and Europe real estate funds and foreign exchange loss of $0.3 billion. Inflows of $6.1 billion were primarily to commitments to CRP VII and CIEP I, in addition to investments made by our Legacy Energy funds, our U.S. real estate funds and NGP funds with fees based on invested equity.\nFee-earning AUM was $28.4 billion at December 31, 2013, a decrease of $0.9 billion, or 3%, compared to $29.3 billion at December 31, 2012. Outflows of $3.1 billion were principally due to distributions from our fully invested Legacy Energy funds, one of the NGP management fee funds ( NGP VIII\u201d), and U.S. real estate funds and related co-investments. Inflows of $2.1 billion were primarily related to investment activity in our power ( CPOCP\u201d) fund and related coinvestments, our infrastructure ( CIP\u201d) fund, and several of our real estate funds in the U.S., Europe and Asia that are outside of their initial investment period, in addition to commitments to CIEP I.\nTotal AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2015.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforwards of Available Capital and Fair Value of Capital, and the resulting rollforward of Total AUM.\nTable 453: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Available Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value of\nCapital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total AUM\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, As of December 31, 2012\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments (1)\n</td> <td>1,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Called, net (2)\n</td> <td>(4,013\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions (3)\n</td> <td>845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,059\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,214\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) (4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange and other (5)\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, As of December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments (1)\n</td> <td>8,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Called, net (2)\n</td> <td>(3,612\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>469\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions (3)\n</td> <td>1,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,698\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,947\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) (4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange and other (5)\n</td> <td>(67\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(289\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(356\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, As of December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments (1)\n</td> <td>3,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Called, net (2)\n</td> <td>(3,530\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>430\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions (3)\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,842\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,795\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) (4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,357\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,357\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange and other (5)\n</td> <td>(43\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(255\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents capital raised by our carry funds and NGP management fee funds, net of expired available capital. \n (2) Represents capital called by our carry funds and NGP management fee funds, net of fund fees and expenses.

Total AUM was $38.0 billion at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $4.3 billion, or 10%, compared to $42.3 billion at December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by $5.8 billion in distributions primarily related to our U.S. Real Estate, NGP Energy, and Legacy Energy funds and $2.4 billion of market depreciation, representing a 3% decrease in the value of our carry fund portfolio. Our public portfolio declined by 12% ($0.5 billion) and our private portfolio increased slightly by $0.1 billion with the remainder attributable to our coinvestment vehicles and NGP management fee funds. The carry funds driving depreciation for the period included $1.0 billion attributable to Energy IV (29% depreciation), $0.6 billion attributable to Energy III (40% depreciation), and $0.4 billion attributable to NGP X (14% depreciation), partially offset by $0.5 billion (30% appreciation) attributable to CRP VI . Offsetting this was $3.7 billion of new commitments driven by fundraising in CRP VII, NGP XI, and CPP II.\nTotal AUM was $42.3 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $3.6 billion, or 9%, compared to $38.7 billion at December 31, 2013. This increase is due to (a) commitments of $8.9 billion in CRP VII, NGP XI, CIEP I, CPP II and related coinvestment vehicles, and (b) market appreciation of $1.6 billion, despite a 2% decrease in values across the real assets carry funds due to the inclusion of the NGP management fee funds in Total AUM. Our public portfolio declined by 26% ($1.2 billion) and our private portfolio increased by 8% ($1.0 billion) with the remainder attributable to our coinvestment vehicles and NGP management fee funds. The carry funds driving depreciation for the period included $0.6 billion attributable to Energy IV (13% depreciation), $0.4 billion attributable to Energy III (21% depreciation), and $0.2 billion attributable to Energy\nII (59% depreciation), partially offset by $0.5 billion (35% appreciation) attributable to CRP VI and $0.5 billion attributable to NGP X. Offsetting this increase were net distributions of $6.9 billion, primarily in our Natural Resources and Legacy Energy fund platforms.\nTotal AUM was $38.7 billion at December 31, 2013, a decrease of $1.5 billion, or 4%, compared to $40.2 billion at December 31, 2012. The decrease was primarily due to distributions of $6.0 billion, of which approximately $0.8 billion was recycled back into available capital. This decrease was offset by commitments raised of $2.0 billion by CIEP I, CPOCP I, and various coinvestments and managed accounts in our Asia real estate funds. Market appreciation of $1.6 billion was driven by a 1% increase in values across the real assets carry funds, primarily driven by a 5% increase in our infrastructure and real estate funds. Our public portfolio increased by 5% ($0.2 billion) and our private portfolio remained relatively flat with the remainder attributable to our coinvestment vehicles and NGP management fee funds. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $0.3 billion attributable to CRP VI (42% appreciation), $0.3 billion attributable to CRP V (18% appreciation), and $0.2 billion attributable to Energy IV (4% appreciation), partially offset by $0.5 billion (19% depreciation) attributable to CEREP III.\nFund Performance Metrics\nFund performance information for our investment funds that have at least $1.0 billion in capital commitments, cumulative equity invested or total value as of December 31, 2015 and excluding the NGP management fee funds, which we refer to as our significant funds,\u201d is generally included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

the period following the formation of the first fund within each segment. For our Corporate Private Equity segment our first fund was formed in 1990. For our Real Assets segment our first fund was formed in 1997. \n (2) Represents the original cost of all capital called for investments since inception of the fund. \n (3) Represents all realized proceeds combined with remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest. \n (4) Multiple of invested capital ( MOIC\u201d) represents total fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, divided by cumulative invested capital. \n (5) An investment is considered realized when the investment fund has completely exited, and ceases to own an interest in, the investment. An investment is considered partially realized when the total amount of proceeds received in respect of such investment, including dividends, interest or other distributions and/or return of capital, represents at least 85% of invested capital and such investment is not yet fully realized. Because part of our value creation strategy involves pursuing best exit alternatives, we believe information regarding Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR, when considered together with the other investment performance metrics presented, provides investors with meaningful information regarding our investment performance by removing the impact of investments where significant realization activity has not yet occurred. Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR have limitations as measures of investment performance, and should not be considered in isolation. Such limitations include the fact that these measures do not include the performance of earlier stage and other investments that do not satisfy the criteria provided above. The exclusion of such investments will have a positive impact on Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR in instances when the MOIC and Gross IRR in respect of such investments are less than the aggregate MOIC and Gross IRR. Our measurements of Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR may not be comparable to those of other \ncompanies that use similarly titled measures. We do not present Realized/Partially Realized performance information separately for funds that are still in the investment period because of the relatively insignificant level of realizations for funds of this type. However, to the extent such funds have had realizations, they are included in the Realized/Partially Realized performance information presented for Total Real Assets.\n (6) Fully Invested funds are past the expiration date of the investment period as defined in the respective limited partnership agreement. In instances where a successor fund has had its first capital call, the predecessor fund is categorized as fully invested. \n (7) Gross Internal Rate of Return ( Gross IRR\u201d) represents the annualized IRR for the period indicated on Limited Partner invested capital based on contributions, distributions and unrealized value before management fees, expenses and carried interest. \n (8) Net Internal Rate of Return ( Net IRR\u201d) represents the annualized IRR for the period indicated on Limited Partner invested capital based on contributions, distributions and unrealized value after management fees, expenses and carried interest. \n (9) Aggregate includes the following funds: CRP I, CRP II, CAREP I, CAREP II, CRCP I, CPOCP, Energy I and Renew I. \n (10) Includes coinvestments and certain other stand-alone investments arranged by us. \n (11) Aggregate includes the following fund: NGP GAP. Returns are not considered meaningful, as the investment period commenced in December 2013 for NGP GAP. \n (12) Returns are not considered meaningful, as the investment period commenced in September 2013 for CIEP I, March 2014 for CRP VII, June 2014 for NGP XI, and June 2014 for CPP II. \n (13) For purposes of aggregation, funds that report in foreign currency have been converted to U.S. dollars at the reporting period spot rate. \nTable 473: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

As a result of our acquisition of the remaining 40% equity interest in AlpInvest on August 1, 2013, our segment results prospectively from that date reflect our 100% ownership interest in AlpInvest. Also, as a result of our acquisitions of Metropolitan on November 1, 2013 and DGAM on February 3, 2014, our segment results include the results of operations of Metropolitan and DGAM since that date.\nDuring the third week of February 2016, we decided to restructure our Investment Solutions segment to focus on private market secondaries, co-investment and managed account activities and, given the challenging market environment, discontinue our fund of hedge funds and liquid alternative initiatives. On February 19, 2016, the Partnership commenced a wind down of the operations of DGAM. While the restructuring did not impact our segment results for the year ended December 31, 2015, we expect that this action will improve our Investment Solutions segment results in the future, exclusive of costs incurred in connection with the wind down. For details of the impact of the restructuring to our U.S. GAAP results, please refer to Note 3 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table presents our results of

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Carlyle Group L.P. (the Partnership\u201d) is a Delaware limited partnership formed on July 18, 2011. The Partnership is a holding partnership and its sole material assets are equity interests through wholly owned subsidiary entities representing partnership units in Carlyle Holdings I L.P., Carlyle Holdings II L.P. and Carlyle Holdings III L.P. (collectively,\u201d Carlyle Holdings\u201d). Through wholly owned subsidiary entities, the Partnership is the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings and operates and controls all of the business and affairs of Carlyle Holdings and, through Carlyle Holdings and its subsidiaries, continues to conduct the business now conducted by these subsidiaries. Carlyle Group Management L.L.C. is the general partner of the Partnership.\nAs the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings, the Partnership consolidates the financial position and results of operations of Carlyle Holdings into its financial statements, and the ownership interests of the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships are reflected as a non-controlling interest in the Partnership's financial statements.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe conduct our operations through four reportable segments: Corporate Private Equity, Global Market Strategies, Real Assets and Investment Solutions.\n \u2022 Corporate Private Equity - Our Corporate Private Equity segment advises our 22 buyout and 10 growth capital funds, which seek a wide variety of investments of different sizes and growth potentials. As of December 31, 2015, our Corporate Private Equity segment had approximately $63 billion in AUM and approximately $41 billion in Fee-earning AUM. \n \u2022 Global Market Strategies - Our Global Market Strategies segment advises a group of 68 funds that pursue investment opportunities across structured credit, distressed debt, corporate and energy mezzanine debt, middle-market and senior debt, as well as credit, emerging markets and commodities-focused hedge funds and a mutual fund. As of December 31, 2015, our Global Market Strategies segment had approximately $35 billion in AUM and approximately $31 billion in Fee-earning AUM. \n \u2022 Real Assets - Our Real Assets segment advises our eight U.S. and internationally focused real estate funds, our infrastructure fund, our two power funds, our international energy fund, as well as our five Legacy Energy funds (funds that we jointly advise with Riverstone). The segment also includes six NGP management fee funds and three carry funds advised by NGP. As of December 31, 2015, our Real Assets segment had approximately $38 billion in AUM and approximately $31 billion in Fee-earning AUM. \n \u2022 Investment Solutions - Our Investment Solutions segment advises a global private equity fund of funds program and related co-investment and secondary activities across 118 fund of funds vehicles. As of December 31, 2015, our Investment Solutions segment had approximately $46 billion in AUM and approximately $28 billion in Fee-earning AUM.  We earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds. We also typically receive a performance fee from an investment fund, which may be either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income, which we refer to as a carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund. Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), we are required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we advise. However, for segment reporting purposes, we present revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these investment funds. Accordingly, our segment revenues primarily consist of fund management and related advisory fees, performance fees (consisting of incentive fees and carried interest allocations), investment income, including realized and unrealized gains on our investments in our funds and other trading securities, as well as interest and other income. Our segment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits expenses, including salaries, bonuses, performance payment arrangements, and equity-based compensation excluding awards granted in our initial public offering or in connection with acquisitions and strategic investments, and general and administrative expenses. Refer to Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the differences between our financial results reported pursuant to U.S. GAAP and our financial results for segment reporting purposes.\nTrends Affecting our Business\nOur results of operations, particularly our quarterly results, are affected by a variety of factors, including global economic, market and financial conditions, particularly in the United States, Europe and Asia. In general, a climate of stable interest rates and liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provides a positive environment for us to invest, develop and exit investments in our carry funds at attractive returns. Periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets also can present us with significant opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future revenue growth. For our hedge funds, opportunities to generate revenue depend on their respective investment strategies, certain of which may benefit from higher market volatility, including strategies targeted at capitalizing on low levels of correlation in equity and debt markets, differences in market prices versus fundamental value and trading inefficiencies. While our business is subject to global economic and market factors, we believe that our diversified, multi-product global platform, which invests across numerous industries, asset classes and geographies, enhances the stability of our management fee revenues and distributable earnings over the long term. Our diversified platform mitigates our exposure to a negative event associated with any specific fund, investment or vintage. Whether in stable or more volatile economic conditions, of critical importance to the success of our investments is the quality of our management teams as they actively work to monitor shifts in economic conditions and their impact on our investments.\nThe increase in financial market volatility observed over the course of 2015 and into the beginning of 2016 generally is attributable to three primary and interrelated factors: concerns regarding the economic climate in China, crude oil prices and the availability of credit. In China, there has been a significant slowdown in the industrial sector. As China accounts for nearly 25% of global manufacturing output and is a key link in global supply chains, a slowdown in China's industrial sector has a direct negative impact on global industrial orders. At the same time, the decline in Chinese demand for industrial inputs has contributed to a reduction in the capital spending of global businesses operating in the energy, metals, and mining industries because low commodity prices generally do not support new capital investment in businesses in these industries. The industrial sector of the U.S. economy is also contracting as a result of the significant reduction in energy-related capital spending. In January 2016, the Federal Reserve announced that its industrial production index declined by 0.4% in December, resulting in a full-year decline of 1.8%, the first 12-month decline in U.S. industrial output since 2009. Energy accounted for 70% of U.S. net industrial investment between 2009 and 2014 so with energy-related orders falling by 30%, many manufacturers are reporting their worst numbers since 2009.\nThe uncertainty around crude oil prices has also contributed to the increasingly uncertain investment environment and has had spillover effects across the chain of energy production, transmission, storage and consumption and has also affected the credit markets. Losses on energy related credit transactions have caused lenders, particularly in the U.S., to exercise caution in extending credit in all sectors, which has caused a tightening of credit availability for our transactions. We have not seen the same level of credit contraction in Europe and Asia and have remained quite active in those markets. In 2015, our European buyout and growth funds invested $1.0 billion in 14 transactions and our Asia buyout and growth funds and Japan buyout funds invested $1.4 billion in 13 transactions and closed 4 initial public offerings. As of December 31, 2015, we had capital available for investment through our carry funds of $44 billion. In 2015, we invested approximately $8.8 billion in new and existing investments across our carry fund portfolio, which is slightly less than our average over the last five years of $9.5 billion. Given increased competition for investments, and the effect, particularly in Europe and Asia, of the strong dollar against foreign currencies, the internal rates of return we are able to generate may be lower than our historical rates, but we continue to follow our core investment tenets and disciplined approach to make investments where we believe we can create value and achieve appreciation. We have a long-term investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year.\nThe confluence of effects from economic conditions in China, crude prices and tightening credit markets and the resulting market volatility, particularly at the beginning of 2016, also negatively impacted the value of our public portfolio, which accounts for approximately 26% of our total carry fund portfolio as of December 31, 2015. While changing valuations do not have a cash impact on our business until the investment is realized, they are reflected in the quarterly valuations of our portfolio and can adversely impact our quarterly GAAP earnings. Volatility and the corresponding heightened market uncertainty may also impact our ability to execute block trades and pursue initial public offerings as an exit strategy for our privately held portfolio companies. However, while in 2015 global IPO issuances were down 47% year-over-year on a proceeds basis and were at the lowest levels since 2009, our funds completed seven initial public offerings in 2015 as compared to six in 2014.\nRecent Transactions\nIn February 2016, the Board of Directors of our general partner declared a distribution of $0.29 per common unit to common unitholders in respect of the fourth quarter of 2015 payable on March 2, 2016 to holders of record of common units at the close of business on February 23, 2016.\nIn February 2016, the Board of Directors of the general partner of the Partnership authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of common units and/or Carlyle Holdings units. Under this unit repurchase program, units may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. We expect that the majority of repurchases under this program will be done via open market transactions. No units will be repurchased from our executive officers under this program. The timing and actual number of common units and/or Carlyle Holdings units repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price, and economic and market conditions. This unit repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date.\nKey Financial Measures\nOur key financial measures are discussed in the following pages.\nRevenues\nRevenues primarily consist of fund management fees, performance fees, investment income, including realized and unrealized gains of our investments in our funds and other trading securities, as well as interest and other income. See - Critical Accounting Policies - Performance Fees\u201d and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the manner in which management fees and performance fees are generated.\nFund Management Fees. Fund management fees include (i) management fees and (ii) transaction and portfolio advisory fees. Management fees are fees we earn for advisory services we provide to funds in which we hold a general partner interest or with which we have an investment advisory or investment management agreement. Management fees are based on (a) third parties' capital commitments to our investment funds, (b) third parties' remaining capital invested in our investment funds at cost or at the lower of cost or aggregate remaining fair value, (c) gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, (d) for the private equity and real estate fund of funds vehicles following the expiration of the commitment period or weighted-average investment period of such vehicles, the lower of cost or fair value of the capital invested, the net asset value for unrealized investments, or the contributions for unrealized investments, (e) the total par amount of assets for our CLOs and the aggregate principal amount of the notes of our other structured products, or (f) the net asset value ( NAV\u201d) of certain of our investment funds, as described in our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, management fees include catch-up management fees, which are episodic in nature and represent management fees charged to fund investors in subsequent closings of a fund which apply to the time period between the fee initiation date and the subsequent closing date.\nManagement fees for funds in our corporate private equity funds, closed-end carry funds in the global market strategies segment and real assets funds generally range from 1% to 2% of commitments during the investment period of the relevant fund. Large funds tend to have lower effective management fee rates, while smaller funds tend to have effective management fee rates approaching 2.0%. Following the expiration or termination of the investment period of such funds, the management fees generally step-down to between 0.6% and 2.0% generally on the lower of cost or fair value of capital invested; however, certain of our managed accounts base management fees at all times on contributions for unrealized investments or the current value of the investment. Depending upon the contracted terms of investment advisory or investment management and related agreements, these fees are called semiannually in advance and are recognized as earned over the subsequent six month period. As a result, cash on hand and deferred revenue will generally be higher at or around January and July, which are the semiannual due dates for management fees.\nManagement fees for our private equity and real estate fund of funds vehicles generally range from 0.3% to 1.0% on the vehicle's capital commitments during the commitment fee period of the relevant fund or the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds. Following the expiration of the commitment fee period or weighted-average investment period of such funds, the management fees generally range from 0.3% to 1.0% on the lower of cost or fair value of the capital invested, the NAV for unrealized investments, or the contributions for unrealized investments. The management fees for our fund of hedge funds vehicles generally range 0.2% to 1.5% of NAV. Management fees for our Investment Solutions segment are generally due quarterly and are recognized over the related quarter.\nOur hedge funds generally pay management fees quarterly that range from 1.5% to 2.0% of NAV per year. Management fees for our business development companies are due quarterly in arrears at annual rates that range from 0.25% to 1.0% of gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents. Management fees for our CLOs and other structured products typically range from 0.15% to 1.0% on the total par amount of assets or the aggregate principal amount of the notes in the CLO and are due quarterly or semiannually based on the terms and recognized over the relevant period. Our management fees for our CLOs/structured products and credit opportunities funds are governed by indentures and collateral management agreements.\nWith respect to Claren Road and ESG, we retain a specified percentage of the management fees of the businesses based on our economic ownership in the management companies of 55%. Through the second quarter of 2015, we retained 55% of the management fees of Carlyle Commodity Management L.L.C. ( CCM\u201d or Carlyle Commodity Management\u201d, formerly Vermillion) based on our 55% economic interest in Carlyle Commodity Management. Effective July 1, 2015, based on a restructuring of the original acquisition agreements of Carlyle Commodity Management, in which the Partnership's economic interest increased to approximately 83%, we are entitled to approximately 83% of the management fees of Carlyle Commodity Management. Management fees are not subject to repayment but may be offset to the extent that other fees are earned as described below under -Transaction and Portfolio Advisory Fee.\u201d\nManagement fees attributable to Carlyle Partners VI, L.P. ( CP VI\u201d), our sixth U.S. buyout fund with approximately $12.0 billion of Fee-earning AUM as of December 31, 2015, were approximately 15% and 14% of total management fees recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management fees attributable to Carlyle Partners V, L.P. ( CP V\u201d), our fifth U.S. buyout fund, were approximately 11% of total management fees recognized during the year ended December 31, 2013. No other fund generated over 10% of total management fees in the periods presented.\nFund management fees exclude the reimbursement of any partnership expenses paid by the Partnership on behalf of the Carlyle funds pursuant to the limited partnership agreements, including amounts related to the pursuit of actual, proposed, or unconsummated investments, professional fees, expenses associated with the acquisition, holding and disposition of investments, and other fund administrative expenses.\nTransaction and Portfolio Advisory Fees. Transaction and portfolio advisory fees are fees we receive for the transaction and portfolio advisory services we provide to our portfolio companies. When covered by separate contractual agreements, we recognize transaction and portfolio advisory fees for these services when the service has been provided and collection is reasonably assured. We are required to offset our fund management fees earned by a percentage of the transaction and advisory fees earned, which we refer to as the rebate offsets.\u201d Such rebate offset percentages generally approximate 80% of the fund's portion of the transaction and advisory fees earned. The recognition of portfolio advisory fees and transaction fees can be volatile as they are primarily generated by investment activity within our funds, and therefore are impacted by our investment pace. We have received and expect to continue to receive requests from a variety of investors and groups representing investors to increase the percentage of transaction and advisory fees we share with our investors in future funds; to the extent that we accommodate such requests on future funds, the rebate offset percentages would increase relative to historical levels.\nPerformance Fees. Performance fees consist principally of the special residual allocation of profits to which we are entitled, commonly referred to as carried interest, from certain of our investment funds, which we refer to as the carry funds.\u201d We are generally entitled to a 20% allocation (or 10% to 20% on external coinvestment vehicles, with some earning no carried interest, or approximately 2% to 10% in the case of most of our fund of funds vehicles) of the net realized income or gain as a carried interest after returning the invested capital, the allocation of preferred returns of generally 8% to 9% and the return of certain fund costs (subject to catch-up provisions as set forth in the fund limited partnership agreement). Carried interest revenue, which is a component of performance fees in our consolidated financial statements, is recognized by Carlyle upon appreciation of the valuation of our funds' investments above certain return hurdles as set forth in each respective partnership agreement and is based on the amount that would be due to us pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were liquidated at such date. Accordingly, the amount of carried interest recognized as performance fees reflects our share of the fair value gains and losses of the associated funds' underlying investments measured at their then-current fair values relative to the fair values as of the end of the prior period. As a result, the performance fees earned in an applicable reporting period are not indicative of any future period, as fair values are based on conditions prevalent as of the reporting date. Refer to - Trends Affecting our Business\u201d for further discussion. Carried interest is ultimately realized and distributed when: (i) an underlying investment is profitably disposed of, (ii) certain costs borne by the limited partner investors have been reimbursed, (iii) the investment fund's cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return and (iv) we have decided to collect carry rather than return additional capital to limited partner investors. Our decision to realize carry considers such factors as the level of embedded valuation gains, the portion of the fund invested, the portion of the fund returned to limited partner investors, and the length of time the fund has been in carry, as well as other qualitative measures. The portion of performance fees that are realized and unrealized in each period are separately reported in our statement of operations.\nUnder our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of AlpInvest, we generally do not retain any carried interest in respect of the historical investments and commitments to our fund of funds vehicles that existed as of July 1, 2011 (including any options to increase any such commitments exercised after such date). We are entitled to 15% of the carried interest in respect of commitments from the historical owners of AlpInvest for the period between 2011 and 2020 and 40% of the carried interest in respect of all other commitments (including all future commitments from third parties). In certain instances, carried interest associated with the fund of funds vehicles is subject to entity level income taxes in the Netherlands.\nOur performance fees are generated by a diverse set of funds with different vintages, geographic concentration, investment strategies and industry specialties. For an explanation of the fund acronyms used throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section, see Item 1. Business - Our Family of Funds.\u201d\nPerformance fees from Carlyle Europe Partners III, L.P. ( CEP III\u201d), Carlyle Asia Partners III ( CAP III\u201d), Carlyle Realty Partners VI, L.P. ( CRP VI\u201d), and Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy and Power Fund III, L.P. ( Energy III\u201d) (with total AUM of approximately $4.9 billion, $2.4 billion, $2.9 billion, and $0.5 billion, respectively) were $236.8 million, $184.5 million, $101.1 million, and $(100.3) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Performance fees from CP V and CEP III were $600.8 million and $584.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014. Performance fees from CP V, CEP III, and Carlyle Partners IV, L.P. ( CP IV\u201d), our fourth U.S. buyout fund, were $592.0 million, $509.1 million, and $390.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013. No other fund generated over 10% of performance fees in the periods presented.\nRealized carried interest may be clawed-back or given back to the fund if the fund's investment values decline below certain return hurdles, which vary from fund to fund. When the fair value of a fund's investments remains constant or falls below certain return hurdles, previously recognized performance fees are reversed. In all cases, each investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback obligations. For any given period, carried interest income could thus be negative; however, cumulative performance fees can never be negative over the life of a fund. In addition, we are not obligated to pay guaranteed returns or hurdles. If upon a hypothetical liquidation of a fund's investments at the then-current fair values, previously recognized and distributed carried interest would be required to be returned, a liability is established in our financial statements for the potential giveback obligation. As discussed below, each individual recipient of realized carried interest typically signs a guarantee agreement or partnership agreement that personally obligates such person to\nreturn his/her pro rata share of any amounts of realized carried interest previously distributed that are later clawed back. Accordingly, carried interest as performance fee compensation is subject to return to the Partnership in the event a giveback obligation is funded. Generally, the actual giveback liability, if any, does not become due until the end of a fund's life.\nIn addition to the carried interest from our carry funds, we are also entitled to receive incentive fees or allocations from certain of our Global Market Strategies funds when the return on AUM exceeds previous calendar-year ending or date-of-investment high-water marks. Our hedge funds generally pay annual incentive fees or allocations equal to 20% of the fund's profits for the year, subject to a high-water mark. The high-water mark is the highest historical NAV attributable to a fund investor's account on which incentive fees were paid and means that we will not earn incentive fees with respect to such fund investor for a year if the NAV of such investor's account at the end of the year is lower that year than any prior year-end NAV or the NAV at the date of such fund investor's investment, generally excluding any contributions and redemptions for purposes of calculating NAV. In these arrangements, incentive fees are recognized when the performance benchmark has been achieved based on the hedge funds' then-current fair value and are included in performance fees in our consolidated statements of operations. These incentive fees are a component of performance fees in our consolidated financial statements and are treated as accrued until paid to us.\nFor any given period, performance fee revenue on our statement of operations may include reversals of previously recognized performance fees due to a decrease in the value of a particular fund that results in a decrease of cumulative performance fees earned to date. Since fund return hurdles are cumulative, previously recognized performance fees also may be reversed in a period of appreciation that is lower than the particular fund's hurdle rate. For the years ended December 31, 2015 2014, and 2013, the reversals of performance fees were $253.4 million, $255.4 million, and $63.0 million, respectively.\nAdditionally, unrealized performance fees reverse when performance fees are realized and can be negative if the amount of realized performance fees exceed total performance fees generated in the period.\nAs of December 31, 2015, accrued performance fees and accrued giveback obligations were approximately $3.0 billion and $252.0 million, respectively, after amounts eliminated related to the Consolidated Funds. Each balance assumes a hypothetical liquidation of the funds' investments at December 31, 2015 at their then current fair values. These assets and liabilities will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the fair values of the fund investments until they are realized.\nIn addition, realized performance fees may be reversed in future periods to the extent that such amounts become subject to a giveback obligation. If at December 31, 2015, all investments held by our carry funds were deemed worthless, the amount of realized and previously distributed performance fees subject to potential giveback would be approximately $1.9 billion, on an after-tax basis where applicable. See the related discussion of Contingent Obligations (Giveback)\u201d within - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Since Carlyle's inception, we have repaid a total of approximately $53.9 million in\naggregate giveback obligations, which was funded primarily through collection of employee receivables related to giveback obligations and from non-controlling interests for their portion of the obligation.\nAs described above, each investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback obligations. As a result, performance fees within funds will continue to fluctuate primarily due to certain investments within each fund constituting a material portion of the carry in that fund. Additionally, the fair value of investments in our funds may have substantial fluctuations from period to period.\nIn addition, in our discussion of our non-GAAP results, we use the term net performance fees\u201d to refer to the performance fees from our funds net of the portion allocated to our investment professionals and certain tax expenses associated with carried interest attributable to certain partners and employees, which are reflected as performance fee related compensation expense. We use the term realized net performance fees\u201d to refer to realized performance fees from our funds, net of the portion allocated to our investment professionals and certain tax expenses associated with carried interest attributable to certain partners and employees, which are reflected as realized performance fee related compensation expense. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for the amount of realized and unrealized performance fees recognized each period. See - Segment Analysis\u201d for the realized and unrealized performance fees by segment and related discussion for each period.\nFair Value Measurement. U.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which ranks the observability of market price inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices, or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets, will generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.\nFinancial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:\nLevel I - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical instruments as of the reporting date. The type of financial instruments included in Level I include unrestricted securities, including equities and derivatives, listed in active markets. We do not adjust the quoted price for these instruments, even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price.\nLevel II - inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. The type of financial instruments in this category includes less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets, securities traded in other than active markets, government and agency securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs. Investments in hedge funds are classified in this category when their net asset value is redeemable without significant restriction.\nLevel III - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments that are included in this category include investments in privately-held entities, non-investment grade residual interests in securitizations, collateralized loan obligations, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs. Investments in fund of funds are generally included in this category.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the determination of which category within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate for any given financial instrument is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.\nThe table below summarizes the valuation of investments and other financial instruments included within our AUM, by segment and fair value hierarchy levels, as of December 31, 2015 (amounts in millions):\n\nIn certain cases, debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices, market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments.\nInvestment professionals with responsibility for the underlying investments are responsible for preparing the investment valuations pursuant to the policies, methodologies and templates prepared by our valuation group, which is a team made up of dedicated valuation professionals reporting to our chief accounting officer. The valuation group is responsible for maintaining our valuation policy and related guidance, templates and systems that are designed to be consistent with the guidance found in U.S. GAAP. These valuations, inputs and preliminary conclusions are reviewed by the fund accounting teams. The valuations are then reviewed and approved by the respective fund valuation subcommittees, which are comprised of the respective fund head(s), segment head, chief financial officer and chief accounting officer, as well as members from the valuation group. The valuation group compiles the aggregate results and significant matters and presents them for review and approval by the global valuation committee, which is comprised of our co-chief executive officers, president and chief operating officer, chief risk officer, chief financial officer, chief accounting officer, deputy chief investment officers for Corporate Private Equity, the business segment heads, and observed by the chief compliance officer, the director of internal audit, and our audit committee. Additionally, each quarter a sample of valuations is reviewed by external valuation firms.\nIn the absence of observable market prices, we value our investments using valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis. For some investments little market activity may exist. Management's determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate management's own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks. Investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity of operating companies and real estate properties, and certain debt positions. The valuation technique for each of these investments is described in Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment Income, Interest, and Other Income. Investment income, interest, and other income represent the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our principal investments, including our investments in Carlyle funds that are not consolidated, our equity method investments and other principal investments, as well as any interest and other income. Investment income (loss) also includes the related amortization of the basis difference between the carrying value of our investment and our share of the underlying net assets of the investee, as well as the compensation expense associated with compensatory arrangements provided by us to employees of our equity method investee. Realized investment income (loss) is recorded when we redeem all or a portion of our investment or when we receive or are due cash income, such as dividends or distributions. A realized investment loss is also recorded when an investment is deemed to be worthless. Unrealized investment income (loss) results from changes in the fair value of the underlying investment, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains (losses) at the time an investment is realized.\nInterest and Other Income of Consolidated Funds. Interest and other income of Consolidated Funds primarily represents the interest earned on CLO assets. However, the Consolidated Funds are not the same entities in all periods presented and may change in future periods due to changes in U.S. GAAP, changes in fund terms and terminations of funds.\nRevenue of a Consolidated Real Estate VIE. Revenue of a consolidated real estate VIE consists of revenue generated by Urbplan, which primarily is revenue earned for land development services using the completed contract method and investment income earned on Urbplan's investments. Under the completed contract method of revenue recognition, revenue is not recognized until the period in which the land development services contract is completed.\nNet Investment Gains (Losses) of Consolidated Funds. Net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds measures the change in the difference in fair value between the assets and the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds. A gain (loss) indicates that the fair value of the assets of the Consolidated Funds appreciated more (less), or depreciated less (more), than the fair value of the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds. A gain or loss is not necessarily indicative of the investment performance of the Consolidated Funds and does not impact the management or incentive fees received by Carlyle for its management of the Consolidated Funds. The portion of the net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds attributable to the limited partner investors is allocated to non-controlling interests. Therefore a gain or loss is not expected to have a material impact on the revenues or profitability of the Partnership. Moreover, although the assets of the Consolidated Funds are consolidated onto our balance sheet pursuant to U.S. GAAP, ultimately we do not have recourse to such assets and such liabilities are generally non-recourse to us. Therefore, a gain or loss from the Consolidated Funds generally does not impact the assets available to our equity holders.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation includes salaries, bonuses, equity-based compensation, and performance payment arrangements. Bonuses are accrued over the service period to which they relate.\nWe recognize as compensation expense the portion of performance fees that are due to our employees, senior Carlyle professionals, and advisors in a manner consistent with how we recognize the performance fee revenue. These amounts are accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction with the related performance fee revenue and, until paid, are recognized as a component of the accrued compensation and benefits liability. Compensation in respect of performance fees is paid when the related performance fees are realized, and not when such performance fees are accrued. The funds do not have a uniform allocation of performance fees to our employees, senior Carlyle professionals and advisors. Therefore, for any given period, the ratio of performance fee compensation to performance fee revenue may vary based on the funds generating the performance fee revenue for that period and their particular allocation percentages.\nIn addition, we have implemented various equity-based compensation arrangements that require senior Carlyle professionals and other employees to vest ownership of a portion of their equity interests over a service period of up to 42 months, which under U.S. GAAP will result in compensation charges over current and future periods. Further, in order to recruit and retain existing and future senior Carlyle professionals and other employees, we have implemented additional equity-based compensation programs that have resulted in increases to our equity-based compensation expenses, which is a trend that may continue in the future if we increase the use of deferred restricted common units. For example, in February 2016, we granted approximately 5 million deferred restricted common units across a significant number of our employees for a total estimated grant-date fair value of approximately $58 million; these awards vest over a period of 18 to 42 months. Compensation charges associated with the equity-based compensation grants issued in our initial public offering in May 2012 or grants issued in acquisitions or strategic investments are excluded from our calculation of Economic Net Income. Compensation charges associated with all equity-based compensation grants are excluded from Fee Related Earnings and Distributable Earnings.\nWe may hire additional individuals and overall compensation levels may correspondingly increase, which could result in an increase in compensation and benefits expense. As a result of acquisitions, we have charges associated with contingent consideration taking the form of earn-outs and profit participation, some of which are reflected as compensation expense. Our fundraising has increased in recent periods and, as a result, our compensation expense increased in periods in which we closed on increased levels of new capital commitments. Amounts due to employees related to such fundraising will be expensed when earned even though the benefit of the new capital and related fees will be reflected in operations over the life of the related fund.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General, administrative, and other expenses include occupancy and equipment expenses and other expenses, which consist principally of professional fees, including those related to our global regulatory compliance program, external costs of fundraising, travel and related expenses, communications and information\nservices, depreciation and amortization (including intangible asset amortization and impairment) and foreign currency transactions. We expect that general, administrative and other expenses will vary due to infrequently occurring or unusual items. Over the last three years, our general, administrative and other expenses have been relatively consistent but for the impairment of intangible assets and expenses associated with litigation matters. Also, in periods of significant fundraising, to the extent that we use third parties to assist in our fundraising efforts, our general, administrative and other expenses may increase accordingly. Additionally, we anticipate that general, administrative and other expenses will fluctuate from period to period due to the impact of foreign exchange transactions.\nWe also could incur additional expenses in the future related to our acquisitions including amortization of acquired intangibles, earn-outs to equity holders and fair value adjustments on contingent consideration issued, as well as related to our global compliance efforts. As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, we evaluate our intangible assets (including goodwill) for impairment and could record additional impairment losses in future periods.\nInterest and Other Expenses of Consolidated Funds. The interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds consist primarily of interest expenses related primarily to our CLO loans, professional fees and other third-party expenses.\nInterest and Other Expenses of a Consolidated Real Estate VIE. Interest and other expenses of a consolidated real estate VIE reflect expenses incurred by Urbplan, consisting primarily of interest expense, general and administrative expenses, compensation and benefits, and costs associated with land development services. Also included in this caption is the change in our estimate of the fair value of Urbplan's loans payable during the period.\nIncome Taxes. The Carlyle Holdings partnerships and their subsidiaries primarily operate as pass-through entities for U.S. income tax purposes and record a provision for state and local income taxes for certain entities based on applicable laws and a provision for foreign income taxes for certain foreign entities. In addition, Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. is subject to additional entity-level taxes that are reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome taxes for foreign entities are accounted for using the asset and liability method of accounting. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period in which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by federal and certain state, local and foreign tax regulators. As of December 31, 2015, our U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 2012 through 2014 are open under the normal three-year statute of limitations and therefore subject to examination. State and local tax returns are generally subject to audit from 2011 to 2014. Foreign tax returns are generally subject to audit from 2008 to 2014. Certain of our affiliates are currently under audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities.\nNon-controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities. Non-controlling interests in consolidated entities represent the component of equity in consolidated entities not held by us. These interests are adjusted for general partner allocations and by subscriptions and redemptions in hedge funds which occur during the reporting period. Non-controlling interests related to hedge funds are subject to quarterly or monthly redemption by investors in these funds following the expiration of a specified period of time or may be withdrawn subject to a redemption fee in the hedge funds during the period when capital may not be withdrawn. As limited partners in these types of funds have been granted redemption rights, amounts relating to third-party interests in such consolidated funds are presented as redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities within the consolidated balance sheets. When redeemable amounts become legally payable to investors, they are classified as a liability and included in other liabilities of Consolidated Funds in the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe record significant non-controlling interests in Carlyle Holdings relating to the ownership interests of the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. The Partnership, through wholly owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner of Carlyle Holdings. Accordingly, the Partnership consolidates the financial position and results of operations of Carlyle Holdings into its financial statements, and the other ownership interests in Carlyle Holdings are reflected as a non-controlling interest in the Partnership's financial statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEconomic Net Income. Economic net income or ENI,\u201d is a key performance benchmark used in our industry. ENI represents segment net income which includes certain tax expense associated with performance fee compensation and excludes the impact of all other income taxes, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, acquisition-related items including amortization and any impairment charges of acquired intangibles and contingent consideration taking the form of earn-outs, charges associated with equity-based compensation grants issued in May 2012 upon completion of the initial public offering or grants issued in acquisitions or strategic investments, corporate actions and infrequently occurring or unusual events. We believe the inclusion or exclusion of these items provides investors with a meaningful indication of our core operating performance. For segment reporting purposes, revenues and expenses, and accordingly segment net income, are presented on a basis that deconsolidates the Consolidated Funds. Total Segment ENI equals the aggregate of ENI for all segments. This measure supplements and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed further under Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nFee Related Earnings. Fee Related Earnings is a component of Economic Net Income and measures our operating profitability exclusive of performance fees, investment income from investments in our funds, performance fee-related compensation, equity-based compensation expense, and certain general, administrative and other expenses when the timing of any future payment is uncertain. Accordingly, Fee Related Earnings reflect the ability of the business to cover direct base compensation and operating expenses from fee revenues other than performance fees. Fee Related Earnings are reported as part of our segment results. We use Fee Related Earnings from operations to measure our profitability from fund management fees.\nDistributable Earnings. Distributable Earnings is FRE plus realized net performance fees and realized investment income. Distributable Earnings is intended to show the amount of net realized earnings without the effects of consolidation of the Consolidated Funds. Distributable Earnings is derived from our segment reported results and is an additional measure to assess performance and amounts potentially available for distribution from Carlyle Holdings to its unitholders. Distributable Earnings is evaluated regularly by management in making resource deployment decisions and in assessing performance of our four segments and for compensation. We believe that reporting Distributable Earnings is helpful to understanding our business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure that management uses to analyze our segment performance.\nOperating Metrics\nWe monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the alternative asset management industry.\nFee-earning Assets under Management\nFee-earning assets under management or Fee-earning AUM refers to the assets we manage or advise from which we derive recurring fund management fees. Our Fee-earning AUM generally equals the sum of:\n (a) for substantially all carry funds and certain co-investment vehicles where the original investment period has not expired, and for Metropolitan fund of funds vehicles during the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds, the amount of limited partner capital commitments, and for AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles, the amount of external investor capital commitments during the commitment fee period, and for the NGP management fee funds and certain carry funds advised by NGP, the amount of investor capital commitments before the first investment realization (see Fee-earning AUM based on capital commitments\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period); \n (b) for substantially all carry funds and certain co-investment vehicles where the original investment period has expired and for Metropolitan fund of funds vehicles after the expiration of the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds, the remaining amount of limited partner invested capital at cost, and for the NGP management fee funds and certain carry funds advised by NGP where the first investment has been realized, the amount of partner commitments less realized and written-off investments (see Fee-earning AUM based on invested capital\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period); \n (c) the amount of aggregate fee-earning collateral balance at par of our collateralized loan obligations ( CLOs\u201d), as defined in the fund indentures (typically exclusive of equities and defaulted positions) as of the quarterly cut-off date for each CLO, and the aggregate principal amount of the notes of our other structured products (see Fee-earning AUM based on collateral balances, at par\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period); \n (d) the net asset value of our mutual fund and the external investor portion of the net asset value (pre-redemptions and subscriptions) of our long/short credit funds, emerging markets, multi-product macroeconomic, fund of hedge funds vehicles and other hedge funds (see Fee-earning AUM based on net asset value\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period); \n (e) the gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage), excluding cash and cash equivalents of our business development companies and certain carry funds; and \n (f) for AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles where the commitment fee period has expired, and certain carry funds where the investment period has expired, the lower of cost or fair value of invested capital (see Fee-earning AUM based on lower of cost or fair value and other\u201d in the table below for the amount of this component at each period).  The table below details Fee-earning AUM by its respective components at each period.\n\n (1) Reflects limited partner capital commitments where the original investment period, weighted-average investment period, or commitment fee period has not expired. Increases of $8.8 billion from December 31, 2014 are related primarily to fundraising in our Corporate Private Equity and Real Assets funds, offset by net changes from commitments to invested capital in our Investment Solutions funds and decreases from foreign exchange of $1.0 billion. \n (2) Reflects limited partner invested capital at cost and includes amounts committed to or reserved for investments for certain Real Assets and Investment Solutions funds. Decreases of $7.4 billion from December 31, 2014 are primarily related to large distributions for funds outside their original commitment periods in our Corporate Private Equity and Real Assets segments, along with decreases for foreign exchange of approximately $0.5 billion. \n (3) Represents the amount of aggregate Fee-earning collateral balances and principal balances, at par, for our CLOs/structured products. The overall increase of $0.3 billion from December 31, 2014 is related to fundraising of $4.6 billion for nine structured products. Fundraising was offset by decreases in the collateral balances, at par, of our structured products, in addition to decreases from foreign exchange of $0.6 billion. \n (4) Reflects the net asset value (pre-redemptions and subscriptions) of our hedge funds, mutual fund and fund of hedge funds vehicles. The decrease from December 31, 2014 of $5.3 billion was due to net redemptions and market depreciation in our hedge funds and fund of hedge fund vehicles of $4.5 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively. Our hedge fund partnerships had outstanding redemption requests for $3.1 billion in the aggregate as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. Also, as disclosed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we commenced a wind down of the operations of Diversified Global Asset Management in our Investment Solutions segment in the first quarter of 2016, which had approximately $2 billion of Fee-earning AUM as of December 31, 2015. \n (5) Includes funds with fees based on gross asset value. The decrease of $1.0 billion from December 31, 2014 was primarily related to foreign exchange decreases of $1.6 billion and distributions in our funds based on lower of cost or fair value in our Investment Solutions segment. \n (6) Energy II, Energy III, Energy IV, Renew I, and Renew II (collectively, the Legacy Energy Funds\u201d), are managed with Riverstone Holdings LLC and its affiliates. Affiliates of both Carlyle and Riverstone act as investment advisers to each of the Legacy Energy Funds. With the exception of Energy IV and Renew II, where Carlyle has a minority representation on the funds' management committees, management of each of the Legacy Energy Funds is vested in committees with equal representation by Carlyle and Riverstone, and the consent of representatives of both Carlyle and Riverstone is required for investment decisions. As of December 31, 2015, the Legacy Energy Funds had, in the aggregate, approximately $6.3 billion in AUM and $5.8 billion in Fee-earning AUM. We are no longer raising capital for the Legacy Energy Funds and expect these balances to continue to decrease over time as the funds wind down. \nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Fee-earning AUM.\n\n (1) Inflows represent limited partner capital raised and capital invested by our carry funds, NGP management fee funds, and fund of funds vehicles outside the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period. Inflows do not include amounts raised of $4.5 billion for which fees have not yet commenced as of December 31, 2015. \n (2) Outflows represent limited partner distributions from our carry funds, NGP management fee funds, and fund of funds vehicles and changes in basis for our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles where the investment period, weighted-average investment period or commitment fee period has expired. \n (3) Represents the net result of subscriptions to and redemptions from our hedge funds, mutual fund and fund of hedge funds vehicles. Our hedge fund partnerships had outstanding redemption requests for $3.1 billion in the aggregate as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. Also, as disclosed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we commenced a wind down of the operations of Diversified Global Asset Management in our Investment Solutions segment in the first quarter of 2016, which had approximately $2 billion of Fee-earning AUM as of December 31, 2015. \n (4) Represents the change in the aggregate Fee-earning collateral balances at par of our CLOs/structured products, as of the quarterly cut-off dates. \n (5) Market Appreciation/ (Depreciation) represents changes in the net asset value of our hedge funds, mutual fund and fund of hedge funds vehicles, and realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles based on the lower of cost or fair value. \n (6) Includes activity of funds with fees based on gross asset value. Represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.  Refer to - Segment Analysis\u201d for a detailed discussion by segment of the activity affecting Fee-earning AUM for each of the periods presented by segment.\nAssets under Management\nAssets under management or AUM refers to the assets we manage or advise. Our AUM equals the sum of the following:\n (a) the fair value of the capital invested in Carlyle carry funds, co-investment vehicles, NGP management fee funds and fund of funds vehicles plus the capital that Carlyle is entitled to call from investors in those funds and vehicles (including Carlyle commitments to those funds and vehicles and those of senior Carlyle professionals and employees) pursuant to the terms of their capital commitments to those funds and vehicles; \n (b) the amount of aggregate collateral balance and principal cash at par or aggregate principal amount of the notes of our CLOs and other structured products (inclusive of all positions); \n (c) the net asset value (pre-redemptions and subscriptions) of our long/short credit, emerging markets, multi-product macroeconomic, fund of hedge funds vehicles, mutual fund and other hedge funds; and \n (d) the gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage) of our business development companies. \nOur carry funds are closed-ended funds and investors are generally not able to redeem their interests under the fund partnership agreements.\nWe include in our calculation of AUM and Fee-earning AUM certain energy and renewable resources funds that we jointly advise with Riverstone and certain NGP management fee funds and carry funds that are advised by NGP.\nFor our carry funds, co-investment vehicles, fund of funds vehicles, and NGP management fee funds, total AUM includes the fair value of the capital invested, whereas Fee-earning AUM includes the amount of capital commitments or the remaining amount of invested capital at cost, depending on whether the original investment period for the fund has expired. As such, Fee-earning AUM may be greater than total AUM when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is less than the cost of those investments.\nOur calculations of Fee-earning AUM and AUM may differ from the calculations of other alternative asset managers and, as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by others. In addition, our calculation of AUM includes uncalled commitments to, and the fair value of invested capital in, our funds from Carlyle and our personnel, regardless of whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to management or performance fees. Our calculations of Fee-earning AUM or AUM are not based on any definition of Fee-earning AUM or AUM that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage or advise.\nWe generally use Fee-earning AUM as a metric to measure changes in the assets from which we earn recurring management fees. Total AUM tends to be a better measure of our investment and fundraising performance as it reflects assets at fair value plus available uncalled capital.\nAvailable Capital\nAvailable capital, commonly known as dry powder,\u201d for our carry funds, fund of funds vehicles and NGP management fee funds refer to the amount of capital commitments available to be called for investments. Amounts previously called may be added back to available capital following certain distributions. Expired Available Capital\u201d occurs when a fund has passed the investment and follow-on periods and can no longer invest capital into new or existing deals. Any remaining Available Capital, typically a result of either recycled distributions or specific reserves established for the follow-on period that are not drawn, can only be called for fees and expenses and is therefore removed from the Total AUM calculation.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Available Capital and Fair Value of Capital, and the resulting rollforward of Total AUM.\n\n (1) Represents capital raised by our carry funds, NGP management fee funds and fund of funds vehicles, net of expired available capital. \n (2) Represents capital called by our carry funds, NGP management fee funds and fund of funds vehicles, net of fund fees and expenses and investments in our business development companies. Equity invested amounts may vary from capital called due to timing differences between investment acquisition and capital call dates. \n (3) Represents distributions from our carry funds, NGP management fee funds and fund of funds vehicles, net of amounts recycled and distributions from our business development companies. Distributions are based on when proceeds are actually distributed to investors, which may differ from when they are realized. \n (4) Represents the net result of subscriptions to and redemptions from our hedge funds, mutual fund, and fund of hedge funds vehicles. Our hedge fund partnerships had outstanding redemption requests for $3.1 billion in the aggregate as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. Also, as disclosed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, we commenced a wind down of the operations of Diversified Global Asset Management in our Investment Solutions segment in the first quarter of 2016, which had approximately $2 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2015. \n (5) Represents the change in the aggregate collateral balance and principal cash at par of the CLOs/structured products. \n (6) Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments and changes in the net asset value of our hedge funds, mutual fund, and fund of hedge funds vehicles. Appreciation for the fourth quarter was primarily driven by appreciation in the public portfolio of our carry funds of $1.0 billion (7%) which \nwas partially offset by depreciation in the private portfolio of our carry funds of $0.1 billion (0%). Remaining market appreciation for the fourth quarter of 2015 primarily relates to appreciation in our fund of funds vehicles of $0.8 billion, partially offset by depreciation on the NGP management fee funds of $0.7 billion. Appreciation for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by appreciation in the public portfolio of our carry funds of $2.4 billion (13%) and appreciation in the private portfolio of our carry funds of $1.2 billion (3%). Remaining market appreciation for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 primarily relates to the fund of funds vehicles ($7.7 billion), offset by depreciation on the NGP management fee funds ($1.5 billion) and hedge funds ($0.7 billion).\n (7) Represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds and other changes in AUM. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.  The table below presents the change in appreciation on portfolio investments of our carry funds. Please refer to - Segment Analysis\u201d for a detailed discussion by segment of the activity affecting Total AUM for each of the periods presented.\n (1) Carry funds only, excluding external coinvestment. \n (2) For Carlyle returns, Appreciation/Depreciation\u201d represents realized and unrealized gain / loss for the period on a total return basis before fees and expenses. The percentage of return is calculated as the sum of ending remaining investment fair market value (\"FMV\") and net investment outflow (sales proceeds less net purchases) less beginning remaining investment FMV divided by beginning remaining investment FMV. \n (3) Public portfolio includes initial public offerings (\"IPO\") that occurred in the quarter. Investments may be reported as private in quarters prior to the IPO quarter. \n (4) The MSCI ACWI - All Cap Index represents the performance of the MSCI All Country World Index across all market capitalization sizes of the global equity market. There are significant differences between the types of securities and assets typically acquired by our carry funds and the investments covered by the MSCI All Country World Index. Specifically, our carry funds may make investments in securities and other assets that have a greater degree of risk and volatility, and less liquidity, than those securities included in the MSCI All Country World Index. Moreover, investors in the securities included in the MSCI All Country World Index may not be subject to the management fees, carried interest or expenses to which investors in our carry funds are typically subject. Comparisons between the our carry fund appreciation and the MSCI All Country World Index are included for informational purposes only. \nConsolidation of Certain Carlyle Funds and Variable Interest Entities\nPursuant to U.S. GAAP, we consolidate certain Carlyle sponsored funds, related co-investment entities and CLOs that we advise, which we refer to collectively as the Consolidated Funds, in our consolidated financial statements. These funds represent approximately 13.7% of our AUM as of December 31, 2015, approximately 12% of our fund management fees and approximately 4% of our performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe are not required under U.S. GAAP to consolidate in our financial statements most of the investment funds we advise because such funds provide their limited partners with the right to dissolve the fund without cause by a simple majority vote of the non-Carlyle affiliated limited partners, which overcomes the presumption of control by Carlyle. However, we consolidate certain CLOs that we advise as a result of the application of the accounting standards governing consolidations. As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated CLOs held approximately $19 billion of total assets and comprised 71% of the assets of the Consolidated Funds and substantially all of the loans payable of the Consolidated Funds. As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles had approximately $4 billion of total assets and comprised 16% of the assets of the Consolidated Funds. The remainder of the assets of the Consolidated Funds as of December 31, 2015 primarily relate to our consolidated hedge funds and other consolidated funds. The assets and liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are generally held within separate legal entities and, as a result, the liabilities of the Consolidated Funds are non-recourse to us.\nGenerally, the consolidation of the Consolidated Funds has a gross-up effect on our assets, liabilities and cash flows but has no net effect on the net income attributable to the Partnership and partners' capital. The majority of the net economic ownership interests of the Consolidated Funds are reflected as non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, redeemable non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, and partners' capital appropriated for Consolidated Funds in the consolidated financial statements. For further information, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBecause only a small portion of our funds are consolidated, the performance of the Consolidated Funds is not necessarily consistent with or representative of the combined performance trends of all of our funds.\nIn addition, as described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of September 30, 2013, we began consolidating Urbplan, a Brazilian real estate portfolio company of certain of our real estate investment funds. Due to the timing and availability of financial information of Urbplan, we consolidate the financial position and results of operations of Urbplan on a financial reporting lag of 90 days. As of December 31, 2015, our consolidated financial statements included approximately $191 million of assets related to Urbplan.\nOn February 18, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-2, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. ASU 2015-2 provides a revised consolidation model for all reporting entities to use in evaluating whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities will be subject to reevaluation under this revised consolidation model. The revised consolidation model, among other things, (i) modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and (iii) modifies the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs through fee arrangements and related party relationships. This guidance in ASU 2015-2 is effective for us beginning on January 1, 2016. As a result, the Partnership will reduce the number of funds consolidated by the Partnership on January 1, 2016. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table and discussion sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on substantially the same basis for all historical periods presented; however, the consolidated funds are not the same entities in all periods shown due to changes in U.S. GAAP, changes in fund terms and the creation and termination of funds. We formed six CLOs in 2013, eight CLOs in 2014, and eight CLOs in 2015 and consolidated those CLOs beginning on their respective formation dates or closing dates. As further described below, the consolidation of these funds had the impact of increasing interest and other income of Consolidated Funds, interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds, and net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds in the year that the fund is initially consolidated. The consolidation of these funds had no effect on net income attributable to the Partnership for the periods presented. In addition, as described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of September 30, 2013, we began consolidating Urbplan, a Brazilian real estate portfolio company of certain of our real estate investment funds.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 and Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013.\nRevenues\nThe decrease in total revenues in 2015 and 2014 was due primarily to lower appreciation in our carry funds resulting in relatively lower performance fees. Total revenues decreased $874.1 million, or 23%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and decreased $560.9 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The following table provides the components of the changes in total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nFund Management Fees. Fund management fees decreased $81.1 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and increased $181.7 million, or 18%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to the following:\n\nIn addition, fund management fees from consolidated funds decreased $32.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and fund management fees from consolidated funds increased $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. These fees eliminate upon consolidation of these funds.\nFund management fees include transaction and portfolio advisory fees, net of rebate offsets, of $25.2 million, $73.3 million, and $50.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The decrease in transaction and portfolio advisory fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and the increase in transaction and portfolio advisory fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily due to greater investment activity, mainly in our buyout funds, in 2014 as compared to 2015 and 2013, respectively.\nPerformance Fees. Performance fees decreased $849.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 and decreased $700.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. Performance fees by segment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 comprised the following:\n\nFurther, approximately $422.1 million of our performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 were related to CEP III, CAP III, CRP VI, and Energy III, while approximately $1,184.8 million of our performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 were related to CP V and CEP III and approximately $1,491.2 million of our performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2013 were related to CP V, CEP III, and CP IV.\nGreater market volatility, influenced by China, energy prices and credit markets contributed to lower appreciation in our carry funds and our AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles. During 2015, the global economy weakened. We believe this weakness is attributable to three primary and interrelated factors: the economic climate in China, crude oil prices and the availability of credit. In China, there has been a significant reduction in the capital spending of businesses operating in the energy, metals, and mining industries due to low commodity prices, which generally do not support new capital investment in businesses in these industries. The industrial sector of the U.S. has also seen a significant reduction in energy-related capital spending. The industrial production index declined 1.8% in 2015, the first 12-month decline in U.S. industrial output since 2009. This downturn in the industrial sector has created a tightening of credit availability for transactions, resulting in market volatility. This volatility can impact our public portfolio valuations. Amongst these market conditions, our carry fund portfolio appreciated 7% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to carry fund portfolio appreciation of 15% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Furthermore, approximately $219 million in performance fees from our Legacy Energy funds and CEMOF funds were reversed during 2015.\nThe decrease in performance fees recorded in 2014 as compared to 2013 were due principally to lesser appreciation in our carry funds in 2014 as compared to 2013, as well as the lack of any significant hedge fund incentive fees during 2014 and because two corporate private equity funds, CEP III and CAP III, exceeded their performance thresholds in 2013, resulting in a cumulative catch-up of performance fees in 2013 versus performance fee accruals in 2014 at a normalized rate. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the hedge funds generated incentive fees of $145.7 million, whereas hedge fund incentive fees for 2014 were not significant. During 2014, the general economic climate started the year weaker, but by the second half of the year, the U.S. macroeconomic outlook improved with gross domestic product growth averaging nearly 4% at an annualized rate. This acceleration in growth helped to offset the 2.1% contraction in the first quarter of 2014 and bring GDP growth for the year to roughly 2.5%. Stock markets outside of the U.S. were generally weaker in 2014, with the EuroStoxx index up to 3%, the MSCI ex-U.S. index down by 5.7% and the MSCI Emerging index down by 3.5%.\nIn addition, performance fees from consolidated funds decreased $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and performance fees from consolidated funds decreased $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. These fees eliminate upon consolidation.\nInvestment Income (Loss). Investment income increased $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and decreased $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to the following:\n\nInterest and Other Income of Consolidated Funds. Our CLOs generate interest income primarily from investments in bonds and loans inclusive of amortization of discounts and generate other income from consent and amendment fees. Also included in this balance is interest income and dividend income recognized by the consolidated fund of funds vehicles and consolidated hedge funds. Substantially all interest and other income of the CLOs and other consolidated funds together with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment gains of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the related funds' limited partners or CLO investors and therefore is allocated to non-controlling interests. Accordingly, such amounts have no material impact on net income attributable to the Partnership.\nInterest and other income of consolidated funds increased $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and decreased $87.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The following table provides explanations of the changes in interest and other income of consolidated funds for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nRevenue of a Consolidated Real Estate VIE. Revenue of a consolidated real estate VIE was $86.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $70.2 million in 2014 and $7.5 million in 2013. During 2014 and throughout 2015, Urbplan completed several land development projects and, therefore, the increase in revenue of a consolidated real estate VIE in 2015 and 2014 primarily represents an increase in completed land development projects in 2015 relative to 2014 and 2014 relative to 2013. Urbplan recognizes revenue for land development services under the completed contract method. For the year ended December 31, 2013, however, substantially all of Urbplan's revenue was derived from investment income.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses decreased $307.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and increased $81.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The following table provides the components of the changes in total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nTotal Compensation and Benefits. Total compensation and benefits decreased $484.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and decreased $238.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, due to the following:\n\nBase compensation and benefits. Base compensation and benefits decreased $156.8 million, or 20%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and increased $51.0 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to the following:\n\n* On June 30, 2015, the Partnership restructured the agreements relating to the original acquisition of Carlyle Commodity Management. As a result of the restructuring, the Partnership's economic interest in Carlyle Commodity Management increased from 55% to approximately 83% effective July 1, 2015; no consideration was paid by the Partnership for the increase in economic interest. As a result of the restructuring, the estimated value of the employment-based contingent consideration liability related to Carlyle Commodity Management decreased by $46.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nEquity-based compensation. Equity-based compensation increased $34.0 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. The increase in equity-based compensation from 2014 to 2015 is due to the ongoing granting of deferred restricted common units to new and existing employees during 2014 and 2015. Also contributing to the increase in equity-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 was a decrease to the estimated forfeiture rates in the first quarter of 2015.\nEquity-based compensation increased $21.6 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase in equity-based compensation from 2013 to 2014 is due to the ongoing granting of deferred restricted common units to new and existing employees during 2013 and 2014. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in expense of $30.8 million recognized on vesting for the difference between the estimated forfeitures and actual forfeitures on Carlyle Holdings partnership units that vested during these periods.\nPerformance fee related compensation expense. Performance fee related compensation expense decreased $362.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and decreased $310.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. Performance fee related compensation expense as a percentage of performance fees was 62%, 52%, and 50% in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For our largest segment, Corporate Private Equity, our performance fee related compensation expense is generally 45%. The overall percentage of 62% for the year ended December 31, 2015 is higher than 52% for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to performance fees earned during the year by our private equity fund of funds vehicles in our Investment Solutions segment (which pay a higher ratio of performance fees as compensation) and our Legacy Energy funds within our Real Assets segment (which had carry reversals during the year without the corresponding reversal of performance fee compensation expense).\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General, administrative and other expenses increased $186.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and increased $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to:\n\n* As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, we evaluate our intangible assets (including goodwill) for impairment and could record additional impairment losses in future periods. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded an impairment loss of $15.0 million to reduce the carrying value of the intangible assets related to the fund of hedge funds within the Investment Solutions segment to their estimated fair value. During the third week of February 2016, we decided to restructure our Investment Solutions segment to focus on private market secondaries, co-investment and managed account activities and, given the challenging market environment, discontinue our fund of hedge funds and liquid alternative initiatives. On February 19, 2016, we commenced a wind down of the operations of Diversified Global Asset Management Corporation ( DGAM\u201d) and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $7.0 million in our results for the year ended December 31, 2015 that had not been previously reflected in our earnings presentation issued on February 10, 2016. In addition, we estimate we will incur between $10.0 million and $15.0 million in employee separation and other contract termination costs associated with the wind down of DGAM in 2016.\nInterest. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $58.0 million, an increase of $2.3 million from 2014. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $55.7 million, an increase of $10.2 million from 2013. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 was due primarily to the interest on $400 million and $200 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2043 issued in March 2013 and March 2014, respectively. The increase in interest expense from 2013 to 2014 was partially offset by $1.9 million of expense recorded in 2013 related to deferred financing costs expensed upon the early extinguishment of debt.\nInterest and Other Expenses of Consolidated Funds. Interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds decreased $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and increased $151.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily\ndue to lower interest expense on the consolidated hedge funds and lower other expenses on the consolidated fund of funds vehicles, substantially offset by higher interest expense on the consolidated CLOs. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 relates primarily to the additional interest expense incurred related to the six CLOs formed throughout 2013 and the eight CLOs formed in 2014.\nThe CLOs incur interest expense on their loans payable and incur other expenses consisting of trustee fees, rating agency fees and professional fees. Substantially all interest and other income of our CLOs and other consolidated funds together with interest expense of our CLOs and net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the related funds' limited partners or CLO investors and therefore is allocated to non-controlling interests. Accordingly, such amounts have no material impact on net income attributable to the Partnership.\nInterest and Other Expenses of a Consolidated Real Estate VIE. Interest and other expenses of a consolidated real estate VIE decreased $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and increased $141.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, primarily due to:\n\n* The Partnership records the Urbplan loans at fair value at each reporting period and records the change in fair value to interest and other expenses of a consolidated real estate VIE.\nAdditionally, the increase in interest and other expenses of a consolidated real estate VIE for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 includes Urbplan expenses for 2013 only for the period from September 30, 2013 (the date that the Partnership began consolidating Urbplan) through December 31, 2013, as compared to a full year of operating expenses for 2014.\nOther Non-operating (Income) Expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, this caption primarily represents the change in the fair value of contingent consideration associated with the Partnership's acquisitions. The contingent consideration arrangements are primarily associated with the Partnership's hedge fund acquisitions.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the overall estimated fair value of the contingent consideration associated with the Partnership's hedge fund acquisitions decreased based on management's assumptions in the probability-weighted discounted cash flow models used to estimate the fair value of these contingent considerations at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nGenerally, the contingent consideration associated with the Partnership's acquisitions is payable at future dates over a period of years. Because the estimated fair value of these obligations relies upon estimates of cash flows in those future periods, there will be inherent volatility in the fair value of the Partnership's liability (and as a result, the periodic expense recognized) until such time as the future cash flow projections become more definitive. However, if the financial performance of the acquisitions is consistent with, or exceeds, the Partnership's original financial forecast at acquisition, the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities will increase over time (with a corresponding expense) as the actual performance measurement date for the payment approaches.\nNet Investment Gains of Consolidated Funds.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 net investment gains of Consolidated Funds was $864.4 million, $887.0 million, and $696.7 million, respectively. This balance is driven predominantly by our consolidated AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles, CLOs, and hedge funds. For the consolidated CLOs, the amount includes the net gain or loss on the fair value adjustment of both the assets and liabilities. The components of net investment gains of consolidated funds for the respective periods are comprised of the following:\n\nThe unrealized investment gains/losses include the appreciation/depreciation of the equity investments within the consolidated AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles, the appreciation/depreciation of CLO investments in loans and bonds, as well as the appreciation/depreciation of investments made by our consolidated hedge funds and other consolidated funds. The gains/losses on the liabilities of the CLOs reflect the fair value adjustment on the debt of the CLOs.\nThe net investment gains for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were due to the following:\n\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities was $537.9 million, $485.5 million, and $676.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. These amounts are primarily attributable to the net earnings or losses of the Consolidated Funds for each period, which are substantially all allocated to the related funds' limited partners or CLO investors. This balance also includes the allocation of Urbplan's net losses that are attributable to non-controlling interests.\nThe net income of our Consolidated Funds for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 is comprised of the following:\n\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to The Carlyle Group L.P.\nThe net income (loss) attributable to the Partnership was $(18.4) million, $85.8 million, and $104.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The Partnership is allocated a portion of the monthly net income (loss) attributable to Carlyle Holdings based on the Partnership's ownership in Carlyle Holdings (which was approximately 25%, 21%, and 16% as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively). Additionally, the Partnership is allocated 100% of the net income or loss attributable to the Partnership's wholly owned taxable subsidiaries, which was net income (loss) of $29.3 million, $2.2 million, and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following table sets forth information in the format used by management when making resource deployment decisions and in assessing performance of our segments. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. The table below shows our total segment Economic Net Income which is the sum of Fee Related Earnings, Net Performance Fees, Investment Income (Loss), Reserve for Litigation and Contingencies and Equity-based compensation expense (excluding equity-based compensation grants issued in May 2012 upon the completion of the initial public offering or grants issued in acquisitions or strategic investments). Our Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of consolidated funds, acquisition-related items including amortization and any impairment charges of acquired intangible assets and contingent consideration taking the form of earn-outs, charges associated with equity-based compensation grants issued in May 2012 upon completion of the initial public offering or grants issued in acquisitions or strategic investments, changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, corporate actions and infrequently occurring or unusual events.\n\nIncome before provision for income taxes is the GAAP financial measure most comparable to economic net income, fee related earnings, and distributable earnings. The following table is a reconciliation of income before provision for income taxes to economic net income, to fee related earnings, and to distributable earnings.\n\n (1) See reconciliation to most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure below: \n\n\n (2) Adjustments to performance fees and investment income (loss) relate to (i) amounts earned from the Consolidated Funds, which were eliminated in the U.S. GAAP consolidation but were included in the Non-GAAP results, (ii) amounts attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities, which were excluded from the Non-GAAP results, and (iii) the reclassification of NGP X performance fees, which are included in investment income in the U.S. GAAP financial statements. Adjustments to investment income (loss) also include the reclassification of earnings for the investment in NGP Management to the appropriate operating captions for the Non-GAAP results, the exclusion of charges associated with the investment in NGP Management that are excluded from the Non-GAAP results and adjustments to reflect the Partnership's share of Urbplan's net losses as investment losses for the Non-GAAP results. Adjustments to performance fee related compensation expense relate to the inclusion of certain tax expenses associated with performance fee related compensation. Adjustments are also included in these financial statement captions to reflect Carlyle's 55% economic interest in each of Claren Road, ESG and, for periods prior to July 1, 2015, Carlyle Commodity Management. Effective July 1, 2015, adjustments are included to reflect the Partnership's approximate 83% economic interest in Carlyle Commodity Management. In addition, adjustments are also included to reflect, for periods prior to August 1, 2013, Carlyle's 60% economic interest in AlpInvest. \nEconomic Net Income and Distributable Earnings for our reportable segments are as follows:\n\nSegment Analysis\nDiscussed below is our ENI for our segments for the periods presented. Our segment information is reflected in the manner used by our senior management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. Included in our 2015 general, administrative and other expenses for both our U.S. GAAP financial results and ENI is a $50 million reserve for ongoing litigation and contingencies that is excluded from Fee Related Earnings and Distributable Earnings, as the timing of any payment remains uncertain. This reserve has been allocated to our business segments in accordance with our allocation policies for overhead.\nFor segment reporting purposes, revenues and expenses are presented on a basis that deconsolidates our Consolidated Funds. As a result, segment revenues from management fees, performance fees and investment income are different than those presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis because fund management fees recognized in certain segments are received from Consolidated Funds and are eliminated in consolidation when presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis. Furthermore, segment expenses are different than related amounts presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis due to the exclusion of fund expenses that are paid by the Consolidated Funds. Segment revenue and expenses are also different than those presented on a consolidated U.S. GAAP basis because we present our segment revenues and expenses related to Claren Road, ESG, and, for periods prior to July 1, 2015, Carlyle Commodity Management based on our 55% economic interest in those entities. Effective July 1, 2015, our segment revenue and expenses related to Carlyle Commodity Management are based on our approximate 83% economic interest in that entity. For periods prior to August 1, 2013 (the date we acquired the remaining 40% equity interest in AlpInvest), we present our segment revenues and expenses based on our historical ownership interest in AlpInvest of 60%. Also, ENI excludes expenses associated with equity-based compensation that was issued in our initial public offering or is issued in acquisitions and strategic investments.\nCorporate Private Equity\nThe following table presents our results of operations for our Corporate Private Equity segment:\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 and Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nDistributable Earnings\nDistributable earnings increased $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and increased $252.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013. The following table provides the components of the changes in distributable earnings for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nRealized Net Performance Fees. Realized net performance fees increased $24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and increased $131.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. Realized net performance fees were primarily generated by the following funds for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively:\n\nRealized Investment Income. Realized investment income increased $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and increased $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase in realized investment income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to higher realizations in our U.S. buyout funds. The increase in realized investment income for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher realizations in our investments in our U.S. and Europe buyout funds as well as our U.S. growth funds.\nFee Related Earnings\nFee related earnings decreased $22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and increased $119.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The following table provides the components of the change in fee related earnings for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nFee Revenues. Total fee revenues decreased $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and increased $119.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, due to the following:\n\nThe increase in fund management fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily due to a $23.4 million increase in catch-up management fees from $25.7 million in 2014 to $49.1 million in 2015. The increase in catch-up management fees was driven primarily by subsequent closings in 2015 from our fourth Europe buyout fund ( CEP IV\u201d), CJP III, and our third Europe technology fund ( CETP III\u201d), as compared to subsequent closings in 2014 from our fourth Asia buyout fund ( CAP IV\u201d) and our second global financial services fund ( CGFSP II\u201d).\nThe increase in management fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily due to CP VI and CAP IV commencing management fees in 2013 and CEP IV commencing management fees in 2014.\nThe weighted average management fee rate increased from 1.22% at December 31, 2014 to 1.26% at December 31, 2015. The increase in the weighted average management fee rate reflects new funds being raised with higher management fee rates, namely CEP IV, CAP IV, and CEOF II. Fee-earning AUM was $40.9 billion and $40.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, reflecting an increase of $0.7 billion.\nThe weighted average management fee rate increased from 1.15% at December 31, 2013 to 1.22% at December 31, 2014. The increase in the weighted average management fee rate reflects new commitments to funds with higher management fee rates, namely CAP IV and CEP IV. Fee-earning AUM was $40.2 billion and $43.0 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, reflecting a decrease of $2.8 billion.\nThe decrease in transaction fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and the increase in transaction fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily due to higher investment activity, primarily in our buyout funds, in 2014 as compared to 2015 and 2013, respectively.\nDirect and indirect compensation expense. Direct and indirect compensation expense decreased $8.5 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and lower bonuses in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in headcount as well as increased compensation costs related to fundraising activities of approximately $2.3 million, primarily related to fundraising for our second U.S. mid-market buyout fund ( CEOF II\u201d) and CEP IV.\nDirect and indirect base compensation expense increased $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or 5%, as compared to 2013. The increase is primarily due to incremental compensation related to increased headcount, promotions, and bonuses, primarily for our buyout funds. This increase was partially offset by lower compensation associated with fundraising efforts in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower negative foreign currency adjustments and lower professional fees.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease is primarily due to lower external costs associated with fundraising activities in 2014 as compared to 2013.\nEconomic Net Income\nEconomic net income decreased $462.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and decreased $192.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The following table provides the components of the change in economic net income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nPerformance Fees. Performance fees (realized and unrealized) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 are from the following types of funds:\n\nThe $686.4 million of performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 was driven primarily by performance fees recognized from the following funds:\n\u2022CEP III of $235.9 million,\n\u2022CAP III of $184.2 million,\n\u2022CP V of $67.9 million,\n\u2022CP IV of $44.4 million, and\n\u2022our first global financial services fund ( CGFSP I\u201d) of $40.7 million.\nThe $1,353.5 million of performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 was driven primarily by performance fees recognized from the following funds:\n\u2022CP V of $598.7 million, and\n\u2022CEP III of $580.2 million.\nThe $1,873.6 million of performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2013 was driven primarily by performance fees recognized from the following funds:\n\u2022CP V of $584.7 million,\n\u2022CEP III of $503.3 million,\n\u2022CP IV of $374.8 million, and\n\u2022CAP III of $163.5 million.\nPerformance fees of $686.4 million, $1,353.5 million, and $1,873.6 million are inclusive of performance fees reversed of approximately $12.3 million, $127.1 million, and $14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe appreciation in remaining value of assets for this segment by type of fund are as follows:\n\nNet performance fees as a percentage of total performance fees are as follows:\n\nUnrealized performance fees reflect the difference between total performance fees and realized performance fees. The recognition of realized performance fees results in a reversal of accumulated unrealized performance fees, generally resulting in minimal impact on total performance fees. Additionally, because unrealized performance fees can be reversed upon a realization event, in periods where the Partnership generates significant realized performance fees unrealized performance fees can be negative even in periods of portfolio appreciation.\nTotal Investment Income. Total investment income (realized and unrealized) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $18.1 million compared to investment income of $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in investment income from 2014 to 2015 relates primarily to lower appreciation on investments in certain buyout funds.\nInvestment income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $31.6 million compared to investment income of $26.2 million in 2013. The increase in investment income from 2013 to 2014 relates primarily to higher gains on investments in certain Europe buyout funds.\nEquity-based Compensation. Equity-based compensation was $65.1 million, $42.5 million, and $7.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The increase from 2014 to 2015 and the increase from 2013 to 2014 are due to the ongoing granting of deferred restricted common units to new and existing employees during 2013, 2014 and 2015, and a decrease in the estimated forfeiture rates during 2013 and 2015.\nReserve for Litigation and Contingencies. Corporate Private Equity's share of a reserve for litigation and contingencies was $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nFee-earning AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2015.\nFee-earning AUM is presented below for each period together with the components of change during each respective period.\nThe table below breaks out Fee-earning AUM by its respective components at each period.\n\n (1) For additional information concerning the components of Fee-earning AUM, see -Fee-earning Assets under Management.\u201d \n (2) Represents the aggregate effective management fee rate of each fund in the segment, weighted by each fund's Fee-earning AUM, as of the end of each period presented.  The table below provides the period to period rollforward of Fee-earning AUM.\n\n (1) Inflows represent limited partner capital raised and capital invested by carry funds outside the investment period. \n (2) Outflows represent distributions from funds outside the investment period and changes in basis for our carry funds where the investment period has expired. \n (3) Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments in our carry funds based on the lower of cost or fair value. \n (4) Represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of period end.  Fee-earning AUM was $40.9 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $0.7 billion, or 2%, compared to $40.2 billion at December 31, 2014. Inflows of $6.4 billion were primarily related to limited partner commitments raised by CEP IV, CJP III, and the activation of commitments in CEOF II. This was offset by outflows of $4.9 billion which were principally a result of distributions from several buyout funds that were outside of their investment period, in addition to the reduction in management fee basis from commitments to invested equity for funds at the end of their original investment period and $0.6 billion in foreign exchange loss. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 15% of the total external commitments raised for our global buyout fund ( CGP\u201d) in current and prior periods are reflected in fee-earning AUM, as this fund is based on invested equity. Investment and distribution activity by funds still in the investment period does not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments.\nFee-earning AUM was $40.2 billion at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $2.8 billion, or 6%, compared to $43.0 billion at December 31, 2013. Outflows of $6.5 billion were principally a result of distributions from several buyout funds that were outside of their investment period, in addition to the reduction in management fee basis for funds at the end of their original investment period and $1.3 billion in foreign exchange loss. This was offset by inflows of $4.8 billion, primarily related to limited partner commitments raised by CAP IV, CEP IV, CGFSP II, and CETP III.\nFee-earning AUM was $43.0 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $9.2 billion, or approximately 27%, compared to $33.8 billion at December 31, 2012. Inflows of $17.2 billion were primarily related to limited partner commitments raised by CP VI, CAP IV, and CGFSP II, as well as equity invested by various funds outside of their investment period. Outflows of $7.5 billion were partially driven by (a) a $3.9 billion decrease resulting from the change in basis from commitments to invested capital for CP V, CAP III, and our first global financial services fund ( CGFSP I\u201d), and (b) $3.6 billion of distributions from several funds that were outside of their investment period.\nTotal AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2015.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforwards of Available Capital and Fair Value of Capital, and the resulting rollforward of Total AUM.\n\n (1) Represents capital raised by our carry funds, net of expired available capital. \n (2) Represents capital called by our carry funds, net of fund fees and expenses. Equity invested amounts may vary from capital called due to timing differences between acquisition and capital call dates. \n (3) Represents distributions from our carry funds, net of amounts recycled. Distributions are based on when proceeds are actually distributed to investors, which may differ from when they are realized. \n (4) Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments. \n (5) Represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.  Total AUM was $63.1 billion at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $1.6 billion, or 2%, compared to $64.7 billion at December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by $13.5 billion in distributions, of which $0.7 billion is recallable, and $1.4 billion of foreign exchange loss. Offsetting this were increases of $7.9 billion from new commitments driven by fundraising in CEP IV, CEOF II, CGP, CJP III and other funds and coinvestment vehicles and $5.4 billion of market appreciation, representing a 13% increase in our portfolio of carry funds for the period. Our public portfolio appreciated 22% ($3.0 billion), our private portfolio appreciated 6% ($1.3 billion), and the remainder of our appreciation was in our coinvestment vehicles. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $1.3 billion attributable to CEP III (25% appreciation), $1.0 billion attributable to CAP III (45% appreciation), and $0.4 billion attributable to CP V (3% appreciation).\nTotal AUM was $64.7 billion at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $0.2 billion, or 0.30%, compared to $64.9 billion at December 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily driven by (a) distributions of $14.7 billion, of which $1.0 billion is recallable, and (b) foreign exchange loss of $1.9 billion. Offsetting this decrease were (a) commitments of $6.7 billion in CAP IV, CEP IV, CETP III, CGFSP II and other funds and coinvestment vehicles, and (b) a total 2014 appreciation in remaining fair value of assets of 23%, leading to market appreciation in the segment of $9.3 billion. Our public portfolio appreciated 36% ($5.6 billion), our private portfolio appreciated 12% ($2.2 billion), and the remainder of our appreciation was in our\ncoinvestment vehicles. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $3.2 billion attributable to CP V (24% appreciation), $2.8 billion attributable to CEP III (46% appreciation), and $0.4 billion attributable to CP IV (9% appreciation).\nTotal AUM was $64.9 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $11.6 billion, or approximately 22%, compared to $53.3 billion at December 31, 2012. This increase was primarily driven by (a) $11.5 billion of new commitments for several funds, including CP VI, CAP IV, CGFSP II, CSSAF I, CJP III, our Ireland fund ( CCI\u201d) and various co-investments, and (b) market appreciation across our portfolio of $10.3 billion. The total 2013 appreciation in the remaining value of assets for funds in this segment was approximately 30%, driven by a 30% increase in the buyout funds and a 32% increase in the growth funds. Our public portfolio appreciated 48% ($6.4 billion), our private portfolio appreciated 17% ($3.1 billion), and the remainder of our appreciation was in our coinvestment vehicles. The carry funds driving appreciation for the period included $3.2 billion attributable to CP V (30% appreciation), $2.1 billion attributable to CP IV (33% appreciation), and $1.8 billion attributable to CEP III (33% appreciation).\nFund Performance Metrics\nFund performance information for our investment funds that generally have at least $1.0 billion in capital commitments, cumulative equity invested or total value as of December 31, 2015, which we refer to as our significant funds,\u201d is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented. The fund return information reflected in this discussion and analysis is not indicative of the performance of The Carlyle Group L.P. and is also not necessarily indicative of the future performance of any particular fund. An investment in The Carlyle Group L.P. is not an investment in any of our funds. There can be no assurance that any of our funds or our other existing and future funds will achieve similar returns. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business Operations - The historical returns attributable to our funds, including those presented in this report, should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on an investment in our common units.\u201d\nThe following tables reflect the performance of our significant funds in our Corporate Private Equity business. See Item 1. Business - Our Family of Funds\u201d for a legend of the fund acronyms listed below.\n\n (1) The data presented herein that provides inception to date\u201d performance results of our segments relates to the period following the formation of the first fund within each segment. For our Corporate Private Equity segment our first fund was formed in 1990. \n (2) Represents the original cost of all capital called for investments since inception of the fund. \n (3) Represents all realized proceeds combined with remaining fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest. \n (4) Multiple of invested capital ( MOIC\u201d) represents total fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, divided by cumulative invested capital. \n (5) An investment is considered realized when the investment fund has completely exited, and ceases to own an interest in, the investment. An investment is considered partially realized when the total amount of proceeds received in respect of such investment, including dividends, interest or other distributions and/or return of capital, represents at least 85% of invested capital and such investment is not yet fully realized. Because part of our value creation strategy involves pursuing best exit alternatives, we believe information regarding Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR, when considered together with the other investment performance metrics presented, provides investors with meaningful information regarding our investment performance by removing the impact of investments where significant realization \nactivity has not yet occurred. Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR have limitations as measures of investment performance, and should not be considered in isolation. Such limitations include the fact that these measures do not include the performance of earlier stage and other investments that do not satisfy the criteria provided above. The exclusion of such investments will have a positive impact on Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR in instances when the MOIC and Gross IRR in respect of such investments are less than the aggregate MOIC and Gross IRR. Our measurements of Realized/Partially Realized MOIC and Gross IRR may not be comparable to those of other companies that use similarly titled measures. We do not present Realized/Partially Realized performance information separately for funds that are still in the investment period because of the relatively insignificant level of realizations for funds of this type. However, to the extent such funds have had realizations, they are included in the Realized/Partially Realized performance information presented for Total Corporate Private Equity.\n (6) Fully Invested funds are past the expiration date of the investment period as defined in the respective limited partnership agreement. In instances where a successor fund has had its first capital call, the predecessor fund is categorized as fully invested. \n (7) Gross Internal Rate of Return ( Gross IRR\u201d) represents the annualized IRR for the period indicated on Limited Partner invested capital based on contributions, distributions and unrealized value before management fees, expenses and carried interest. \n (8) Net Internal Rate of Return ( Net IRR\u201d) represents the annualized IRR for the period indicated on Limited Partner invested capital based on contributions, distributions and unrealized value after management fees, expenses and carried interest. \n (9) Aggregate includes the following funds: CP I, CMG, CVP I, CVP II, CUSGF III, CEVP, CETP I, CAVP I, CAVP II, CAGP III, Mexico, and MENA. \n (10) Includes coinvestments and certain other stand-alone investments arranged by us. \n (11) Aggregate includes the following funds: CGP, CSABF, CSSAF, CPF I, CCI, and CETP III. \n (12) Returns are not considered meaningful, as the investment period commenced in May 2012 for CP VI, November 2012 for CAP IV, April 2013 for CGFSP II, August 2013 for CEP IV, August 2014 for CJP III, and March 2015 for CEOF II. \n (13) For purposes of aggregation, funds that report in foreign currency have been converted to U.S. dollars at the reporting period spot rate. \n\n (1) Net asset value of our carry funds. Reflects significant funds with remaining fair value of greater than $100 million. \n (2) Unrealized multiple of invested capital ( MOIC\u201d) represents remaining fair market value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, divided by investment cost. \n (3) Total MOIC represents total fair value, before management fees, expenses and carried interest, divided by cumulative invested capital. For certain funds, represents the original cost of investments net of investment-level recallable proceeds, which is adjusted to reflect recyclability of invested capital for the purpose of calculating the fund MOIC. \n (4) Represents cumulative equity invested as of the reporting period divided by total commitments. Amount can be greater than 100% due to the re-investment of recallable distributions to fund investors. \n (5) Fund has accrued carry/(clawback) as of the reporting period. \n (6) Fund has realized carry in the last twelve months. \n (7) Represents the date of the first capital contribution for management fees. \n (8) Aggregate includes the following funds: CMG, CP I, CP II, CP III, CEP I, CAP I, CBPF, CJP I, CEVP, CETP I, CETP III, CCI, CAVP I, CAVP II, CAGP III, Mexico, MENA, CSABF, CSSAF, CPF, CGP, CVP I, CVP II, and CUSGF III.

Effective July 1, 2015, our results of operations for this segment reflects our approximate 83% economic interest of Carlyle Commodity Management. The following table presents our results of operations for our Global Market Strategies segment:\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 and Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nDistributable Earnings\nThe decrease in Distributable Earnings in 2015 was primarily driven by lower Fee Related Earnings and the decrease in 2014 was primarily driven by lower realized performance fees. Distributable earnings decreased $52.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and decreased $122.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The following table provides the components of the changes in distributable earnings for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nRealized Net Performance Fees. Realized net performance fees increased $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and decreased $91.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The majority of realized net performance fees were generated by the following funds for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively:\n\nRealized Investment Income. Realized investment income decreased $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and decreased $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease in realized investment income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower realizations on our distressed debt funds. The decrease in realized investment income for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to lower realizations in our investments in one of our business development companies.\nFee Related Earnings\nFee related earnings decreased $52.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and decreased $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The following table provides the components of the change in fee related earnings for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nFee Revenues. Total fee revenues decreased $49.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and decreased $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, due to the following:\n\nThe decrease in fund management fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily from the hedge funds as a result of $4.3 billion of net redemptions in 2015 and depreciation that reduced total hedge fund assets under management from approximately $13.4 billion at December 31, 2014 to approximately $8.3 billion at December 31, 2015.\nThe decrease in fund management fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily due to the absence in 2014 of approximately $10.0 million of catch-up\u201d management fees earned from subsequent closings of our third distressed and corporate opportunities fund ( CSP III\u201d) during the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately $7.4 million in subordinated management fees recognized in 2013 from two CLOs that were liquidated in 2013, and lower AUM in the Carlyle Commodity Management hedge funds. Offsetting these decreases were increases in management fees from the Claren Road and ESG hedge funds from greater assets under management of $16.3 million.\nThe weighted average management fee rate on our hedge funds decreased from 1.73% at December 31, 2014 to 1.59% at December 31, 2015 due to reduced AUM from net redemptions in our Claren Road funds, which charge a higher rate. The weighted average management fee rate on our carry funds decreased from 1.48% at December 31, 2014 to 1.38% at December 31, 2015 due to the reduction in both the fee basis and rate of CSP III and CEMOF I as they switched from commitments to invested equity at the end of their respective original investment periods.\nThe weighted average management fee rate on our hedge funds decreased from 1.77% at December 31, 2013 to 1.73% at December 31, 2014 due to higher AUM in the ESG hedge funds, which charge a lower rate, and decreases in AUM in the Carlyle Commodity Management hedge funds. The weighted average management fee rate on our carry funds decreased from 1.53% at December 31, 2013 to 1.48% at December 31, 2014 due to a step down in fee basis from commitments to invested capital on our second corporate mezzanine fund ( CMP II\u201d).\nDirect and indirect compensation expense. Direct and indirect compensation expense decreased $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower headcount and bonuses in 2015, partially offset by incremental compensation costs of $4.5 million related to fundraising activities, primarily associated with our second energy mezzanine fund ( CEMOF II\u201d).\nDirect and indirect base compensation increased $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013, which primarily relates to incremental compensation costs related to increased headcount, promotions, and bonuses.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses increased $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to higher external costs associated with fundraising activities of $10.4 million, mostly related to our second energy mezzanine fund, partially offset by lower negative foreign currency adjustments.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The decrease is primarily due to higher external costs associated with fundraising activities for the business development companies and for carry funds during 2013 as compared to 2014.\nEconomic Net Income (Loss)\nEconomic net income (loss) decreased $155.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and decreased $112.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The following table provides the components of the change in economic net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nPerformance Fees. Performance fees (realized and unrealized) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 are from the following types of funds:\n\nThe $(25.1) million of performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 was driven primarily by performance fees recognized from the following funds:\n\u2022our first energy mezzanine fund ( CEMOF\u201d) of $(43.1) million,\n\u2022CMP II of $(19.3) million, and\n\u2022ESG funds of $7.3 million.\nThe $112.5 million of performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 was driven primarily by performance fees recognized from the following funds:\n\u2022CSP III of $34.4 million,\n\u2022CEMOF of $29.6 million, and\n\u2022CMP II of $27.9 million.\nThe $184.3 million of performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2013 was driven primarily by performance fees recognized from the following funds:\n\u2022Claren Road Master Fund of $39.9 million,\n\u2022ESG Cross Border Equity Fund of $39.6 million,\n\u2022our second distressed and corporate opportunities fund ( CSP II\u201d) of $38.3 million, and\n\u2022Claren Road Opportunities Fund of $19.1 million.\nPerformance fees of $(25.1) million, $112.5 million, and $184.3 million are inclusive of performance fees reversed of approximately $63.1 million, $12.0 million, and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe appreciation (depreciation) in remaining value of assets for this segment's carry funds are as follows:\n\nNet performance fees decreased $73.7 million to $(14.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $59.7 million in 2014. Net performance fees decreased $68.8 million to $59.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $128.5 million in 2013.\nTotal Investment Income (Loss). Total investment loss (realized and unrealized) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $10.3 million compared to investment income of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in investment income from 2014 to 2015 relates primarily to depreciation on U.S.-denominated collateralized loan obligations as well as investment losses in 2015 in CEMOF as compared to investment income in 2014.\nTotal investment income was $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to investment income of $16.0 million in 2013. The decrease in investment income was due primarily to a realization of a debt investment in 2013 that resulted in a net investment gain of approximately $4.7 million. Also contributing to the decrease was lower appreciation on our CLO investments in 2014 as compared to 2013, which resulted in a decrease in investment income of $4.2 million from 2013 to 2014.\nEquity-based Compensation. Equity-based compensation was $19.0 million, $13.9 million, and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The increase from 2014 to 2015 and the increase from 2013 to 2014 are due to the ongoing granting of deferred restricted common units to new and existing employees during 2013, 2014 and 2015, and a decrease in the estimated forfeiture rates during 2013 and 2015.\nReserve for Litigation and Contingencies. Global Market Strategies' share of a reserve for litigation and contingencies was $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nFee-earning AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2015.\nFee-earning AUM is presented below for each period together with the components of change during each respective period.\nThe table below breaks out Fee-earning AUM by its respective components at each period.\n\n (1) For additional information concerning the components of Fee-earning AUM, see -Fee-earning Assets under Management.\u201d \n (2) Includes funds with fees based on notional value and gross asset value. \n (3) Represents the aggregate effective management fee rate for carry funds and hedge funds, weighted by each fund's Fee-earning AUM, as of the end of each period presented. Management fees for CLOs are based on the total par amount of the assets (collateral) in the fund and are not calculated as a percentage of equity and are therefore not included.  The table below provides the period to period rollforward of Fee-earning AUM.\n\n (1) Inflows represent limited partner capital raised and capital invested by our carry funds outside the investment period and investments in our business development companies. \n (2) Outflows represent limited partner distributions from our carry funds and changes in basis for our carry funds where the investment period has expired and distributions from our business development companies. \n (3) Represents subscriptions and redemptions in our hedge funds and mutual fund. Our hedge fund partnerships had outstanding redemption requests for $3.1 billion in the aggregate as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. \n (4) Represents the change in the aggregate Fee-earning collateral balances at par of our CLOs/structured products, as of the quarterly cut-off dates. \n (5) Market Appreciation/ (Depreciation) represents changes in the net asset value of our hedge funds and mutual fund. \n (6) Represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds and other changes in Total AUM. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end. \nFee-earning AUM was $31.0 billion at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $2.9 billion, or 9%, compared to $33.9 billion at December 31, 2014. This was driven by $4.3 billion of net redemptions in our hedge funds, $1.0 billion of net outflows including distributions, primarily due to the change in basis from commitments to invested equity in CSP III and our first energy mezzanine fund ( CEMOF I\u201d), and $0.7 billion in market depreciation. This was partially offset by $2.4 billion of inflows, including commitments, primarily driven by new commitments in CEMOF II and a $0.9 billion increase in the collateral balances of our CLO's. Distributions from carry funds still in the investment period do not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments and not invested capital.\nFee-earning AUM was $33.9 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $0.5 billion, or 1%, compared to $33.4 billion at December 31, 2013. This was driven by a $1.9 billion increase in the aggregate par value of our CLO collateral balances as a result of the eight new CLOs issued during the year and $0.8 billion of subscriptions, net of redemptions in our hedge funds. These increases are offset by $1.5 billion in market depreciation, primarily in our hedge funds and $0.5 billion in distributions from our fully invested carry funds.\nFee-earning AUM was $33.4 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $2.4 billion, or 8%, compared to $31.0 billion at December 31, 2012. This increase was driven by $1.0 billion of subscriptions, net of redemptions, market appreciation of $0.8 billion in our hedge funds and $0.6 billion of new commitments raised by our carry funds. These increases are offset by $0.5 billion in distributions from our fully invested carry funds.\nTotal AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2015.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforwards of Available Capital and Fair Value of Capital, and the resulting rollforward of Total AUM.\n\n (1) Represents capital raised by our carry funds, net of expired available capital. \n (2) Represents capital called by our carry funds and business development companies, net of fund fees and expenses. Equity invested amounts may vary from capital called due to timing differences between acquisition and capital call dates. \n (3) Represents distributions from our carry funds and business development companies, net of amounts recycled. Distributions are based on when proceeds are actually distributed to investors, which may differ from when they are realized. \n (4) Represents the net result of subscriptions to and redemptions from our hedge funds and mutual fund. Our hedge fund partnerships had outstanding redemption requests for $3.1 billion in the aggregate as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. \n (5) Represents the change in the aggregate collateral balance and principal cash and principal notes at par of the CLOs/structured products. \n (6) Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) represents realized and unrealized gains (losses) on portfolio investments and changes in the net asset value of our hedge funds. \n (7) Represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds and other changes in AUM. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end. \n (8) Ending balance is comprised of approximately $19.4 billion from our structured credit /other structured product funds, $8.3 billion in our hedge funds, $6.2 billion (including $3.8 billion of Available Capital) in our carry funds, and $1.4 billion from our business development companies.  Total AUM was $35.3 billion at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $1.4 billion, or 4%, compared to $36.7 billion at December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by $4.4 billion in net redemptions from our hedge funds, $0.9 billion of market depreciation, representing a 8% ($0.2 billion) decrease on our portfolio of carry funds for the period and declines in our hedge funds, and $0.4 billion of foreign exchange decreases in our Euro-denominated CLOs. Offsetting these decreases were $2.7 billion of new commitments driven by fundraising in CEMOF II and $1.6 billion increases in the par value of our CLO collateral balances.\nTotal AUM was $36.7 billion at December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 4%, compared to $35.5 billion at December 31, 2013. This increase was driven by (a) changes in the aggregate par value of our CLO collateral balances of $2.1 billion, primarily due to eight new issue CLOs raised, and (b) commitments of approximately $0.2 billion related to our carry funds and their related coinvestments. These increases were partially offset by market depreciation of $1.2 billion, representing declines in our hedge funds partially offset by a 20% ($0.4 billion) increase on our portfolio of carry funds for the period, and distributions in our carry funds of $0.9 billion, of which $0.5 billion was recycled back into available capital. Increases due to subscriptions, net of redemptions, to our hedge funds of $0.9 billion in 2014 are exclusive of approximately $2.2 billion of net redemption notifications effective January 1, 2015.\nTotal AUM was $35.5 billion at December 31, 2013, an increase of $3.0 billion, or approximately 9%, compared to $32.5 billion at December 31, 2012. This increase was driven by (a) market appreciation of $1.4 billion, representing increases in our hedge funds coupled with a 28% ($0.5 billion) increase on our portfolio of carry funds for the period, (b) subscriptions, net of redemptions, to our hedge funds of $1.0 billion, (c) new commitments to our CSP III carry fund of approximately $0.3 billion, and (d) six new issue CLOs raised totaling $3.1 billion, offset by the liquidation of certain existing CLOs in accordance with their business plans. These increases were partially offset by distributions in our carry funds of $1.1 billion, of which $0.3 billion was recycled back into available capital.\nFund Performance Metrics\nFund performance information for certain of our Global Market Strategies Funds is included throughout this discussion and analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented.

The following table presents our results of operations for our Real Assets segment:\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 and Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nDistributable Earnings\nDistributable earnings increased $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and increased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The following table provides the components of the change in distributable earnings for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nRealized Net Performance Fees. Realized net performance fees increased $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and increased $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The majority of realized net performance fees were generated by the following funds for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively:\n\nRealized Investment Loss. Realized investment loss increased $61.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, and realized investment loss increased $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase in realized investment loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily represented the realization of Carlyle's cumulative losses from our guarantee of liabilities of Carlyle Europe Real Estate Partners I. L.P. ( CEREP I\u201d) associated with an adverse court judgment in a French tax court proceeding of $80 million, offset by $9.7 million of lower realized investment losses in 2015 associated with Urbplan.\nThe increase in realized investment loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to realized investment losses on Urbplan and a mezzanine loan investment to one of our European real estate funds, partially offset by an investment gain from the sale of a European real estate investment.\nFee Related Earnings\nFee related earnings increased $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and declined $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The following table provides the components of the change in fee related earnings for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nFee Revenues. Total fee revenues increased $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and increased $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013, due to the following:\n\nThe increase in fund management fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily reflects a $16.2 million increase in catch-up management fees from $7.6 million in 2014 to $23.8 million in 2015. The increase in catch-up management fees is primarily due from subsequent closings on our seventh U.S. real estate fund ( CRP VII\u201d), our first international energy fund ( CIEP I\u201d) and our second power fund ( CPP II\u201d). Also, the increase in fund management fees was due to the commencement of the investment period of CRP VII and CPP II in June 2014 when both funds began to charge management fees at such time, as well as higher assets under management from additional commitments raised during 2014 and 2015 in CRP VII, CIEP I, and CPP II. These increases were partially offset by declines in fund management fees from distributions from certain other U.S. and European real estate funds outside of their investment periods, which had the effect of lowering the management fee base of those funds.\nThe increase in management fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013 is primarily due $40.9 million of incremental management fees earned in 2014 from CIEP I, which commenced its investment period in September 2013, including catch-up management fees earned in 2014 from subsequent closings of that fund of approximately $14.4 million. Also contributing to the increase was $16.1 million of incremental management fees from the commencement of management fees on CRP VII in 2014, which includes $3.3 million of catch-up management fees from subsequent closings of that fund. This increase was partially offset by declines in management fees from distributions from certain other U.S. and European real estate funds and NGP management fee funds outside of their investment periods.\nThe total weighted average management fee rate declined to 1.24% at December 31, 2015 from 1.31% at December 31, 2014 primarily due to new commitments to CRP VII and CPP II which charges a lower management fee rate compared to other funds. The weighted average management fee rate for funds in the investment period declined to 1.44% at December 31, 2015 from 1.54% at December 31, 2014 primarily due to fundraising in CRP VII and CPP II.\nThe total weighted average management fee rate increased to 1.31% at December 31, 2014 from 1.18% at December 31, 2013, primarily due to commitments to CRP VII and CIEP I. Despite the step down from commitments to invested capital in one of our Legacy Energy funds ( Renew II\u201d), from which we are entitled a 10% allocation of management fee related revenues, the weighted average management fee rate for funds in the investment period increased from 1.27% at December 31, 2013 to 1.54% at December 31, 2014 due to fundraising in CIEP I and CRP VII, from which we are entitled to 100% of management fee related revenues.\nDirect and indirect compensation expense. Direct and indirect compensation expense declined $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower bonuses in 2015 as well as lower compensation associated with fundraising of $7.1 million in 2015 versus 2014, driven by fundraising activities in 2014 related to CRP VII and CIEP I.\nDirect and indirect base compensation increased $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase in compensation was due primarily to increased compensation associated with fundraising efforts for CRP VII and NGP carry funds, as well as incremental compensation costs related to increased headcount, promotions, and bonuses.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses. General, administrative and other indirect expenses decreased $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to a decrease of $7.1 million in external costs associated with fundraising activities.\nGeneral, administrative and other indirect expenses increased $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The increase primarily relates to an increase in external costs associated with fundraising activities for CRP VII and CIEP I, as well as an increase in professional fees associated with CIEP I.\nEconomic Net Income (Loss)\nEconomic net income increased $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 and economic net loss increased $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 2013. The following table provides the components of the change in economic net income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n\nPerformance Fees. Performance fees (realized and unrealized) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 are from the following types of funds:\n\nThe $120.7 million of performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 was driven primarily by performance fees recognized from the following funds:\n\u2022CRP VI of $101.1 million,\n\u2022our fifth U.S. real estate fund ( CRP V\u201d) of $73.9 million,\n\u2022our third U.S. real estate fund ( CRP III\u201d) of $22.9 million,\n\u2022Energy III of $(38.7) million, and\n\u2022Carlyle/Riverstone Global Energy and Power Fund IV ( Energy IV\u201d) of $(37.8) million.\nThe $49.0 million of performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 was driven primarily by performance fees recognized from the following funds:\n\u2022CRP VI of $98.5 million, and\n\u2022NGP Natural Resources X, L.P. of $(39.2) million.\nThe $83.9 million of performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2013 was driven primarily by performance fees recognized for CRP VI of $76.2 million.\nPerformance fees of $120.7 million, $49.0 million, and $83.9 million are inclusive of performance fees reversed of approximately $102.8 million, $92.5 million, and $39.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe appreciation (depreciation) in remaining value of assets for this segment by type of fund are as follows:\n\nNet performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $25.9 million, representing an increase of $39.1 million from $(13.2) million in net performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in net performance fees primarily relates to our real estate funds which appreciated 27% for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to appreciation of 18% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $(13.2) million, representing a decline of $44.4 million from $31.2 million in net performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nTotal Investment Income (Loss). Total investment loss (realized and unrealized) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $30.5 million compared to total investment loss of $47.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The 2015 investment loss of $30.5 million was due primarily to $34 million in losses from our guarantee of liabilities of CEREP I associated with an adverse court judgment in a French tax court proceeding related to a transaction that CEREP I exited\nbetween 2007 and 2009. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The 2014 investment loss of $47.9 million was due primarily to unrealized losses associated with the guarantee of liabilities of CEREP I associated with the French tax court matter of $11.2 million, investment losses on certain other European real estate investments of $30.8 million, and losses associated with Urbplan of $24.3 million, partially offset by an investment gain of $22.5 million from the sale of another European real estate investment.\nTotal investment loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $47.9 million compared to an investment loss of $85.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decline in investment loss from 2013 to 2014 was due primarily to net investment losses on certain European real estate investments of $23.6 million in 2014 versus $76.6 million in 2013. This decline was offset by higher investment losses related to Urbplan, which were $24.3 million in 2014 versus $11.8 million in 2013.\nEquity-based Compensation. Equity-based compensation was $25.0 million, $19.2 million, and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The increase from 2014 to 2015 and the increase from 2013 to 2014 are due to the ongoing granting of deferred restricted common units to new and existing employees during 2013, 2014 and 2015, and a decrease in the estimated forfeiture rates during 2013 and 2015.\nReserve for Litigation and Contingencies. Real Assets' share of a reserve for litigation and contingencies was $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nFee-earning AUM as of and for each of the Three Years in the Period Ended December 31, 2015.\nFee-earning AUM is presented below for each period together with the components of change during each respective period.\nThe table below breaks out Fee-earning AUM by its respective components at each period.\n\n (1) For additional information concerning the components of Fee-earning AUM, See -Fee-earning Assets under Management.\u201d \n (2) Includes amounts committed to or reserved for investments for certain real estate funds. \n (3) Includes certain funds that are calculated on gross asset value. \n (4) Energy II, Energy III, Energy IV, Renew I, and Renew II (collectively, the Legacy Energy Funds\u201d), are managed with Riverstone Holdings LLC and its affiliates. Affiliates of both Carlyle and Riverstone act as investment advisers to each of the Legacy Energy Funds. With the exception of Energy IV and Renew II, where Carlyle has a minority representation on the funds' management committees, management of each of the Legacy Energy Funds is vested in committees with equal representation by Carlyle and Riverstone, and the consent of representatives of both Carlyle and Riverstone is required for investment decisions. As of December 31, 2015, the Legacy Energy Funds had, in the aggregate, approximately $6.3 billion in AUM and $5.8 billion in Fee-earning AUM. NGP VII, NGP VIII, NGP IX, or in the case of NGP M&R, NGP ETP I, and NGP ETP II, certain affiliated entities (collectively, the NGP management fee funds\u201d) and NGP X, NGP GAP and NGP XI (referred to herein as, \"carry funds\"), are managed by NGP Energy Capital Management. As of December 31, 2015, the NGP management fee funds and carry funds had, in the aggregate, approximately $12.4 billion in AUM and $11.5 billion in Fee-earning AUM. \n (5) Represents the aggregate effective management fee rate of each fund in the segment, weighted by each fund's Fee-earning AUM, as of the end of each period presented. Calculation reflects Carlyle's 10% interest in management fees \nearned by the Legacy Energy funds and 47.5% interest (2013 and 2014) and 55% interest (2015) in management fees earned by the NGP management fee funds and carry funds. Accounts based on gross asset base generally have an effective management fee rate of 0.5% or less.\nThe table below provides the period to period rollforward of Fee-earning AUM.\n\n (1) Inflows represent limited partner capital raised and capital invested by funds outside the investment period. \n (2) Outflows represent distributions from funds outside the investment period and changes in basis for our carry funds where the investment period has expired. \n (3) Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) represents changes in the net asset value of our fund of funds vehicles based on the lower of cost or fair value. \n (4) Represents the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated funds. Activity during the period is translated at the average rate for the period. Ending balances are translated at the spot rate as of the period end.  Fee-earning AUM was $30.9 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $2.5 billion, or 9%, compared to $28.4 billion at December 31, 2014. This increase was driven by inflows of $8.4 billion primarily related to new commitments in CRP VII, CPP II, and CIEP I as well as the activation of previously raised commitments in NGP XI. This increase was partially offset by outflows of $5.7 billion, primarily related to distribution activity in our funds outside the original investment period in addition to the reduction in management fee basis for funds at the end of their original investment period. Investment and distribution activity by funds still in the original investment period do not impact Fee-earning AUM as these funds are based on commitments and not invested capital. Changes in fair value have no impact on Fee-earning AUM for Real Assets as all of the funds generate management fees based on either commitments or invested capital at cost, neither of which is impacted by fair value movements.\nFee-earning AUM was relatively unchanged at $28.4 billion for the periods ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Outflows of $5.9
