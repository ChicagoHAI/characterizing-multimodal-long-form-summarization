Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAbout SpartanNash\nSpartanNash, headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is a leading multi-regional grocery distributor and grocery retailer whose core businesses include distributing grocery products to a diverse group of independent and chain retailers, its corporate owned retail stores, and military commissaries and exchanges in the United States. The Company operates three reportable business segments: Food Distribution, Military and Retail.\nThe Company's Food Distribution segment provides a wide variety of nationally branded and private brand grocery products and perishable food products to approximately 2,100 independent retailers, the Company's corporate owned retail stores, food service distributors and various other customers. Through its Food Distribution segment, the Company also services national retailers, including Dollar General. Sales to Dollar General are made to more than 15,500 of its retail locations. Combined with the Military segment, the Company currently services customers in all 50 states. The Company processes fresh-cut fruits and vegetables and other value-added meal solutions and supplies these products to grocery retailers and food service distributors. Through the Fresh Kitchen facility, the Company processes, cooks and packages fresh protein-based foods and complete meal solutions for a number of different customers.\nThe Company's Military segment contracts with manufacturers to distribute a wide variety of grocery products, including dry groceries, beverages, meat, and frozen foods, primarily to military commissaries and exchanges located in the United States, the District of Columbia, Europe, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Bahrain, Djibouti and Egypt. The Company is also the DeCA exclusive worldwide supplier of private brand grocery and related products to U.S. military commissaries. The Company has over 40 years of experience acting as a distributor to U.S. military commissaries and exchanges.\nThe Company's Retail segment operated 139 corporate owned retail stores in the Midwest region primarily under the banners of Family Fare Supermarkets, D&W Fresh Markets, VG's Grocery, Dan's Supermarket and Family Fresh Market as of December 29, 2018. The Company also offered pharmacy services in 82 of its corporate owned stores (of which 72 pharmacies are owned) and operated 29 fuel centers. The retail stores have a neighborhood market\u201d strategy that focuses on value beyond price, affordable wellness, and commitment to local products.\nThe Company's fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to December 31. The following discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ending or ended December 28, 2019 ( 2019\u201d), December 29, 2018 (\"2018\" or current year\u201d), December 30, 2017 ( 2017\u201d or prior year\u201d) and December 31, 2016 ( 2016\u201d), all of which include 52 weeks. All fiscal quarters are 12 weeks, except for the Company's first quarter, which is 16 weeks and will generally include the Easter holiday. The fourth quarter includes the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, and depending on the fiscal year end, may include the New Year's holiday.\nIn certain geographic areas, the Company's sales and operating performance may vary with seasonality. Many stores are dependent on tourism, and therefore, are most affected by seasons and weather patterns, including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of snowfall during the winter months and the range of temperature during the summer months.\nOverview of 2018\nIn 2018, the Company executed against its long-term strategic objective of becoming a growth company that is focused on developing a national, highly efficient distribution platform known for solving unique and complex logistical issues and evolving its primary retail brand to deliver innovative solutions, both of which service a diverse customer base. The Company also began a company-wide initiative late in the fourth quarter to drive sustainable profit improvements.\nThe Company's 2018 accomplishments and developments include:\nFood Distribution\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> During 2018, the Company expanded its supply chain capabilities to provide better solutions to its customers more efficiently and in more markets. The Company enhanced its ability to make deliveries to the east coast and added a centralized produce distribution solution to its western region. The addition of the produce distribution solution will result in higher quality products while incurring fewer costs related to transportation and waste. The Company eliminated redundancy in its network, while shifting certain operations closer to its customers in an effort to reduce freight miles and provide faster fulfillment. The Company also invested in its labor force, including drivers and warehousemen, fleet, and IT systems in order to provide for further efficiency and execution within the supply chain going forward.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Company was recognized in the current year for its innovation in marketing and merchandising. These efforts have led to the launch of various product and marketing campaigns which have supported the sales trends in the traditional distribution business. At the same time, the Company remains committed to collaboration with independent retailers and launched programs to strengthen these partnerships and to support their success in the retail market. These programs included solutions ranging from e-commerce to customer loyalty and retention programs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Company realized sales growth in its Food Distribution segment, due to incremental distribution volume from both existing and new customer programs, of 4.3% over the prior year. Sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 marked the 12th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth for the segment. The Company remains focused on partnering with independent retailers to support their operations and enhance the consumer experience.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Within the food processing operations, the Company has seen year-over-year progress related to its efforts to improve efficiency and an expansion of its fresh offerings as a result of interest from new types of customers. The Company expects further progress in its profitability as it becomes more experienced at seamlessly onboarding new business opportunities and is able to continue to develop an experienced workforce. The Company also consolidated the produce planning and replenishment processes between food processing and other Food Distribution operations and continues to look for opportunities to drive leverage and synergies through process consolidation and technology.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMilitary\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Military segment continued to support DeCA in the expansion of its private brand program, which has contributed to overall sales growth in 2018. In connection with the overall arrangement, the Company leveraged its private brand capabilities and expertise to help design and develop both DeCA's proprietary and commissary-specific private brands. As of December 29, 2018, the Company had launched over 700 SKUs of private brand products in the DeCA system. The Company looks forward to continuing its partnership with DeCA and anticipates 1,000 total SKUs will be active within the program by the end of 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Company was dedicated to their support of military commissaries which were significantly impacted by Hurricane Florence during the third quarter of 2018.

Incremental sales with this customer commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018 which, combined with continued increases in volume from the private brand program, offset the challenges of operating in a commissary environment which continues to experience negative sales trends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRetail\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Company continued to make strategic Retail segment investments through the execution of five store remodels during 2018. These investments have supported the Company's objectives related to brand repositioning and it expects that they will help improve customer satisfaction and contribute to the achievement of sequential growth in fiscal 2019 comparable store sales. The Company also continued its store rationalization program, and in connection with overall business strategies, closed six retail stores in connection with lease expirations and store rationalization plans during the year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Company expanded Fast Lane, its e-commerce solution, which offers online ordering and curbside pick-up service at approximately 65 retail stores, and same day delivery in several geographies as of December 29, 2018. The Company believes Fast Lane is essential to increasing customer satisfaction through quality service and convenience. Additional enhancements were made to Fast Lane in the current year which integrate yes\u201d\u2122 digital coupons into the shopping experience and provide customers with additional savings and rewards. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company also began partnerships with Instacart in several regions to offer customers additional online shopping options. Lastly, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company developed and piloted a new mobile application which allows customers to scan and bag their groceries as they shop helping them to save time and money.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> During 2018, the Company returned $45.9 million to shareholders from share repurchases and dividend payments.

Net cash used by investing activities was $64.2 million in 2018 compared to $315.4 million in 2017. Net long-term debt decreased $54.8 million compared to the prior year as the Company continues to work towards paying down debt.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company partnered with a third-party advisory firm to commence a company-wide initiative, Project One Team, designed to transform its culture and empower associates at all levels to drive substantial ongoing, sustainable improvements to business processes and results. Project One Team is designed to align with the Company's strategic objectives and is intended to position the Company to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency with benefits in the next one to two years.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> During 2018, the Company remained committed to undertaking business development initiatives within both core and adjacent spaces to further its strategic objectives. In line with this strategy, the Company acquired Martin's Super Markets ( Martin's\u201d) in early 2019. Martin's is a leading Midwest independent supermarket chain which operates 21 stores in the northern Indiana and southwestern Michigan markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe accomplishments above helped position the Company for future earnings growth, but the competitive landscape and industry trends also present challenges to the Company and potential changes in trends that could impact 2019. For fiscal 2019, the Company anticipates year-over-year sales growth to continue in the Food Distribution segment driven primarily by incremental sales to existing customers and new food processing customers. Incremental business with an existing customer and contributions from the ongoing expansion of the DeCA private brand program should continue to drive sales growth in the Military segment. The Company expects sequential improvement in its Retail stores' comparable sales trend, benefiting from current year and future store remodels and the Company's brand repositioning. The Company plans to mitigate these challenges by sustaining sales growth in the Food Distribution segment, aggressively pursuing new business made available by disruption in the industry and driving adjusted operating earnings and adjusted EBITDA growth over the prior year. Additionally, the Company plans to strengthen its management team and improve supply chain capabilities, from identifying and capitalizing on freight efficiencies, to managing through tight labor markets in certain geographies, while increasing the acceptance of private brand products. The Company also plans to deliver value through the execution on Project One Team. The Company will reduce its debt levels and financial leverage ratios to facilitate achieving our strategic objectives. The Company continues to take actions that it believes will enhance the convenience and value that it provides its customers and continues to see positive results from these investments.\nResults of

in 2018 from $7.96 billion in 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to organic growth in the Food Distribution segment and new business in the Military segment, which more than offset lower sales in the Retail segment and lower comparable sales at DeCA operated locations in the Military segment.\nFood Distribution net sales, after intercompany eliminations, increased $163.5 million, or 4.3%, to $3.99 billion in 2018 from $3.83 billion in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to sales growth from new and ongoing programs with existing customers.\nMilitary net sales increased $22.8 million, or 1.1%, to $2.17 billion in 2018 from $2.14 billion in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to new commissary business in the Southwest, incremental volume from the private brand program and a new program with an existing customer, partially offset by lower comparable sales at the DeCA operated locations.\nRetail net sales decreased $85.6 million, or 4.3%, to $1.91 billion in 2018 from $1.99 billion in the prior year. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to lower sales resulting from the closures and sales of retail stores and fuel centers of $64.0 million, as well as negative comparable store sales, partly offset by an increase in fuel prices. Comparable store sales, excluding fuel, were negative 2.0% in the current year and reflect continued strong competition within the industry. The Company defines a retail store as comparable when it is in operation for 14 accounting periods (a period equals four weeks), regardless of remodels, expansions, or relocated stores. The Company's definition of comparable store sales may differ from similarly titled measures at other companies.\nGross Profit - Gross profit represents net sales less cost of sales, which is described in further detail within Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Gross profit decreased $34.5 million, or 3.0%, to $1.11 billion in 2018 compared to $1.14 billion in the prior year. As a percent of net sales, gross profit decreased from 14.4% to 13.8% due to several factors, most notably the increased mix of Food Distribution and Military segment sales as a percentage of total sales combined with a change in customer mix within the Food Distribution segment and higher fees paid to pharmacy benefit managers in the Retail segment. The rate was also impacted by operational issues at one of the Company's distribution centers, serving both the military and food distribution segments, the voluntary product recall on certain fresh cut products and an increase in LIFO expense due to higher inflation.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses - Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages, employee benefits, warehousing costs, store occupancy costs, shipping and handling, utilities, equipment rental, depreciation (to the extent not included in Cost of Sales), out-bound freight and other administrative expenses. SG&A expenses decreased $17.6 million, or 1.7%, to $997.4 million in 2018 from $1,015.0 million in the prior year. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased from 12.7% to 12.4% due to the mix of business operations and decreased administrative costs, partially offset by the impact of increased transportation costs within the Military and Food Distribution segments.\nMerger/Acquisition and Integration Expenses - In 2018, $4.9 million of merger/acquisition and integration expenses were incurred mainly associated with ongoing merger activities from prior years as well as costs associated with the Martin's acquisition. Prior year results included $8.1 million of merger/acquisition and integration expenses primarily associated with the Caito and BRT acquisition, and to a lesser extent, other acquisition-related and ongoing merger activities related to the Nash-Finch merger.\nRestructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Charges, Including Goodwill Impairment - In 2018, $37.5 million of net restructuring, asset impairment and other charges were incurred, predominantly associated with a non-cash charge related to the collectability of a customer advance to an independent retailer of $32.0 million as well as charges incurred as part of the Company's retail store rationalization plans, partially offset by changes in estimates of closed store liabilities and gains on sales of real estate. Prior year results included $228.5 million of restructuring, asset impairment and other charges that consisted primarily of non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $189.0 million related to the Retail segment and $39.4 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges primarily associated with the underlying performance of Company's retail store base and the execution of its store rationalization program.\nOperating Earnings (Loss)\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change in\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food Distribution\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34,363\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Military\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,322\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (196,759\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 212,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating earnings (loss)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (106,675\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 177,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company reported operating earnings of $70.5 million in 2018 compared to an operating loss of $106.7 million in the prior year. The increase of $177.2 million was primarily attributable to prior year non-cash goodwill and asset impairment charges, predominantly related to the Retail segment. The increase was also attributable to higher sales volumes and lower administrative costs, partially offset by the charge associated with the customer advance, a decrease in gross profit rates, and increases in warehousing and transportation costs.\nFood Distribution operating earnings decreased $34.4 million, or 41.3%, to $48.8 million in 2018 from $83.1 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily attributable to the charge on the customer advance, the voluntary product recall, higher transportation costs associated with the roll-out of a significant new customer program and higher LIFO expense, partially offset by higher sales volume and lower healthcare and administrative costs.\nMilitary operating earnings decreased $1.3 million, or 18.9%, to $5.6 million in 2018 from $7.0 million in the prior year. The decrease was attributable to higher transportation costs, operational issues at one distribution center and higher LIFO expense, partially offset by lower administrative costs, lower integration costs, higher sales volume and the gain on the sale of real estate.\nRetail operating earnings increased $212.9 million to $16.1 million in 2018 compared to an operating loss of $196.8 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to goodwill and asset impairment charges in the prior year. Other significant factors include lower health care and other benefits and the closure of underperforming stores, partially offset by lower comparable store sales, higher fees paid to pharmacy benefit managers, as well as acquisition and integration expenses related to the Martin's acquisition.\nInterest Expense - Interest expense increased $5.1 million, or 20.3%, to $30.5 million in 2018 from $25.3 million in the prior year primarily due to an increase in interest rates compared to the prior year.\nIncome Taxes - The Company's effective income tax rates were 17.0% and 60.0% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Differences from the federal statutory rate in the current year are primarily due to the lapse of the statute of limitations for an uncertain tax position and tax credits, partially offset by tax expense related to stock-based compensation and state income taxes. Differences from the federal statutory rate in the prior year were primarily due to the re-measurement of deferred taxes, state taxes, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and charitable product donations. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company re-measured its deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect a change in the federal statutory rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), enacted on December 22, 2017. As a result, the Company realized an income tax benefit of $26.0 million related to 2017.

The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to contributions from the Caito acquisition, organic growth of 4.1% in the Food Distribution segment, new military commissary business in the Southwest in the second half of the year and increased contributions from the DeCA private brand program, partly offset by lower comparable sales at DeCA operated locations and lower sales in the Retail segment resulting from the closure and sale of retail stores and a decrease in comparable store sales.\nFood Distribution net sales, after intercompany eliminations, increased $546.9 million, or 16.7%, to $3.83 billion in 2017 from $3.28 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to contributions from the Caito acquisition and organic growth of 3.7% related to incremental sales volume to existing customers.\nMilitary net sales decreased $53.0 million, or 2.4%, to $2.14 billion in 2017 from $2.20 billion in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales at the DeCA operated locations, partially offset by new business in the Southwest and contributions from the DeCA private brand program.\nRetail net sales decreased $91.2 million, or 4.4%, to $1.99 billion in 2017 from $2.08 billion in 2016. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to $60.8 million of lower sales resulting from the closures and sales of retail stores as well as negative comparable store sales, partially offset by the impact of higher fuel prices. Comparable store sales for the year, excluding fuel, were negative 2.4%.\nGross Profit - Gross profit increased $33.4 million, or 3.0%, to $1.14 billion in 2017 compared to $1.11 billion in 2016. As a percent of net sales, gross profit decreased from 14.7% to 14.4% due to several factors, most notably the increased mix of Food Distribution sales as a percentage of total sales. The rate was also impacted by margin investments at both Retail and Food Distribution, the cycling of a significant 2016 LIFO benefit and lower fuel margins, partially offset by higher margin rates in the Military segment.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses - SG&A expenses increased $51.8 million, or 5.4%, to $1,015.0 million in 2017 from $963.2 million in 2016, representing 12.7% of net sales in both years. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily attributable to higher operational expenses related to the Caito acquisition, increased healthcare costs and higher transportation and occupancy costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation and other cost savings.\nMerger/Acquisition and Integration Expenses - In 2017, $8.1 million of merger/acquisition and integration expenses were incurred mainly associated with the Caito and BRT acquisition, and to a lesser extent, other acquisition-related and ongoing merger activities. The Company's 2016 results included $7.0 million of merger/acquisition and integration expenses primarily associated with the Nash-Finch merger, particularly system upgrades and implementations, as well as costs incurred in connection with 2016 and 2015 acquisitions.\nRestructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Charges, Including Goodwill Impairment - In 2017, $228.5 million of net restructuring, asset impairment and other charges were incurred, predominantly associated with goodwill and asset impairment charges. The Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $189.0 million related to the Retail segment. The impairment was driven by significantly lower than expected Retail operating results due to an increasingly competitive retail environment and the related pricing pressures that are anticipated to negatively impact gross margin, operating profit, and future cash flows. The Company also recorded $39.4 million of restructuring and asset impairment and restructuring charges primarily associated with the underlying performance of Company's retail store base and the execution of its store rationalization program. The Company's 2016 results included $32.1 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges that consisted primarily of impairment charges related to four underperforming retail stores and restructuring charges primarily related to three retail stores and two food distribution centers. The facilities were closed as part of the Company's retail store and warehouse rationalization plan.\nOperating (Loss) Earnings\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change in\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food Distribution\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,181\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Military\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,247\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (196,759\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (208,431\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating (loss) earnings\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (106,675\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (215,859\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company reported an operating loss of $106.7 million in 2017 compared to operating earnings of $109.2 million in 2016. The decrease of $215.9 million was primarily attributable to 2017 non-cash goodwill and restructuring and asset impairment charges of $228.5 million, predominantly related to the Retail segment, higher costs associated with Caito operations and Fresh Kitchen start-up activities, as well as increased LIFO and health care expenses, partly offset by lower incentive compensation expense and various cost savings initiatives.\nFood Distribution operating earnings decreased $2.2 million, or 2.6%, to $83.1 million in 2017 from $85.3 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to Caito operations and Fresh Kitchen start-up activities and higher LIFO expense, partially offset by net sales growth from new and existing customers, lower incentive compensation and lower operating expenses associated with various cost savings initiatives.\nMilitary operating earnings decreased $5.3 million, or 43.0%, to $7.0 million in 2017 from $12.2 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales at the DeCA-operated commissaries, higher supply chain costs associated with industry-wide transportation cost challenges, onboarding and ramping up new and high-growth lines of business and increased healthcare and LIFO expense, partially offset by growth from the new military commissary business in the Southwest and the DeCA private brand program, as well as lower incentive compensation and margin improvements.\nRetail reported an operating loss of ($196.8) million in 2017 compared to operating earnings of $11.7 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to goodwill and higher asset impairment charges, lower comparable store sales, investments in margin and store labor, and higher occupancy and healthcare costs, partly offset by lower costs related to incentive compensation, depreciation, merger/acquisition and integration and closed stores.\nInterest Expense - Interest expense increased $6.2 million, or 32.8%, to $25.3 million in 2017 from $19.1 million in 2016 primarily due to increased borrowings related to the Caito and BRT acquisition and the timing of working capital requirements.\nDebt Extinguishment - A loss on debt extinguishment of $0.4 million was incurred in 2017 in connection with the pay down of the term loan component of the senior secured credit facility. A loss on debt extinguishment of $0.2 million was incurred in 2016 in connection with the amendment of the senior secured credit facility.\nIncome Taxes - The Company's effective income tax rates were 60.0% and 36.6% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Differences from the federal statutory rate are primarily due to the re-measurement of deferred taxes mentioned previously, state taxes, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and charitable product donations in the current year and state taxes in 2016.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company also provides information regarding adjusted operating earnings, adjusted earnings from continuing operations, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( adjusted EBITDA\u201d). These are non-GAAP financial measures, as defined below, and are used by management to allocate resources, assess performance against its peers and evaluate overall performance. The Company believes these measures provide useful information for both management and its investors. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide additional understanding of the trends and special circumstances that affect its business. These measures provide useful supplemental information that helps investors to establish a basis for expected performance and the ability to evaluate actual results against that expectation. The measures, when considered in connection with GAAP results, can be used to assess the overall performance of the Company as well as assess the Company's performance against its peers. These measures are also used as a basis for certain compensation programs sponsored by the Company. In addition, securities analysts, fund managers and other shareholders and stakeholders that communicate with the Company request its financial results in these adjusted formats.\nCurrent year adjusted operating earnings, adjusted earnings from continuing operations, and adjusted EBITDA exclude start-up costs associated with the new Fresh Kitchen operation through the start-up period, which concluded during the first quarter. The Fresh Kitchen is a newly constructed facility that provides the Company with the ability to process, cook, and package fresh protein-based foods and complete meal solutions. Given the Fresh Kitchen represents a new line of business for the Company, the start-up activities associated with testing, training, and preparing the Fresh Kitchen for production, as well as incorporating the related operations into the business, are considered non-operational\u201d or non-core\u201d in nature. The 2017 retirement stock compensation award represents incremental compensation expense in connection with an executive retirement that is also considered non-operational\u201d or non-core\u201d in nature.\nAdjusted Operating Earnings\nAdjusted operating earnings is a non-GAAP operating financial measure that the Company defines as operating earnings plus or minus adjustments for items that do not reflect the ongoing operating activities of the Company and costs associated with the closing of operational locations.\nThe Company believes that adjusted operating earnings provide a meaningful representation of its operating performance for the Company as a whole and for its operating segments. The Company considers adjusted operating earnings as an additional way to measure operating performance on an ongoing basis. Adjusted operating earnings is meant to reflect the ongoing operating performance of all of its distribution and retail operations; consequently, it excludes the impact of items that could be considered non-operating\u201d or non-core\u201d in nature, and also excludes the contributions of activities classified as discontinued operations. Because adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings by segment are performance measures that management uses to allocate resources, assess performance against its peers and evaluate overall performance, the Company believes it provides useful information for both management and its investors. In addition, securities analysts, fund managers and other shareholders and stakeholders that communicate with the Company request its operating financial results in an adjusted operating earnings format.\nAdjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings by segment are not measures of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and should not be considered as a substitute for operating earnings, cash flows from operating activities and other income or cash flow statement data. The Company's definitions of adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings by segment may not be identical to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of operating earnings (loss) to adjusted operating earnings for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

measure that the Company defines as earnings from continuing operations plus or minus adjustments for items that do not reflect the ongoing operating activities of the Company and costs associated with the closing of operational locations.\nThe Company believes that adjusted earnings from continuing operations provide a meaningful representation of its operating performance for the Company. The Company considers adjusted earnings from continuing operations as an additional way to measure operating performance on an ongoing basis. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations is meant to reflect the ongoing operating performance of all of its distribution and retail operations; consequently, it excludes the impact of items that could be considered non-operating\u201d or non-core\u201d in nature, and also excludes the contributions of activities classified as discontinued operations. Because adjusted earnings from continuing operations is a performance measure that management uses to allocate resources, assess performance against its peers and evaluate overall performance, the Company believes it provides useful information for both management and its investors. In addition, securities analysts, fund managers and other shareholders and stakeholders that communicate with the Company request its operating financial results in adjusted earnings from continuing operations format.\nAdjusted earnings from continuing operations is not a measure of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should not be considered as a substitute for net earnings, cash flows from operating activities and other income or cash flow statement data. The Company's definition of adjusted earnings from continuing operations may not be identical to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of earnings

Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, assets held for sale, long-lived assets, income taxes, self-insurance reserves, restructuring costs, retirement benefits, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. Based on the Company's ongoing review, the Company makes adjustments it considers appropriate under the facts and circumstances. This discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company believes these accounting policies and others set forth in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The Company has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nAn accounting policy is considered critical if: a) it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and b) different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company considers the following accounting policies to represent the more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with approximately 88.9% of the Company's inventories valued using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO\u201d) method. The remaining inventories are valued on the first-in, first-out ( FIFO\u201d) method. The Company accounts for its Food Distribution and Military inventory using a perpetual system and utilizes the retail inventory method ( RIM\u201d) to value inventory for center store products in the Retail segment. Under the RIM, inventory is stated at cost with cost of sales and gross margin calculated by applying a cost ratio to the retail value of inventories. RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry. Inherent in the RIM calculations are certain significant management judgments and estimates, including inventory shortages and cost-to-retail ratios, which impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the resulting gross profit. Management consistently applies its RIM valuations by product category and believes that the Company's RIM provides an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost.\nFresh, pharmacy and fuel products are accounted for at cost in the Retail segment. The Company evaluates inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in its facilities. The Company records allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing inventories, including those used in past calculations, are reviewed and applied consistently, and as a result, the Company believes the estimates and assumptions are both reasonable and accurate. The Company does not anticipate future changes to the estimates or assumptions used in valuing inventories, but it does anticipate that inflation and/or deflation will continue to have a significant impact on the Company's LIFO reserve as price changes represent a significant driver of the calculation.\nVendor Funds, Allowances and Credits\nThe Company receives funds from many of its vendors when purchasing products to sell to its corporate owned retail stores and independent retailers. Given the highly promotional nature of the retail supermarket industry, vendor allowances are generally intended to help defray the costs of promotion, advertising and selling the vendor's products. Vendor allowances that relate to the Company's buying and merchandising activities consist primarily of promotional allowances, which are generally allowances on purchased quantities and, to a lesser extent, slotting allowances, which are billed to vendors for the Company's merchandising costs such as setting up warehouse infrastructure. The proper recognition and timing of accounting for these items are significant to the reporting of the results of the Company's operations. Vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold. Lump sum payments received for multi-year contracts are amortized over the life of the contracts based on contractual terms. The amount and timing of recognition of vendor funds as well as the amount of vendor funds to be recognized as a reduction to ending inventory requires management judgment and estimates. Management determines these amounts based on estimates of current year purchase volume using forecast and historical data and review of average inventory turnover data. These judgments and estimates impact the Company's reported gross profit, operating earnings (loss) and inventory amounts. The Company believes its historical estimates and use of this methodology have been reliable in the past and will continue to be reliable in the future.\nCustomer Exposure and Credit Risk\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors. In most circumstances when the Company becomes aware of factors that may indicate a deterioration in a specific customer's ability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., reductions of product purchases, deteriorating store conditions, changes in payment patterns), the Company records a specific reserve to reduce the receivable to an amount the Company reasonably believes will be collected. In determining the adequacy of the reserves, the Company analyzes factors such as the value of any collateral, customer financial statements, historical collection experience, aging of receivables and other economic and industry factors. It is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the collectability based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts. If circumstances change (e.g., further evidence of material adverse creditworthiness, additional accounts become credit risks, store closures), the Company's estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount, including to zero.\nFunds Advanced to Independent Retailers. From time to time, the Company may advance funds to independent retailers which are earned by the retailers primarily through achieving specified purchase volume requirements, as outlined in their supply agreements with the Company, or in limited instances, for remaining a SpartanNash customer for a specified time period. These advances must be repaid if the purchase volume requirements are not met or if the retailer does not remain a customer for the specified time period. In the event these retailers are unable to repay these advances or otherwise experience an event of default, the Company may be unable to recover the unearned portion of the funds advanced to these independent retailers. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these advances based on a number of factors, including anticipated and historical purchase volume, the value of any collateral, customer financial statements and other economic and industry factors, and establishes a reserve for the advances as necessary. As of December 29, 2018, the Company has unearned advanced funds of approximately $85.3 million, and has established a reserve of $35.1 million for these advances.\nGuarantees of Debt and Lease Obligations of Others. The Company may guarantee debt and lease obligations of independent retailers. In the event these retailers are unable to meet their debt service payments or otherwise experience an event of default, the Company would be unconditionally liable for the outstanding balance of their debt and lease obligations, which would be due in accordance with the underlying agreements.\nThe Company has guaranteed the outstanding lease obligations of certain independent retailers. These guarantees, which are secured by certain business assets and personal guarantees of the respective independent retailers, represent the maximum undiscounted payments the Company would be required to make in the event of default. The Company believes these independent retailers will be able to perform under the lease agreements and that no payments will be required, and no loss will be incurred under the guarantees. A liability representing the fair value of the obligations assumed under the guarantees is included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company also subleases and assigns various leases to third parties. In circumstances when the Company becomes aware of factors that indicate deterioration in a third party's ability to meet its financial obligations guaranteed or assigned by SpartanNash, the Company records a specific reserve in the amount the Company reasonably believes it will be obligated to pay on the third party's behalf, net of any anticipated recoveries from the third party. In determining the adequacy of these reserves, the Company analyzes factors such as those described above in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - Methodology\u201d and Lease Commitments.\u201d It is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the obligations based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts, with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on operating results and cash flows. Triggering these guarantees or obligations under assigned leases would not, however, result in cross default of the Company's debt, but could restrict resources available for general business initiatives. Refer to Note 15, Concentration of Credit Risk, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding customer exposure and credit risk.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with any excess purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired being recorded as goodwill.\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by the Company but are inherently uncertain. Also, determining the estimated useful life of an intangible asset requires judgment based on the Company's expected use of the asset, as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. The Company typically utilizes the income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which discounts the projected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuation reflect a consideration of other marketplace competition and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability) and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis (during the last quarter of the year), or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company has three reporting units, which are the same as the Company's reportable segments; however, there is no goodwill recorded within the Retail or Military segments. Fair values are determined based on the discounted cash flows and comparable market values of each reporting segment. If a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company's goodwill impairment analysis also includes a comparison of the aggregate estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the Company's total market capitalization. Therefore, a significant and sustained decline in the Company's stock price could result in goodwill impairment charges. During times of financial market volatility, significant judgment is given to determine the underlying cause of the decline and whether stock price declines are short-term in nature or indicative of an event or change in circumstances.\nDetermining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires that the Company make significant estimates and assumptions, including long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate discount rates. The Company's judgments are based on the perspective of a market participant, historical experience, current market trends and other information. In estimating future cash flows, the Company utilizes internally generated three-year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures, and a long-term assumed growth rate of cash flows for periods after the three-year forecast. The future estimated cash flows are discounted based upon the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which was 11.9% for the Food Distribution reporting unit. The determination of the weighted average cost of capital incorporates current interest rates, equity risk premiums, and other market-based expectations regarding expected investment returns. The Company generally develops its forecasts based on recent sales data for existing operations and other factors. While the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different assumptions could result in different outcomes.\nAs of the date of the most recent goodwill impairment test, which utilized data and assumptions as of October 6, 2018, the Food Distribution reporting unit had a fair value that was in excess of its carrying value. The Company has sufficient available information, both current and historical, to support its assumptions, judgments and estimates used in the goodwill impairment test; however, if actual results for the Food Distribution segment are not consistent with the Company's estimates, it could result in the Company recording a non-cash impairment charge.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Other Than Goodwill\nLong-lived assets to be held and used are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When the undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to recover an asset's carrying amount, the fair value is compared to the carrying value to determine the impairment loss to be recorded. Long-lived assets are evaluated at the asset-group level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Impairments of long-lived assets were $2.6 million, $33.7 million and $15.6 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nEstimates of future cash flows and expected sales prices are judgments based upon the Company's experience and knowledge of operations. These estimates project cash flows several years into the future and are affected by changes in the economy, the competitive environment, real estate market conditions and inflation.\nLong-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. Management determines fair values using independent appraisals, quotes or expected sales prices developed by internal real estate professionals. Estimates of expected sales prices are judgments based upon the Company's experience, knowledge of market conditions and current offers received. Changes in market conditions, the economic environment and other factors, including the Company's ability to effectively compete and react to competitor openings, can significantly impact these estimates. While the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different assumptions could result in a different outcome.\nReserves for Closed Properties\nThe Company records reserves for closed properties that are subject to long-term lease commitments based upon the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term, net of estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably expected to be obtained for the property. Future cash flows are based on contractual lease terms and knowledge of the geographic area in which the closed site is located. These estimates are subject to multiple factors, including inflation, ability to sublease the property and other economic conditions. Internally developed estimates of sublease rentals are based upon the geographic areas in which the properties are located, the results of previous efforts to sublease similar properties, and the current economic environment. Reserves may be adjusted in the future based upon the actual resolution of each of these factors At December 29, 2018, reserves for closed properties for distribution center and store lease and ancillary costs total $16.4 million. Based upon the current economic environment, the Company does not believe that it is likely to obtain any sublease rentals. A 5% increase/decrease in future estimated ancillary costs would result in a $0.4 million increase/decrease in the restructuring charge liability.\nInsurance Reserves\nSpartanNash is self-insured through self-insurance retentions or high deductible programs for workers' compensation, general liability, and automobile liability, and is also self-insured for healthcare costs. Self-insurance liabilities are recorded based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Workers' compensation, general liability and automobile liabilities are actuarially estimated based on available historical information on an undiscounted basis. The Company has purchased stop-loss coverage to limit its exposure on a per claim basis for its self-insurance retentions and high deductible programs. On a per claim basis, the Company's exposure is up to $0.5 million for workers' compensation and general liability, $1.0 million for automobile liability, and $0.5 million for healthcare per covered life per year. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to self-insurance reserves.\nAny projection of losses concerning insurance reserves is subject to a degree of variability. Among the causes of variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, discount rates, litigation trends, changing regulations, legal interpretations, benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns. Although the Company's estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, such changes could have a material impact on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities. The impact of many of these variables may be difficult to estimate.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nAccounting for defined benefit plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based on vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the time period each associate works. The significant factors affecting the Company's pension costs are the fair values of plan assets and the selections of management's key assumptions, including the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used by the Company's actuary to calculate its liability. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in interest rates and investment returns, in selecting these assumptions. The discount rate is based on current investment yields on high quality fixed-income investments and projected cash flow obligations. Expected return on plan assets is based on projected returns by asset class on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices, as well as the Company's target asset allocation, which is designed to meet the Company's long-term pension requirements. While the Company believes the assumptions selected are reasonable, significant differences in its actual experience, plan amendments or significant changes in the fair value of its plan assets may materially affect its pension obligations and its future expense.\nSensitivities to changes in the major assumptions for the SpartanNash Company Pension Plan and the SpartanNash Company Retiree Medical Plan as of December 29, 2018, are as follows:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Projected\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease / (Increase)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease / (Increase)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected return on plan assets - SpartanNash Company Pension Plan\n</td> <td> +/- 0.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $0.3 / $(0.3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate - SpartanNash Company Pension Plan\n</td> <td> +/- 0.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $3.2 / $(3.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate - SpartanNash Company Retiree Medical Plan\n</td> <td> +/- 0.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $0.7 / $(0.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer to Note 11, Associate Retirement Plans, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the assumptions used to estimate the cost of benefits and for details related to changes in the funded status of the defined benefit pension plans.\nIncome Taxes\nSpartanNash is subject to periodic audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other state and local taxing authorities. These audits may challenge certain of the Company's tax positions, such as the timing and amount of income credits and deductions and the allocation of taxable income to various tax jurisdictions. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. These tax uncertainties are reviewed as facts and circumstances change and are adjusted accordingly. This requires significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the Company's effective income tax rate and cash flows in future years. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which it expects the differences to reverse. Refer to Note 13, Income Tax, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flow Information\nThe following table summarizes the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows for 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flow activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 171,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 157,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64,156\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (315,393\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (68,227\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (104,300\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 254,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (86,594\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (284\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (137\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (738\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,684\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at end of year\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased for 2018 compared to 2017 by approximately $118.8 million primarily due to lower working capital requirements, particularly inventory and accounts receivable, compared to the prior year.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased for 2017 versus 2016 by approximately $104.3 million. The change was primarily due to the timing of working capital requirements, particularly higher accounts receivable and inventory balances associated with new distribution business and incremental sales to certain high-growth distribution customers. The timing of year-end payments impacting accounts payable balances also contributed to the change in cash flows, which was partly offset by lower customer advances compared to the 2016.\nDuring 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company made $0.1 million, $10.7 million and $35.8 million, respectively, in net income tax payments.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $251.2 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the Caito and BRT acquisition made in the prior year.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $247.2 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the Caito and BRT acquisition made in 2017\nThe Food Distribution, Military and Retail segments utilized 46.6%, 4.9% and 48.5% of capital expenditures, respectively, for 2018. Expenditures for 2018 primarily related to retail store remodels and upgrades, which include five store remodels, various equipment purchases, and IT system upgrades and implementations to better streamline processes and meet the operational and supply chain needs of the Company. The Company expects capital expenditures to range from $85.0 million to $93.0 million for 2019.\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities increased $358.3 million during 2018 over 2017 primarily due to borrowings on the revolving credit facility in the prior year to fund the acquisition and working capital, as well as increases in cash provided by operating activities which were used to pay down debt in the current year.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $340.6 million during 2017 over 2016 primarily due to borrowings on the revolving credit facility to fund the Caito and BRT acquisition and timing of working capital requirements, partially offset by a $26.0 million increase in cash used for the repurchase of common stock.\nNet cash used in discontinued operations. Net cash used in discontinued operations contains the net cash flows of the Company's Food Distribution and Retail discontinued operations and is primarily composed of facility maintenance expenditures.\nDebt Management\nTotal debt, including capital lease obligations and current maturities, decreased $51.9 million to $698.1 million as of December 29, 2018 from $750.0 million at December 30, 2017. The decrease in total debt was driven by principal payments in the current year due to an increase in cash provided by operations.\nIn December 2018, SpartanNash Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to the Company's Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The principal changes of the amendment included an extension of the maturity date of the loans from December 20, 2021 to December 18, 2023, the ability to increase the size of the Tranche A revolving loan to $975 million from $900 million, an amendment to the interest rate grid such that rates for the Tranche A-1 revolving loans are now LIBOR plus 2.25% to LIBOR plus 2.50%, a reload of the $60 million Tranche A-2 term loan and a reset of certain advance rates for the borrowing base. The Credit Agreement provides for borrowings of $1.1 billion, consisting of three tranches: a $975 million secured revolving credit facility (Tranche A), a $40 million secured revolving credit facility (Tranche A-1), and a $60 million term loan (Tranche A-2). The Company has the ability to increase the size of the Credit Agreement by an additional $325 million, subject to certain conditions in the Credit Agreement. The Company's obligations under the related Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company's personal and real property. The Company may repay all loans in whole or in part at any time without penalty.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and its senior secured credit facility. As of December 29, 2018, the senior secured credit facility had outstanding borrowings of $660.9 million. Additional available borrowings under the Company's $1.1 billion Credit Agreement are based on stipulated advance rates on eligible assets, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintains Excess Availability of 10% of the borrowing base, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company had excess availability after the 10% requirement of $262.0 million at December 29, 2018. Payment of dividends and repurchases of outstanding shares are permitted, provided that certain levels of excess availability are maintained. The credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit, of which $11.7 million were outstanding as of December 29, 2018. The revolving credit facility matures December 18, 2023 and is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets. The Company believes that cash generated from operating activities and available borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, and debt service obligations for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that the business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that the Company will maintain its ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Company's current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) was 2.10:1 at December 29, 2018 compared to 2.03:1 at December 30, 2017, and its investment in working capital was $524.6 million at December 29, 2018 compared to $509.7 million at December 30, 2017. Net debt to total capital ratio decreased to 0.49:1 at December 29, 2018 from 0.50:1 at December 30, 2017. Total net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as long-term debt and capital lease obligations, plus current maturities of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, less cash and cash equivalents. The Company believes both management and its investors find the information useful because it reflects the amount of long-term debt obligations that are not covered by available cash and temporary investments. Total net debt is not a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may differ from similarly titled measures of other companies.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of long-term debt and capital lease obligations to total net long-term debt and capital lease obligations as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017.\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is generally permitted to pay dividends in any year up to an amount such that all cash dividends, together with any cash distributions and share repurchases, do not exceed $35.0 million. Additionally, the Company is generally permitted to pay cash dividends in excess of $35.0 million in any year so long as its Excess Availability, as defined in the Credit Agreement, is in excess of 10% of the Total Borrowing Base, as defined in the Credit Agreement, before and after giving effect to the repurchases and dividends. Although the Company currently expects to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend, adoption of a dividend policy does not commit the Board of Directors (the Board\u201d) to declare future dividends. Each future dividend will be considered and declared by the Board at its discretion. Whether the Board continues to declare dividends depends on a number of factors, including the Company's future financial condition, anticipated profitability and cash flows and compliance with the terms of its credit facilities.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to recently adopted accounting standards, as well as the anticipated effect of any impending accounting standards.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAbout SpartanNash\nSpartanNash, headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is a leading multi-regional grocery distributor and grocery retailer whose core businesses include distributing grocery products to a diverse group of independent and chain retailers, its corporate owned retail stores, and military commissaries and exchanges in the United States. The Company operates three reportable business segments: Food Distribution, Military and Retail.\nThe Company's Food Distribution segment provides a wide variety of nationally branded and private brand grocery products and perishable food products to approximately 2,100 independent retailers, the Company's corporate owned retail stores, food service distributors and various other customers. Through its Food Distribution segment, the Company also services national retailers, including Dollar General. Sales to Dollar General are made to more than 15,500 of its retail locations. Combined with the Military segment, the Company currently services customers in all 50 states. The Company processes fresh-cut fruits and vegetables and other value-added meal solutions and supplies these products to grocery retailers and food service distributors. Through the Fresh Kitchen facility, the Company processes, cooks and packages fresh protein-based foods and complete meal solutions for a number of different customers.\nThe Company's Military segment contracts with manufacturers to distribute a wide variety of grocery products, including dry groceries, beverages, meat, and frozen foods, primarily to military commissaries and exchanges located in the United States, the District of Columbia, Europe, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Bahrain, Djibouti and Egypt. The Company is also the DeCA exclusive worldwide supplier of private brand grocery and related products to U.S. military commissaries. The Company has over 40 years of experience acting as a distributor to U.S. military commissaries and exchanges.\nThe Company's Retail segment operated 139 corporate owned retail stores in the Midwest region primarily under the banners of Family Fare Supermarkets, D&W Fresh Markets, VG's Grocery, Dan's Supermarket and Family Fresh Market as of December 29, 2018. The Company also offered pharmacy services in 82 of its corporate owned stores (of which 72 pharmacies are owned) and operated 29 fuel centers. The retail stores have a neighborhood market\u201d strategy that focuses on value beyond price, affordable wellness, and commitment to local products.\nThe Company's fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to December 31. The following discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ending or ended December 28, 2019 ( 2019\u201d), December 29, 2018 (\"2018\" or current year\u201d), December 30, 2017 ( 2017\u201d or prior year\u201d) and December 31, 2016 ( 2016\u201d), all of which include 52 weeks. All fiscal quarters are 12 weeks, except for the Company's first quarter, which is 16 weeks and will generally include the Easter holiday. The fourth quarter includes the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, and depending on the fiscal year end, may include the New Year's holiday.\nIn certain geographic areas, the Company's sales and operating performance may vary with seasonality. Many stores are dependent on tourism, and therefore, are most affected by seasons and weather patterns, including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of snowfall during the winter months and the range of temperature during the summer months.\nOverview of 2018\nIn 2018, the Company executed against its long-term strategic objective of becoming a growth company that is focused on developing a national, highly efficient distribution platform known for solving unique and complex logistical issues and evolving its primary retail brand to deliver innovative solutions, both of which service a diverse customer base. The Company also began a company-wide initiative late in the fourth quarter to drive sustainable profit improvements.\nThe Company's 2018 accomplishments and developments include:\nFood Distribution\n \u2022 During 2018, the Company expanded its supply chain capabilities to provide better solutions to its customers more efficiently and in more markets. The Company enhanced its ability to make deliveries to the east coast and added a centralized produce distribution solution to its western region. The addition of the produce distribution solution will result in higher quality products while incurring fewer costs related to transportation and waste. The Company eliminated redundancy in its network, while shifting certain operations closer to its customers in an effort to reduce freight miles and provide faster fulfillment. The Company also invested in its labor force, including drivers and warehousemen, fleet, and IT systems in order to provide for further efficiency and execution within the supply chain going forward. \n \u2022 The Company was recognized in the current year for its innovation in marketing and merchandising. These efforts have led to the launch of various product and marketing campaigns which have supported the sales trends in the traditional distribution business. At the same time, the Company remains committed to collaboration with independent retailers and launched programs to strengthen these partnerships and to support their success in the retail market. These programs included solutions ranging from e-commerce to customer loyalty and retention programs. \n \u2022 The Company realized sales growth in its Food Distribution segment, due to incremental distribution volume from both existing and new customer programs, of 4.3% over the prior year. Sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 marked the 12th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth for the segment. The Company remains focused on partnering with independent retailers to support their operations and enhance the consumer experience. \n \u2022 Within the food processing operations, the Company has seen year-over-year progress related to its efforts to improve efficiency and an expansion of its fresh offerings as a result of interest from new types of customers. The Company expects further progress in its profitability as it becomes more experienced at seamlessly onboarding new business opportunities and is able to continue to develop an experienced workforce. The Company also consolidated the produce planning and replenishment processes between food processing and other Food Distribution operations and continues to look for opportunities to drive leverage and synergies through process consolidation and technology. \nMilitary\n \u2022 The Military segment continued to support DeCA in the expansion of its private brand program, which has contributed to overall sales growth in 2018. In connection with the overall arrangement, the Company leveraged its private brand capabilities and expertise to help design and develop both DeCA's proprietary and commissary-specific private brands. As of December 29, 2018, the Company had launched over 700 SKUs of private brand products in the DeCA system. The Company looks forward to continuing its partnership with DeCA and anticipates 1,000 total SKUs will be active within the program by the end of 2019. \n \u2022 The Company was dedicated to their support of military commissaries which were significantly impacted by Hurricane Florence during the third quarter of 2018. The Company responded to urgent requests of DeCA and made additional deliveries of water to these commissaries. \n \u2022 In the third quarter of 2018, the Company secured a significant contract for incremental business with an existing customer through the continued demonstration of superior customer service and execution capabilities. Incremental sales with this customer commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018 which, combined with continued increases in volume from the private brand program, offset the challenges of operating in a commissary environment which continues to experience negative sales trends. \nRetail\n \u2022 The Company continued to make strategic Retail segment investments through the execution of five store remodels during 2018. These investments have supported the Company's objectives related to brand repositioning and it expects that they will help improve customer satisfaction and contribute to the achievement of sequential growth in fiscal 2019 comparable store sales. The Company also continued its store rationalization program, and in connection with overall business strategies, closed six retail stores in connection with lease expirations and store rationalization plans during the year. \n \u2022 The Company expanded Fast Lane, its e-commerce solution, which offers online ordering and curbside pick-up service at approximately 65 retail stores, and same day delivery in several geographies as of December 29, 2018. The Company believes Fast Lane is essential to increasing customer satisfaction through quality service and convenience. Additional enhancements were made to Fast Lane in the current year which integrate yes\u201d\u2122 digital coupons into the shopping experience and provide customers with additional savings and rewards. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company also began partnerships with Instacart in several regions to offer customers additional online shopping options. Lastly, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company developed and piloted a new mobile application which allows customers to scan and bag their groceries as they shop helping them to save time and money. \nOther\n \u2022 During 2018, the Company returned $45.9 million to shareholders from share repurchases and dividend payments. The Company also improved working capital compared to the prior year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $171.7 million in 2018 compared to $52.8 million in 2017. Net cash used by investing activities was $64.2 million in 2018 compared to $315.4 million in 2017. Net long-term debt decreased $54.8 million compared to the prior year as the Company continues to work towards paying down debt. \n \u2022 In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company partnered with a third-party advisory firm to commence a company-wide initiative, Project One Team, designed to transform its culture and empower associates at all levels to drive substantial ongoing, sustainable improvements to business processes and results. Project One Team is designed to align with the Company's strategic objectives and is intended to position the Company to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency with benefits in the next one to two years. \n \u2022 During 2018, the Company remained committed to undertaking business development initiatives within both core and adjacent spaces to further its strategic objectives. In line with this strategy, the Company acquired Martin's Super Markets ( Martin's\u201d) in early 2019. Martin's is a leading Midwest independent supermarket chain which operates 21 stores in the northern Indiana and southwestern Michigan markets. \nThe accomplishments above helped position the Company for future earnings growth, but the competitive landscape and industry trends also present challenges to the Company and potential changes in trends that could impact 2019. For fiscal 2019, the Company anticipates year-over-year sales growth to continue in the Food Distribution segment driven primarily by incremental sales to existing customers and new food processing customers. Incremental business with an existing customer and contributions from the ongoing expansion of the DeCA private brand program should continue to drive sales growth in the Military segment. The Company expects sequential improvement in its Retail stores' comparable sales trend, benefiting from current year and future store remodels and the Company's brand repositioning. The Company plans to mitigate these challenges by sustaining sales growth in the Food Distribution segment, aggressively pursuing new business made available by disruption in the industry and driving adjusted operating earnings and adjusted EBITDA growth over the prior year. Additionally, the Company plans to strengthen its management team and improve supply chain capabilities, from identifying and capitalizing on freight efficiencies, to managing through tight labor markets in certain geographies, while increasing the acceptance of private brand products. The Company also plans to deliver value through the execution on Project One Team. The Company will reduce its debt levels and financial leverage ratios to facilitate achieving our strategic objectives. The Company continues to take actions that it believes will enhance the convenience and value that it provides its customers and continues to see positive results from these investments.\nResults of

in 2018 from $7.96 billion in 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to organic growth in the Food Distribution segment and new business in the Military segment, which more than offset lower sales in the Retail segment and lower comparable sales at DeCA operated locations in the Military segment.\nFood Distribution net sales, after intercompany eliminations, increased $163.5 million, or 4.3%, to $3.99 billion in 2018 from $3.83 billion in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to sales growth from new and ongoing programs with existing customers.\nMilitary net sales increased $22.8 million, or 1.1%, to $2.17 billion in 2018 from $2.14 billion in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to new commissary business in the Southwest, incremental volume from the private brand program and a new program with an existing customer, partially offset by lower comparable sales at the DeCA operated locations.\nRetail net sales decreased $85.6 million, or 4.3%, to $1.91 billion in 2018 from $1.99 billion in the prior year. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to lower sales resulting from the closures and sales of retail stores and fuel centers of $64.0 million, as well as negative comparable store sales, partly offset by an increase in fuel prices. Comparable store sales, excluding fuel, were negative 2.0% in the current year and reflect continued strong competition within the industry. The Company defines a retail store as comparable when it is in operation for 14 accounting periods (a period equals four weeks), regardless of remodels, expansions, or relocated stores. The Company's definition of comparable store sales may differ from similarly titled measures at other companies.\nGross Profit - Gross profit represents net sales less cost of sales, which is described in further detail within Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Gross profit decreased $34.5 million, or 3.0%, to $1.11 billion in 2018 compared to $1.14 billion in the prior year. As a percent of net sales, gross profit decreased from 14.4% to 13.8% due to several factors, most notably the increased mix of Food Distribution and Military segment sales as a percentage of total sales combined with a change in customer mix within the Food Distribution segment and higher fees paid to pharmacy benefit managers in the Retail segment. The rate was also impacted by operational issues at one of the Company's distribution centers, serving both the military and food distribution segments, the voluntary product recall on certain fresh cut products and an increase in LIFO expense due to higher inflation.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses - Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages, employee benefits, warehousing costs, store occupancy costs, shipping and handling, utilities, equipment rental, depreciation (to the extent not included in Cost of Sales), out-bound freight and other administrative expenses. SG&A expenses decreased $17.6 million, or 1.7%, to $997.4 million in 2018 from $1,015.0 million in the prior year. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased from 12.7% to 12.4% due to the mix of business operations and decreased administrative costs, partially offset by the impact of increased transportation costs within the Military and Food Distribution segments.\nMerger/Acquisition and Integration Expenses - In 2018, $4.9 million of merger/acquisition and integration expenses were incurred mainly associated with ongoing merger activities from prior years as well as costs associated with the Martin's acquisition. Prior year results included $8.1 million of merger/acquisition and integration expenses primarily associated with the Caito and BRT acquisition, and to a lesser extent, other acquisition-related and ongoing merger activities related to the Nash-Finch merger.\nRestructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Charges, Including Goodwill Impairment - In 2018, $37.5 million of net restructuring, asset impairment and other charges were incurred, predominantly associated with a non-cash charge related to the collectability of a customer advance to an independent retailer of $32.0 million as well as charges incurred as part of the Company's retail store rationalization plans, partially offset by changes in estimates of closed store liabilities and gains on sales of real estate. Prior year results included $228.5 million of restructuring, asset impairment and other charges that consisted primarily of non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $189.0 million related to the Retail segment and $39.4 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges primarily associated with the underlying performance of Company's retail store base and the execution of its store rationalization program.\nOperating Earnings (Loss)\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change in\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food Distribution\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 48,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34,363\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Military\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,322\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (196,759\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 212,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating earnings (loss)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (106,675\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 177,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company reported operating earnings of $70.5 million in 2018 compared to an operating loss of $106.7 million in the prior year. The increase of $177.2 million was primarily attributable to prior year non-cash goodwill and asset impairment charges, predominantly related to the Retail segment. The increase was also attributable to higher sales volumes and lower administrative costs, partially offset by the charge associated with the customer advance, a decrease in gross profit rates, and increases in warehousing and transportation costs.\nFood Distribution operating earnings decreased $34.4 million, or 41.3%, to $48.8 million in 2018 from $83.1 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily attributable to the charge on the customer advance, the voluntary product recall, higher transportation costs associated with the roll-out of a significant new customer program and higher LIFO expense, partially offset by higher sales volume and lower healthcare and administrative costs.\nMilitary operating earnings decreased $1.3 million, or 18.9%, to $5.6 million in 2018 from $7.0 million in the prior year. The decrease was attributable to higher transportation costs, operational issues at one distribution center and higher LIFO expense, partially offset by lower administrative costs, lower integration costs, higher sales volume and the gain on the sale of real estate.\nRetail operating earnings increased $212.9 million to $16.1 million in 2018 compared to an operating loss of $196.8 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to goodwill and asset impairment charges in the prior year. Other significant factors include lower health care and other benefits and the closure of underperforming stores, partially offset by lower comparable store sales, higher fees paid to pharmacy benefit managers, as well as acquisition and integration expenses related to the Martin's acquisition.\nInterest Expense - Interest expense increased $5.1 million, or 20.3%, to $30.5 million in 2018 from $25.3 million in the prior year primarily due to an increase in interest rates compared to the prior year.\nIncome Taxes - The Company's effective income tax rates were 17.0% and 60.0% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Differences from the federal statutory rate in the current year are primarily due to the lapse of the statute of limitations for an uncertain tax position and tax credits, partially offset by tax expense related to stock-based compensation and state income taxes. Differences from the federal statutory rate in the prior year were primarily due to the re-measurement of deferred taxes, state taxes, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and charitable product donations. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company re-measured its deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect a change in the federal statutory rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), enacted on December 22, 2017. As a result, the Company realized an income tax benefit of $26.0 million related to 2017.

The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to contributions from the Caito acquisition, organic growth of 4.1% in the Food Distribution segment, new military commissary business in the Southwest in the second half of the year and increased contributions from the DeCA private brand program, partly offset by lower comparable sales at DeCA operated locations and lower sales in the Retail segment resulting from the closure and sale of retail stores and a decrease in comparable store sales.\nFood Distribution net sales, after intercompany eliminations, increased $546.9 million, or 16.7%, to $3.83 billion in 2017 from $3.28 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to contributions from the Caito acquisition and organic growth of 3.7% related to incremental sales volume to existing customers.\nMilitary net sales decreased $53.0 million, or 2.4%, to $2.14 billion in 2017 from $2.20 billion in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales at the DeCA operated locations, partially offset by new business in the Southwest and contributions from the DeCA private brand program.\nRetail net sales decreased $91.2 million, or 4.4%, to $1.99 billion in 2017 from $2.08 billion in 2016. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to $60.8 million of lower sales resulting from the closures and sales of retail stores as well as negative comparable store sales, partially offset by the impact of higher fuel prices. Comparable store sales for the year, excluding fuel, were negative 2.4%.\nGross Profit - Gross profit increased $33.4 million, or 3.0%, to $1.14 billion in 2017 compared to $1.11 billion in 2016. As a percent of net sales, gross profit decreased from 14.7% to 14.4% due to several factors, most notably the increased mix of Food Distribution sales as a percentage of total sales. The rate was also impacted by margin investments at both Retail and Food Distribution, the cycling of a significant 2016 LIFO benefit and lower fuel margins, partially offset by higher margin rates in the Military segment.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses - SG&A expenses increased $51.8 million, or 5.4%, to $1,015.0 million in 2017 from $963.2 million in 2016, representing 12.7% of net sales in both years. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily attributable to higher operational expenses related to the Caito acquisition, increased healthcare costs and higher transportation and occupancy costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation and other cost savings.\nMerger/Acquisition and Integration Expenses - In 2017, $8.1 million of merger/acquisition and integration expenses were incurred mainly associated with the Caito and BRT acquisition, and to a lesser extent, other acquisition-related and ongoing merger activities. The Company's 2016 results included $7.0 million of merger/acquisition and integration expenses primarily associated with the Nash-Finch merger, particularly system upgrades and implementations, as well as costs incurred in connection with 2016 and 2015 acquisitions.\nRestructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Charges, Including Goodwill Impairment - In 2017, $228.5 million of net restructuring, asset impairment and other charges were incurred, predominantly associated with goodwill and asset impairment charges. The Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $189.0 million related to the Retail segment. The impairment was driven by significantly lower than expected Retail operating results due to an increasingly competitive retail environment and the related pricing pressures that are anticipated to negatively impact gross margin, operating profit, and future cash flows. The Company also recorded $39.4 million of restructuring and asset impairment and restructuring charges primarily associated with the underlying performance of Company's retail store base and the execution of its store rationalization program. The Company's 2016 results included $32.1 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges that consisted primarily of impairment charges related to four underperforming retail stores and restructuring charges primarily related to three retail stores and two food distribution centers. The facilities were closed as part of the Company's retail store and warehouse rationalization plan.\nOperating (Loss) Earnings\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change in\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Food Distribution\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,181\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Military\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,247\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (196,759\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (208,431\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating (loss) earnings\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (106,675\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (215,859\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company reported an operating loss of $106.7 million in 2017 compared to operating earnings of $109.2 million in 2016. The decrease of $215.9 million was primarily attributable to 2017 non-cash goodwill and restructuring and asset impairment charges of $228.5 million, predominantly related to the Retail segment, higher costs associated with Caito operations and Fresh Kitchen start-up activities, as well as increased LIFO and health care expenses, partly offset by lower incentive compensation expense and various cost savings initiatives.\nFood Distribution operating earnings decreased $2.2 million, or 2.6%, to $83.1 million in 2017 from $85.3 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to Caito operations and Fresh Kitchen start-up activities and higher LIFO expense, partially offset by net sales growth from new and existing customers, lower incentive compensation and lower operating expenses associated with various cost savings initiatives.\nMilitary operating earnings decreased $5.3 million, or 43.0%, to $7.0 million in 2017 from $12.2 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales at the DeCA-operated commissaries, higher supply chain costs associated with industry-wide transportation cost challenges, onboarding and ramping up new and high-growth lines of business and increased healthcare and LIFO expense, partially offset by growth from the new military commissary business in the Southwest and the DeCA private brand program, as well as lower incentive compensation and margin improvements.\nRetail reported an operating loss of ($196.8) million in 2017 compared to operating earnings of $11.7 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to goodwill and higher asset impairment charges, lower comparable store sales, investments in margin and store labor, and higher occupancy and healthcare costs, partly offset by lower costs related to incentive compensation, depreciation, merger/acquisition and integration and closed stores.\nInterest Expense - Interest expense increased $6.2 million, or 32.8%, to $25.3 million in 2017 from $19.1 million in 2016 primarily due to increased borrowings related to the Caito and BRT acquisition and the timing of working capital requirements.\nDebt Extinguishment - A loss on debt extinguishment of $0.4 million was incurred in 2017 in connection with the pay down of the term loan component of the senior secured credit facility. A loss on debt extinguishment of $0.2 million was incurred in 2016 in connection with the amendment of the senior secured credit facility.\nIncome Taxes - The Company's effective income tax rates were 60.0% and 36.6% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Differences from the federal statutory rate are primarily due to the re-measurement of deferred taxes mentioned previously, state taxes, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and charitable product donations in the current year and state taxes in 2016.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company also provides information regarding adjusted operating earnings, adjusted earnings from continuing operations, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( adjusted EBITDA\u201d). These are non-GAAP financial measures, as defined below, and are used by management to allocate resources, assess performance against its peers and evaluate overall performance. The Company believes these measures provide useful information for both management and its investors. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide additional understanding of the trends and special circumstances that affect its business. These measures provide useful supplemental information that helps investors to establish a basis for expected performance and the ability to evaluate actual results against that expectation. The measures, when considered in connection with GAAP results, can be used to assess the overall performance of the Company as well as assess the Company's performance against its peers. These measures are also used as a basis for certain compensation programs sponsored by the Company. In addition, securities analysts, fund managers and other shareholders and stakeholders that communicate with the Company request its financial results in these adjusted formats.\nCurrent year adjusted operating earnings, adjusted earnings from continuing operations, and adjusted EBITDA exclude start-up costs associated with the new Fresh Kitchen operation through the start-up period, which concluded during the first quarter. The Fresh Kitchen is a newly constructed facility that provides the Company with the ability to process, cook, and package fresh protein-based foods and complete meal solutions. Given the Fresh Kitchen represents a new line of business for the Company, the start-up activities associated with testing, training, and preparing the Fresh Kitchen for production, as well as incorporating the related operations into the business, are considered non-operational\u201d or non-core\u201d in nature. The 2017 retirement stock compensation award represents incremental compensation expense in connection with an executive retirement that is also considered non-operational\u201d or non-core\u201d in nature.\nAdjusted Operating Earnings\nAdjusted operating earnings is a non-GAAP operating financial measure that the Company defines as operating earnings plus or minus adjustments for items that do not reflect the ongoing operating activities of the Company and costs associated with the closing of operational locations.\nThe Company believes that adjusted operating earnings provide a meaningful representation of its operating performance for the Company as a whole and for its operating segments. The Company considers adjusted operating earnings as an additional way to measure operating performance on an ongoing basis. Adjusted operating earnings is meant to reflect the ongoing operating performance of all of its distribution and retail operations; consequently, it excludes the impact of items that could be considered non-operating\u201d or non-core\u201d in nature, and also excludes the contributions of activities classified as discontinued operations. Because adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings by segment are performance measures that management uses to allocate resources, assess performance against its peers and evaluate overall performance, the Company believes it provides useful information for both management and its investors. In addition, securities analysts, fund managers and other shareholders and stakeholders that communicate with the Company request its operating financial results in an adjusted operating earnings format.\nAdjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings by segment are not measures of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and should not be considered as a substitute for operating earnings, cash flows from operating activities and other income or cash flow statement data. The Company's definitions of adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings by segment may not be identical to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of operating earnings (loss) to adjusted operating earnings for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

measure that the Company defines as earnings from continuing operations plus or minus adjustments for items that do not reflect the ongoing operating activities of the Company and costs associated with the closing of operational locations.\nThe Company believes that adjusted earnings from continuing operations provide a meaningful representation of its operating performance for the Company. The Company considers adjusted earnings from continuing operations as an additional way to measure operating performance on an ongoing basis. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations is meant to reflect the ongoing operating performance of all of its distribution and retail operations; consequently, it excludes the impact of items that could be considered non-operating\u201d or non-core\u201d in nature, and also excludes the contributions of activities classified as discontinued operations. Because adjusted earnings from continuing operations is a performance measure that management uses to allocate resources, assess performance against its peers and evaluate overall performance, the Company believes it provides useful information for both management and its investors. In addition, securities analysts, fund managers and other shareholders and stakeholders that communicate with the Company request its operating financial results in adjusted earnings from continuing operations format.\nAdjusted earnings from continuing operations is not a measure of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should not be considered as a substitute for net earnings, cash flows from operating activities and other income or cash flow statement data. The Company's definition of adjusted earnings from continuing operations may not be identical to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of earnings

Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, assets held for sale, long-lived assets, income taxes, self-insurance reserves, restructuring costs, retirement benefits, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. Based on the Company's ongoing review, the Company makes adjustments it considers appropriate under the facts and circumstances. This discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company believes these accounting policies and others set forth in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The Company has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nAn accounting policy is considered critical if: a) it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and b) different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company considers the following accounting policies to represent the more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with approximately 88.9% of the Company's inventories valued using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO\u201d) method. The remaining inventories are valued on the first-in, first-out ( FIFO\u201d) method. The Company accounts for its Food Distribution and Military inventory using a perpetual system and utilizes the retail inventory method ( RIM\u201d) to value inventory for center store products in the Retail segment. Under the RIM, inventory is stated at cost with cost of sales and gross margin calculated by applying a cost ratio to the retail value of inventories. RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry. Inherent in the RIM calculations are certain significant management judgments and estimates, including inventory shortages and cost-to-retail ratios, which impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the resulting gross profit. Management consistently applies its RIM valuations by product category and believes that the Company's RIM provides an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost.\nFresh, pharmacy and fuel products are accounted for at cost in the Retail segment. The Company evaluates inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in its facilities. The Company records allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing inventories, including those used in past calculations, are reviewed and applied consistently, and as a result, the Company believes the estimates and assumptions are both reasonable and accurate. The Company does not anticipate future changes to the estimates or assumptions used in valuing inventories, but it does anticipate that inflation and/or deflation will continue to have a significant impact on the Company's LIFO reserve as price changes represent a significant driver of the calculation.\nVendor Funds, Allowances and Credits\nThe Company receives funds from many of its vendors when purchasing products to sell to its corporate owned retail stores and independent retailers. Given the highly promotional nature of the retail supermarket industry, vendor allowances are generally intended to help defray the costs of promotion, advertising and selling the vendor's products. Vendor allowances that relate to the Company's buying and merchandising activities consist primarily of promotional allowances, which are generally allowances on purchased quantities and, to a lesser extent, slotting allowances, which are billed to vendors for the Company's merchandising costs such as setting up warehouse infrastructure. The proper recognition and timing of accounting for these items are significant to the reporting of the results of the Company's operations. Vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold. Lump sum payments received for multi-year contracts are amortized over the life of the contracts based on contractual terms. The amount and timing of recognition of vendor funds as well as the amount of vendor funds to be recognized as a reduction to ending inventory requires management judgment and estimates. Management determines these amounts based on estimates of current year purchase volume using forecast and historical data and review of average inventory turnover data. These judgments and estimates impact the Company's reported gross profit, operating earnings (loss) and inventory amounts. The Company believes its historical estimates and use of this methodology have been reliable in the past and will continue to be reliable in the future.\nCustomer Exposure and Credit Risk\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors. In most circumstances when the Company becomes aware of factors that may indicate a deterioration in a specific customer's ability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., reductions of product purchases, deteriorating store conditions, changes in payment patterns), the Company records a specific reserve to reduce the receivable to an amount the Company reasonably believes will be collected. In determining the adequacy of the reserves, the Company analyzes factors such as the value of any collateral, customer financial statements, historical collection experience, aging of receivables and other economic and industry factors. It is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the collectability based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts. If circumstances change (e.g., further evidence of material adverse creditworthiness, additional accounts become credit risks, store closures), the Company's estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount, including to zero.\nFunds Advanced to Independent Retailers. From time to time, the Company may advance funds to independent retailers which are earned by the retailers primarily through achieving specified purchase volume requirements, as outlined in their supply agreements with the Company, or in limited instances, for remaining a SpartanNash customer for a specified time period. These advances must be repaid if the purchase volume requirements are not met or if the retailer does not remain a customer for the specified time period. In the event these retailers are unable to repay these advances or otherwise experience an event of default, the Company may be unable to recover the unearned portion of the funds advanced to these independent retailers. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these advances based on a number of factors, including anticipated and historical purchase volume, the value of any collateral, customer financial statements and other economic and industry factors, and establishes a reserve for the advances as necessary. As of December 29, 2018, the Company has unearned advanced funds of approximately $85.3 million, and has established a reserve of $35.1 million for these advances.\nGuarantees of Debt and Lease Obligations of Others. The Company may guarantee debt and lease obligations of independent retailers. In the event these retailers are unable to meet their debt service payments or otherwise experience an event of default, the Company would be unconditionally liable for the outstanding balance of their debt and lease obligations, which would be due in accordance with the underlying agreements.\nThe Company has guaranteed the outstanding lease obligations of certain independent retailers. These guarantees, which are secured by certain business assets and personal guarantees of the respective independent retailers, represent the maximum undiscounted payments the Company would be required to make in the event of default. The Company believes these independent retailers will be able to perform under the lease agreements and that no payments will be required, and no loss will be incurred under the guarantees. A liability representing the fair value of the obligations assumed under the guarantees is included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company also subleases and assigns various leases to third parties. In circumstances when the Company becomes aware of factors that indicate deterioration in a third party's ability to meet its financial obligations guaranteed or assigned by SpartanNash, the Company records a specific reserve in the amount the Company reasonably believes it will be obligated to pay on the third party's behalf, net of any anticipated recoveries from the third party. In determining the adequacy of these reserves, the Company analyzes factors such as those described above in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - Methodology\u201d and Lease Commitments.\u201d It is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the obligations based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts, with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on operating results and cash flows. Triggering these guarantees or obligations under assigned leases would not, however, result in cross default of the Company's debt, but could restrict resources available for general business initiatives. Refer to Note 15, Concentration of Credit Risk, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding customer exposure and credit risk.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with any excess purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired being recorded as goodwill.\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by the Company but are inherently uncertain. Also, determining the estimated useful life of an intangible asset requires judgment based on the Company's expected use of the asset, as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. The Company typically utilizes the income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which discounts the projected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuation reflect a consideration of other marketplace competition and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability) and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis (during the last quarter of the year), or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company has three reporting units, which are the same as the Company's reportable segments; however, there is no goodwill recorded within the Retail or Military segments. Fair values are determined based on the discounted cash flows and comparable market values of each reporting segment. If a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company's goodwill impairment analysis also includes a comparison of the aggregate estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the Company's total market capitalization. Therefore, a significant and sustained decline in the Company's stock price could result in goodwill impairment charges. During times of financial market volatility, significant judgment is given to determine the underlying cause of the decline and whether stock price declines are short-term in nature or indicative of an event or change in circumstances.\nDetermining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires that the Company make significant estimates and assumptions, including long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate discount rates. The Company's judgments are based on the perspective of a market participant, historical experience, current market trends and other information. In estimating future cash flows, the Company utilizes internally generated three-year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures, and a long-term assumed growth rate of cash flows for periods after the three-year forecast. The future estimated cash flows are discounted based upon the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which was 11.9% for the Food Distribution reporting unit. The determination of the weighted average cost of capital incorporates current interest rates, equity risk premiums, and other market-based expectations regarding expected investment returns. The Company generally develops its forecasts based on recent sales data for existing operations and other factors. While the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different assumptions could result in different outcomes.\nAs of the date of the most recent goodwill impairment test, which utilized data and assumptions as of October 6, 2018, the Food Distribution reporting unit had a fair value that was in excess of its carrying value. The Company has sufficient available information, both current and historical, to support its assumptions, judgments and estimates used in the goodwill impairment test; however, if actual results for the Food Distribution segment are not consistent with the Company's estimates, it could result in the Company recording a non-cash impairment charge.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Other Than Goodwill\nLong-lived assets to be held and used are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When the undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to recover an asset's carrying amount, the fair value is compared to the carrying value to determine the impairment loss to be recorded. Long-lived assets are evaluated at the asset-group level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Impairments of long-lived assets were $2.6 million, $33.7 million and $15.6 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nEstimates of future cash flows and expected sales prices are judgments based upon the Company's experience and knowledge of operations. These estimates project cash flows several years into the future and are affected by changes in the economy, the competitive environment, real estate market conditions and inflation.\nLong-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. Management determines fair values using independent appraisals, quotes or expected sales prices developed by internal real estate professionals. Estimates of expected sales prices are judgments based upon the Company's experience, knowledge of market conditions and current offers received. Changes in market conditions, the economic environment and other factors, including the Company's ability to effectively compete and react to competitor openings, can significantly impact these estimates. While the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different assumptions could result in a different outcome.\nReserves for Closed Properties\nThe Company records reserves for closed properties that are subject to long-term lease commitments based upon the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term, net of estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably expected to be obtained for the property. Future cash flows are based on contractual lease terms and knowledge of the geographic area in which the closed site is located. These estimates are subject to multiple factors, including inflation, ability to sublease the property and other economic conditions. Internally developed estimates of sublease rentals are based upon the geographic areas in which the properties are located, the results of previous efforts to sublease similar properties, and the current economic environment. Reserves may be adjusted in the future based upon the actual resolution of each of these factors At December 29, 2018, reserves for closed properties for distribution center and store lease and ancillary costs total $16.4 million. Based upon the current economic environment, the Company does not believe that it is likely to obtain any sublease rentals. A 5% increase/decrease in future estimated ancillary costs would result in a $0.4 million increase/decrease in the restructuring charge liability.\nInsurance Reserves\nSpartanNash is self-insured through self-insurance retentions or high deductible programs for workers' compensation, general liability, and automobile liability, and is also self-insured for healthcare costs. Self-insurance liabilities are recorded based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Workers' compensation, general liability and automobile liabilities are actuarially estimated based on available historical information on an undiscounted basis. The Company has purchased stop-loss coverage to limit its exposure on a per claim basis for its self-insurance retentions and high deductible programs. On a per claim basis, the Company's exposure is up to $0.5 million for workers' compensation and general liability, $1.0 million for automobile liability, and $0.5 million for healthcare per covered life per year. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to self-insurance reserves.\nAny projection of losses concerning insurance reserves is subject to a degree of variability. Among the causes of variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, discount rates, litigation trends, changing regulations, legal interpretations, benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns. Although the Company's estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, such changes could have a material impact on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities. The impact of many of these variables may be difficult to estimate.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nAccounting for defined benefit plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based on vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the time period each associate works. The significant factors affecting the Company's pension costs are the fair values of plan assets and the selections of management's key assumptions, including the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used by the Company's actuary to calculate its liability. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in interest rates and investment returns, in selecting these assumptions. The discount rate is based on current investment yields on high quality fixed-income investments and projected cash flow obligations. Expected return on plan assets is based on projected returns by asset class on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices, as well as the Company's target asset allocation, which is designed to meet the Company's long-term pension requirements. While the Company believes the assumptions selected are reasonable, significant differences in its actual experience, plan amendments or significant changes in the fair value of its plan assets may materially affect its pension obligations and its future expense.\nSensitivities to changes in the major assumptions for the SpartanNash Company Pension Plan and the SpartanNash Company Retiree Medical Plan as of December 29, 2018, are as follows:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Projected\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions, except percentages)\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease / (Increase)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease / (Increase)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected return on plan assets - SpartanNash Company Pension Plan\n</td> <td> +/- 0.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $0.3 / $(0.3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate - SpartanNash Company Pension Plan\n</td> <td> +/- 0.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $3.2 / $(3.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate - SpartanNash Company Retiree Medical Plan\n</td> <td> +/- 0.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $0.7 / $(0.9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRefer to Note 11, Associate Retirement Plans, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the assumptions used to estimate the cost of benefits and for details related to changes in the funded status of the defined benefit pension plans.\nIncome Taxes\nSpartanNash is subject to periodic audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other state and local taxing authorities. These audits may challenge certain of the Company's tax positions, such as the timing and amount of income credits and deductions and the allocation of taxable income to various tax jurisdictions. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. These tax uncertainties are reviewed as facts and circumstances change and are adjusted accordingly. This requires significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the Company's effective income tax rate and cash flows in future years. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which it expects the differences to reverse. Refer to Note 13, Income Tax, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flow Information\nThe following table summarizes the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows for 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flow activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 171,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 157,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64,156\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (315,393\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (68,227\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (104,300\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 254,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (86,594\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (284\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (137\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (738\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,684\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents at end of year\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased for 2018 compared to 2017 by approximately $118.8 million primarily due to lower working capital requirements, particularly inventory and accounts receivable, compared to the prior year.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased for 2017 versus 2016 by approximately $104.3 million. The change was primarily due to the timing of working capital requirements, particularly higher accounts receivable and inventory balances associated with new distribution business and incremental sales to certain high-growth distribution customers. The timing of year-end payments impacting accounts payable balances also contributed to the change in cash flows, which was partly offset by lower customer advances compared to the 2016.\nDuring 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company made $0.1 million, $10.7 million and $35.8 million, respectively, in net income tax payments.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $251.2 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the Caito and BRT acquisition made in the prior year.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $247.2 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the Caito and BRT acquisition made in 2017\nThe Food Distribution, Military and Retail segments utilized 46.6%, 4.9% and 48.5% of capital expenditures, respectively, for 2018. Expenditures for 2018 primarily related to retail store remodels and upgrades, which include five store remodels, various equipment purchases, and IT system upgrades and implementations to better streamline processes and meet the operational and supply chain needs of the Company. The Company expects capital expenditures to range from $85.0 million to $93.0 million for 2019.\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities increased $358.3 million during 2018 over 2017 primarily due to borrowings on the revolving credit facility in the prior year to fund the acquisition and working capital, as well as increases in cash provided by operating activities which were used to pay down debt in the current year.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $340.6 million during 2017 over 2016 primarily due to borrowings on the revolving credit facility to fund the Caito and BRT acquisition and timing of working capital requirements, partially offset by a $26.0 million increase in cash used for the repurchase of common stock.\nNet cash used in discontinued operations. Net cash used in discontinued operations contains the net cash flows of the Company's Food Distribution and Retail discontinued operations and is primarily composed of facility maintenance expenditures.\nDebt Management\nTotal debt, including capital lease obligations and current maturities, decreased $51.9 million to $698.1 million as of December 29, 2018 from $750.0 million at December 30, 2017. The decrease in total debt was driven by principal payments in the current year due to an increase in cash provided by operations.\nIn December 2018, SpartanNash Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to the Company's Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The principal changes of the amendment included an extension of the maturity date of the loans from December 20, 2021 to December 18, 2023, the ability to increase the size of the Tranche A revolving loan to $975 million from $900 million, an amendment to the interest rate grid such that rates for the Tranche A-1 revolving loans are now LIBOR plus 2.25% to LIBOR plus 2.50%, a reload of the $60 million Tranche A-2 term loan and a reset of certain advance rates for the borrowing base. The Credit Agreement provides for borrowings of $1.1 billion, consisting of three tranches: a $975 million secured revolving credit facility (Tranche A), a $40 million secured revolving credit facility (Tranche A-1), and a $60 million term loan (Tranche A-2). The Company has the ability to increase the size of the Credit Agreement by an additional $325 million, subject to certain conditions in the Credit Agreement. The Company's obligations under the related Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company's personal and real property. The Company may repay all loans in whole or in part at any time without penalty.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and its senior secured credit facility. As of December 29, 2018, the senior secured credit facility had outstanding borrowings of $660.9 million. Additional available borrowings under the Company's $1.1 billion Credit Agreement are based on stipulated advance rates on eligible assets, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintains Excess Availability of 10% of the borrowing base, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company had excess availability after the 10% requirement of $262.0 million at December 29, 2018. Payment of dividends and repurchases of outstanding shares are permitted, provided that certain levels of excess availability are maintained. The credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit, of which $11.7 million were outstanding as of December 29, 2018. The revolving credit facility matures December 18, 2023 and is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets. The Company believes that cash generated from operating activities and available borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, and debt service obligations for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that the business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that the Company will maintain its ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Company's current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) was 2.10:1 at December 29, 2018 compared to 2.03:1 at December 30, 2017, and its investment in working capital was $524.6 million at December 29, 2018 compared to $509.7 million at December 30, 2017. Net debt to total capital ratio decreased to 0.49:1 at December 29, 2018 from 0.50:1 at December 30, 2017. Total net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as long-term debt and capital lease obligations, plus current maturities of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, less cash and cash equivalents. The Company believes both management and its investors find the information useful because it reflects the amount of long-term debt obligations that are not covered by available cash and temporary investments. Total net debt is not a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may differ from similarly titled measures of other companies.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of long-term debt and capital lease obligations to total net long-term debt and capital lease obligations as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017.\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td>

postretirement benefit obligations. The Company expects to make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2019, as necessary, to fund the distributions in connection with the termination of the Plan described within Note 11, Associate Retirement Plans. Also excludes contributions under various multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans, which totals $13.3 million and $13.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 29, 2018. For additional information, refer to Note 11, Associate Retirement Plans, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Also excludes unrecognized tax liabilities, as the Company cannot reasonably estimate the timing of potential cash settlement. For additional information, refer to Note 13, Income Tax, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n (b) Refer to Note 7, Long-Term Debt, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n (c) Operating and capital lease obligations do not include common area maintenance, insurance or tax payments for which the Company is also obligated.

At December 29, 2018, $3.0 million in advanced contract monies has been received under these contracts where recognition has been deferred on the consolidated balance sheet. If the Company does not fulfill these purchase obligations, it would only be obligated to repay the unearned upfront contract monies. The amount shown here does not include the following: a) purchase obligations made in the normal course of business as those obligations involve purchase orders based on current Company needs that are typically cancelable and/or fulfilled by vendors within a very short period of time; b) agreements that are cancelable by the Company without significant penalty, including contracts for routine outsourced services; and c) contracts that do not contain minimum annual purchase commitments but include other standard contractual considerations that must be fulfilled in order to earn advanced contract monies that have been received. \nThe Company has also made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond December 29, 2018. These commitments include standby letters of credit and guarantees of certain Food Distribution customer lease obligations.

Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is generally permitted to pay dividends in any year up to an amount such that all cash dividends, together with any cash distributions and share repurchases, do not exceed $35.0 million. Additionally, the Company is generally permitted to pay cash dividends in excess of $35.0 million in any year so long as its Excess Availability, as defined in the Credit Agreement, is in excess of 10% of the Total Borrowing Base, as defined in the Credit Agreement, before and after giving effect to the repurchases and dividends. Although the Company currently expects to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend, adoption of a dividend policy does not commit the Board of Directors (the Board\u201d) to declare future dividends. Each future dividend will be considered and declared by the Board at its discretion. Whether the Board continues to declare dividends depends on a number of factors, including the Company's future financial condition, anticipated profitability and cash flows and compliance with the terms of its credit facilities.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to recently adopted accounting standards, as well as the anticipated effect of any impending accounting standards.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAbout SpartanNash\nSpartanNash, headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is a leading multi-regional grocery distributor and grocery retailer whose core businesses include distributing grocery products to a diverse group of independent and chain retailers, its corporate owned retail stores, and military commissaries and exchanges in the United States. The Company operates three reportable business segments: Food Distribution, Military and Retail.\nThe Company's Food Distribution segment provides a wide variety of nationally branded and private brand grocery products and perishable food products to approximately 2,100 independent retailers, the Company's corporate owned retail stores, food service distributors and various other customers. Through its Food Distribution segment, the Company also services national retailers, including Dollar General. Sales to Dollar General are made to more than 15,500 of its retail locations. Combined with the Military segment, the Company currently services customers in all 50 states. The Company processes fresh-cut fruits and vegetables and other value-added meal solutions and supplies these products to grocery retailers and food service distributors. Through the Fresh Kitchen facility, the Company processes, cooks and packages fresh protein-based foods and complete meal solutions for a number of different customers.\nThe Company's Military segment contracts with manufacturers to distribute a wide variety of grocery products, including dry groceries, beverages, meat, and frozen foods, primarily to military commissaries and exchanges located in the United States, the District of Columbia, Europe, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Bahrain, Djibouti and Egypt. The Company is also the DeCA exclusive worldwide supplier of private brand grocery and related products to U.S. military commissaries. The Company has over 40 years of experience acting as a distributor to U.S. military commissaries and exchanges.\nThe Company's Retail segment operated 139 corporate owned retail stores in the Midwest region primarily under the banners of Family Fare Supermarkets, D&W Fresh Markets, VG's Grocery, Dan's Supermarket and Family Fresh Market as of December 29, 2018. The Company also offered pharmacy services in 82 of its corporate owned stores (of which 72 pharmacies are owned) and operated 29 fuel centers. The retail stores have a neighborhood market\u201d strategy that focuses on value beyond price, affordable wellness, and commitment to local products.\nThe Company's fiscal year end is the Saturday closest to December 31. The following discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ending or ended December 28, 2019 ( 2019\u201d), December 29, 2018 (\"2018\" or current year\u201d), December 30, 2017 ( 2017\u201d or prior year\u201d) and December 31, 2016 ( 2016\u201d), all of which include 52 weeks. All fiscal quarters are 12 weeks, except for the Company's first quarter, which is 16 weeks and will generally include the Easter holiday. The fourth quarter includes the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, and depending on the fiscal year end, may include the New Year's holiday.\nIn certain geographic areas, the Company's sales and operating performance may vary with seasonality. Many stores are dependent on tourism, and therefore, are most affected by seasons and weather patterns, including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of snowfall during the winter months and the range of temperature during the summer months.\nOverview of 2018\nIn 2018, the Company executed against its long-term strategic objective of becoming a growth company that is focused on developing a national, highly efficient distribution platform known for solving unique and complex logistical issues and evolving its primary retail brand to deliver innovative solutions, both of which service a diverse customer base. The Company also began a company-wide initiative late in the fourth quarter to drive sustainable profit improvements.\nThe Company's 2018 accomplishments and developments include:\nFood Distribution\n \u2022 During 2018, the Company expanded its supply chain capabilities to provide better solutions to its customers more efficiently and in more markets. The Company enhanced its ability to make deliveries to the east coast and added a centralized produce distribution solution to its western region. The addition of the produce distribution solution will result in higher quality products while incurring fewer costs related to transportation and waste. The Company eliminated redundancy in its network, while shifting certain operations closer to its customers in an effort to reduce freight miles and provide faster fulfillment. The Company also invested in its labor force, including drivers and warehousemen, fleet, and IT systems in order to provide for further efficiency and execution within the supply chain going forward. \n \u2022 The Company was recognized in the current year for its innovation in marketing and merchandising. These efforts have led to the launch of various product and marketing campaigns which have supported the sales trends in the traditional distribution business. At the same time, the Company remains committed to collaboration with independent retailers and launched programs to strengthen these partnerships and to support their success in the retail market. These programs included solutions ranging from e-commerce to customer loyalty and retention programs. \n \u2022 The Company realized sales growth in its Food Distribution segment, due to incremental distribution volume from both existing and new customer programs, of 4.3% over the prior year. Sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 marked the 12th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth for the segment. The Company remains focused on partnering with independent retailers to support their operations and enhance the consumer experience. \n \u2022 Within the food processing operations, the Company has seen year-over-year progress related to its efforts to improve efficiency and an expansion of its fresh offerings as a result of interest from new types of customers. The Company expects further progress in its profitability as it becomes more experienced at seamlessly onboarding new business opportunities and is able to continue to develop an experienced workforce. The Company also consolidated the produce planning and replenishment processes between food processing and other Food Distribution operations and continues to look for opportunities to drive leverage and synergies through process consolidation and technology. \nMilitary\n \u2022 The Military segment continued to support DeCA in the expansion of its private brand program, which has contributed to overall sales growth in 2018. In connection with the overall arrangement, the Company leveraged its private brand capabilities and expertise to help design and develop both DeCA's proprietary and commissary-specific private brands. As of December 29, 2018, the Company had launched over 700 SKUs of private brand products in the DeCA system. The Company looks forward to continuing its partnership with DeCA and anticipates 1,000 total SKUs will be active within the program by the end of 2019. \n \u2022 The Company was dedicated to their support of military commissaries which were significantly impacted by Hurricane Florence during the third quarter of 2018. The Company responded to urgent requests of DeCA and made additional deliveries of water to these commissaries. \n \u2022 In the third quarter of 2018, the Company secured a significant contract for incremental business with an existing customer through the continued demonstration of superior customer service and execution capabilities. Incremental sales with this customer commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018 which, combined with continued increases in volume from the private brand program, offset the challenges of operating in a commissary environment which continues to experience negative sales trends. \nRetail\n \u2022 The Company continued to make strategic Retail segment investments through the execution of five store remodels during 2018. These investments have supported the Company's objectives related to brand repositioning and it expects that they will help improve customer satisfaction and contribute to the achievement of sequential growth in fiscal 2019 comparable store sales. The Company also continued its store rationalization program, and in connection with overall business strategies, closed six retail stores in connection with lease expirations and store rationalization plans during the year. \n \u2022 The Company expanded Fast Lane, its e-commerce solution, which offers online ordering and curbside pick-up service at approximately 65 retail stores, and same day delivery in several geographies as of December 29, 2018. The Company believes Fast Lane is essential to increasing customer satisfaction through quality service and convenience. Additional enhancements were made to Fast Lane in the current year which integrate yes\u201d\u2122 digital coupons into the shopping experience and provide customers with additional savings and rewards. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company also began partnerships with Instacart in several regions to offer customers additional online shopping options. Lastly, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company developed and piloted a new mobile application which allows customers to scan and bag their groceries as they shop helping them to save time and money. \nOther\n \u2022 During 2018, the Company returned $45.9 million to shareholders from share repurchases and dividend payments. The Company also improved working capital compared to the prior year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $171.7 million in 2018 compared to $52.8 million in 2017. Net cash used by investing activities was $64.2 million in 2018 compared to $315.4 million in 2017. Net long-term debt decreased $54.8 million compared to the prior year as the Company continues to work towards paying down debt. \n \u2022 In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company partnered with a third-party advisory firm to commence a company-wide initiative, Project One Team, designed to transform its culture and empower associates at all levels to drive substantial ongoing, sustainable improvements to business processes and results. Project One Team is designed to align with the Company's strategic objectives and is intended to position the Company to identify opportunities for growth and efficiency with benefits in the next one to two years. \n \u2022 During 2018, the Company remained committed to undertaking business development initiatives within both core and adjacent spaces to further its strategic objectives. In line with this strategy, the Company acquired Martin's Super Markets ( Martin's\u201d) in early 2019. Martin's is a leading Midwest independent supermarket chain which operates 21 stores in the northern Indiana and southwestern Michigan markets. \nThe accomplishments above helped position the Company for future earnings growth, but the competitive landscape and industry trends also present challenges to the Company and potential changes in trends that could impact 2019. For fiscal 2019, the Company anticipates year-over-year sales growth to continue in the Food Distribution segment driven primarily by incremental sales to existing customers and new food processing customers. Incremental business with an existing customer and contributions from the ongoing expansion of the DeCA private brand program should continue to drive sales growth in the Military segment. The Company expects sequential improvement in its Retail stores' comparable sales trend, benefiting from current year and future store remodels and the Company's brand repositioning. The Company plans to mitigate these challenges by sustaining sales growth in the Food Distribution segment, aggressively pursuing new business made available by disruption in the industry and driving adjusted operating earnings and adjusted EBITDA growth over the prior year. Additionally, the Company plans to strengthen its management team and improve supply chain capabilities, from identifying and capitalizing on freight efficiencies, to managing through tight labor markets in certain geographies, while increasing the acceptance of private brand products. The Company also plans to deliver value through the execution on Project One Team. The Company will reduce its debt levels and financial leverage ratios to facilitate achieving our strategic objectives. The Company continues to take actions that it believes will enhance the convenience and value that it provides its customers and continues to see positive results from these investments.\nResults of Operations\nCertain prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect recently adopted accounting standards.\nThe following table sets forth items from the Company's consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales and the percentage change from the preceding year:\n\nNote: Certain totals do not sum due to rounding.\nResults of Continuing Operations for 2018 Compared to 2017\nNet Sales\n\nNet sales increased $100.8 million, or 1.3%, to $8.06 billion in 2018 from $7.96 billion in 2017. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to organic growth in the Food Distribution segment and new business in the Military segment, which more than offset lower sales in the Retail segment and lower comparable sales at DeCA operated locations in the Military segment.\nFood Distribution net sales, after intercompany eliminations, increased $163.5 million, or 4.3%, to $3.99 billion in 2018 from $3.83 billion in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to sales growth from new and ongoing programs with existing customers.\nMilitary net sales increased $22.8 million, or 1.1%, to $2.17 billion in 2018 from $2.14 billion in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to new commissary business in the Southwest, incremental volume from the private brand program and a new program with an existing customer, partially offset by lower comparable sales at the DeCA operated locations.\nRetail net sales decreased $85.6 million, or 4.3%, to $1.91 billion in 2018 from $1.99 billion in the prior year. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to lower sales resulting from the closures and sales of retail stores and fuel centers of $64.0 million, as well as negative comparable store sales, partly offset by an increase in fuel prices. Comparable store sales, excluding fuel, were negative 2.0% in the current year and reflect continued strong competition within the industry. The Company defines a retail store as comparable when it is in operation for 14 accounting periods (a period equals four weeks), regardless of remodels, expansions, or relocated stores. The Company's definition of comparable store sales may differ from similarly titled measures at other companies.\nGross Profit - Gross profit represents net sales less cost of sales, which is described in further detail within Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Gross profit decreased $34.5 million, or 3.0%, to $1.11 billion in 2018 compared to $1.14 billion in the prior year. As a percent of net sales, gross profit decreased from 14.4% to 13.8% due to several factors, most notably the increased mix of Food Distribution and Military segment sales as a percentage of total sales combined with a change in customer mix within the Food Distribution segment and higher fees paid to pharmacy benefit managers in the Retail segment. The rate was also impacted by operational issues at one of the Company's distribution centers, serving both the military and food distribution segments, the voluntary product recall on certain fresh cut products and an increase in LIFO expense due to higher inflation.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses - Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages, employee benefits, warehousing costs, store occupancy costs, shipping and handling, utilities, equipment rental, depreciation (to the extent not included in Cost of Sales), out-bound freight and other administrative expenses. SG&A expenses decreased $17.6 million, or 1.7%, to $997.4 million in 2018 from $1,015.0 million in the prior year. As a percent of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased from 12.7% to 12.4% due to the mix of business operations and decreased administrative costs, partially offset by the impact of increased transportation costs within the Military and Food Distribution segments.\nMerger/Acquisition and Integration Expenses - In 2018, $4.9 million of merger/acquisition and integration expenses were incurred mainly associated with ongoing merger activities from prior years as well as costs associated with the Martin's acquisition. Prior year results included $8.1 million of merger/acquisition and integration expenses primarily associated with the Caito and BRT acquisition, and to a lesser extent, other acquisition-related and ongoing merger activities related to the Nash-Finch merger.\nRestructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Charges, Including Goodwill Impairment - In 2018, $37.5 million of net restructuring, asset impairment and other charges were incurred, predominantly associated with a non-cash charge related to the collectability of a customer advance to an independent retailer of $32.0 million as well as charges incurred as part of the Company's retail store rationalization plans, partially offset by changes in estimates of closed store liabilities and gains on sales of real estate. Prior year results included $228.5 million of restructuring, asset impairment and other charges that consisted primarily of non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $189.0 million related to the Retail segment and $39.4 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges primarily associated with the underlying performance of Company's retail store base and the execution of its store rationalization program.\nOperating Earnings (Loss)\n\nThe Company reported operating earnings of $70.5 million in 2018 compared to an operating loss of $106.7 million in the prior year. The increase of $177.2 million was primarily attributable to prior year non-cash goodwill and asset impairment charges, predominantly related to the Retail segment. The increase was also attributable to higher sales volumes and lower administrative costs, partially offset by the charge associated with the customer advance, a decrease in gross profit rates, and increases in warehousing and transportation costs.\nFood Distribution operating earnings decreased $34.4 million, or 41.3%, to $48.8 million in 2018 from $83.1 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily attributable to the charge on the customer advance, the voluntary product recall, higher transportation costs associated with the roll-out of a significant new customer program and higher LIFO expense, partially offset by higher sales volume and lower healthcare and administrative costs.\nMilitary operating earnings decreased $1.3 million, or 18.9%, to $5.6 million in 2018 from $7.0 million in the prior year. The decrease was attributable to higher transportation costs, operational issues at one distribution center and higher LIFO expense, partially offset by lower administrative costs, lower integration costs, higher sales volume and the gain on the sale of real estate.\nRetail operating earnings increased $212.9 million to $16.1 million in 2018 compared to an operating loss of $196.8 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to goodwill and asset impairment charges in the prior year. Other significant factors include lower health care and other benefits and the closure of underperforming stores, partially offset by lower comparable store sales, higher fees paid to pharmacy benefit managers, as well as acquisition and integration expenses related to the Martin's acquisition.\nInterest Expense - Interest expense increased $5.1 million, or 20.3%, to $30.5 million in 2018 from $25.3 million in the prior year primarily due to an increase in interest rates compared to the prior year.\nIncome Taxes - The Company's effective income tax rates were 17.0% and 60.0% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. Differences from the federal statutory rate in the current year are primarily due to the lapse of the statute of limitations for an uncertain tax position and tax credits, partially offset by tax expense related to stock-based compensation and state income taxes. Differences from the federal statutory rate in the prior year were primarily due to the re-measurement of deferred taxes, state taxes, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and charitable product donations. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company re-measured its deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect a change in the federal statutory rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), enacted on December 22, 2017. As a result, the Company realized an income tax benefit of $26.0 million related to 2017. Refer to Note 13, Income Tax, within the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Tax Act.\nResults of Continuing Operations for 2017 Compared to 2016\nNet Sales\n\nNet sales increased $402.7 million, or 5.3%, to $7.96 billion in 2017 from $7.56 billion in 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to contributions from the Caito acquisition, organic growth of 4.1% in the Food Distribution segment, new military commissary business in the Southwest in the second half of the year and increased contributions from the DeCA private brand program, partly offset by lower comparable sales at DeCA operated locations and lower sales in the Retail segment resulting from the closure and sale of retail stores and a decrease in comparable store sales.\nFood Distribution net sales, after intercompany eliminations, increased $546.9 million, or 16.7%, to $3.83 billion in 2017 from $3.28 billion in 2016. The increase was primarily due to contributions from the Caito acquisition and organic growth of 3.7% related to incremental sales volume to existing customers.\nMilitary net sales decreased $53.0 million, or 2.4%, to $2.14 billion in 2017 from $2.20 billion in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales at the DeCA operated locations, partially offset by new business in the Southwest and contributions from the DeCA private brand program.\nRetail net sales decreased $91.2 million, or 4.4%, to $1.99 billion in 2017 from $2.08 billion in 2016. The decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to $60.8 million of lower sales resulting from the closures and sales of retail stores as well as negative comparable store sales, partially offset by the impact of higher fuel prices. Comparable store sales for the year, excluding fuel, were negative 2.4%.\nGross Profit - Gross profit increased $33.4 million, or 3.0%, to $1.14 billion in 2017 compared to $1.11 billion in 2016. As a percent of net sales, gross profit decreased from 14.7% to 14.4% due to several factors, most notably the increased mix of Food Distribution sales as a percentage of total sales. The rate was also impacted by margin investments at both Retail and Food Distribution, the cycling of a significant 2016 LIFO benefit and lower fuel margins, partially offset by higher margin rates in the Military segment.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses - SG&A expenses increased $51.8 million, or 5.4%, to $1,015.0 million in 2017 from $963.2 million in 2016, representing 12.7% of net sales in both years. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily attributable to higher operational expenses related to the Caito acquisition, increased healthcare costs and higher transportation and occupancy costs, partially offset by lower incentive compensation and other cost savings.\nMerger/Acquisition and Integration Expenses - In 2017, $8.1 million of merger/acquisition and integration expenses were incurred mainly associated with the Caito and BRT acquisition, and to a lesser extent, other acquisition-related and ongoing merger activities. The Company's 2016 results included $7.0 million of merger/acquisition and integration expenses primarily associated with the Nash-Finch merger, particularly system upgrades and implementations, as well as costs incurred in connection with 2016 and 2015 acquisitions.\nRestructuring, Asset Impairment and Other Charges, Including Goodwill Impairment - In 2017, $228.5 million of net restructuring, asset impairment and other charges were incurred, predominantly associated with goodwill and asset impairment charges. The Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $189.0 million related to the Retail segment. The impairment was driven by significantly lower than expected Retail operating results due to an increasingly competitive retail environment and the related pricing pressures that are anticipated to negatively impact gross margin, operating profit, and future cash flows. The Company also recorded $39.4 million of restructuring and asset impairment and restructuring charges primarily associated with the underlying performance of Company's retail store base and the execution of its store rationalization program. The Company's 2016 results included $32.1 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges that consisted primarily of impairment charges related to four underperforming retail stores and restructuring charges primarily related to three retail stores and two food distribution centers. The facilities were closed as part of the Company's retail store and warehouse rationalization plan.\nOperating (Loss) Earnings\n\nThe Company reported an operating loss of $106.7 million in 2017 compared to operating earnings of $109.2 million in 2016. The decrease of $215.9 million was primarily attributable to 2017 non-cash goodwill and restructuring and asset impairment charges of $228.5 million, predominantly related to the Retail segment, higher costs associated with Caito operations and Fresh Kitchen start-up activities, as well as increased LIFO and health care expenses, partly offset by lower incentive compensation expense and various cost savings initiatives.\nFood Distribution operating earnings decreased $2.2 million, or 2.6%, to $83.1 million in 2017 from $85.3 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to Caito operations and Fresh Kitchen start-up activities and higher LIFO expense, partially offset by net sales growth from new and existing customers, lower incentive compensation and lower operating expenses associated with various cost savings initiatives.\nMilitary operating earnings decreased $5.3 million, or 43.0%, to $7.0 million in 2017 from $12.2 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales at the DeCA-operated commissaries, higher supply chain costs associated with industry-wide transportation cost challenges, onboarding and ramping up new and high-growth lines of business and increased healthcare and LIFO expense, partially offset by growth from the new military commissary business in the Southwest and the DeCA private brand program, as well as lower incentive compensation and margin improvements.\nRetail reported an operating loss of ($196.8) million in 2017 compared to operating earnings of $11.7 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to goodwill and higher asset impairment charges, lower comparable store sales, investments in margin and store labor, and higher occupancy and healthcare costs, partly offset by lower costs related to incentive compensation, depreciation, merger/acquisition and integration and closed stores.\nInterest Expense - Interest expense increased $6.2 million, or 32.8%, to $25.3 million in 2017 from $19.1 million in 2016 primarily due to increased borrowings related to the Caito and BRT acquisition and the timing of working capital requirements.\nDebt Extinguishment - A loss on debt extinguishment of $0.4 million was incurred in 2017 in connection with the pay down of the term loan component of the senior secured credit facility. A loss on debt extinguishment of $0.2 million was incurred in 2016 in connection with the amendment of the senior secured credit facility.\nIncome Taxes - The Company's effective income tax rates were 60.0% and 36.6% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Differences from the federal statutory rate are primarily due to the re-measurement of deferred taxes mentioned previously, state taxes, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and charitable product donations in the current year and state taxes in 2016.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, the Company also provides information regarding adjusted operating earnings, adjusted earnings from continuing operations, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( adjusted EBITDA\u201d). These are non-GAAP financial measures, as defined below, and are used by management to allocate resources, assess performance against its peers and evaluate overall performance. The Company believes these measures provide useful information for both management and its investors. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide additional understanding of the trends and special circumstances that affect its business. These measures provide useful supplemental information that helps investors to establish a basis for expected performance and the ability to evaluate actual results against that expectation. The measures, when considered in connection with GAAP results, can be used to assess the overall performance of the Company as well as assess the Company's performance against its peers. These measures are also used as a basis for certain compensation programs sponsored by the Company. In addition, securities analysts, fund managers and other shareholders and stakeholders that communicate with the Company request its financial results in these adjusted formats.\nCurrent year adjusted operating earnings, adjusted earnings from continuing operations, and adjusted EBITDA exclude start-up costs associated with the new Fresh Kitchen operation through the start-up period, which concluded during the first quarter. The Fresh Kitchen is a newly constructed facility that provides the Company with the ability to process, cook, and package fresh protein-based foods and complete meal solutions. Given the Fresh Kitchen represents a new line of business for the Company, the start-up activities associated with testing, training, and preparing the Fresh Kitchen for production, as well as incorporating the related operations into the business, are considered non-operational\u201d or non-core\u201d in nature. The 2017 retirement stock compensation award represents incremental compensation expense in connection with an executive retirement that is also considered non-operational\u201d or non-core\u201d in nature.\nAdjusted Operating Earnings\nAdjusted operating earnings is a non-GAAP operating financial measure that the Company defines as operating earnings plus or minus adjustments for items that do not reflect the ongoing operating activities of the Company and costs associated with the closing of operational locations.\nThe Company believes that adjusted operating earnings provide a meaningful representation of its operating performance for the Company as a whole and for its operating segments. The Company considers adjusted operating earnings as an additional way to measure operating performance on an ongoing basis. Adjusted operating earnings is meant to reflect the ongoing operating performance of all of its distribution and retail operations; consequently, it excludes the impact of items that could be considered non-operating\u201d or non-core\u201d in nature, and also excludes the contributions of activities classified as discontinued operations. Because adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings by segment are performance measures that management uses to allocate resources, assess performance against its peers and evaluate overall performance, the Company believes it provides useful information for both management and its investors. In addition, securities analysts, fund managers and other shareholders and stakeholders that communicate with the Company request its operating financial results in an adjusted operating earnings format.\nAdjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings by segment are not measures of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and should not be considered as a substitute for operating earnings, cash flows from operating activities and other income or cash flow statement data. The Company's definitions of adjusted operating earnings and adjusted operating earnings by segment may not be identical to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of operating earnings (loss) to adjusted operating earnings for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\n\nAdjusted Earnings from Continuing Operations\nAdjusted earnings from continuing operations is a non-GAAP operating financial measure that the Company defines as earnings from continuing operations plus or minus adjustments for items that do not reflect the ongoing operating activities of the Company and costs associated with the closing of operational locations.\nThe Company believes that adjusted earnings from continuing operations provide a meaningful representation of its operating performance for the Company. The Company considers adjusted earnings from continuing operations as an additional way to measure operating performance on an ongoing basis. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations is meant to reflect the ongoing operating performance of all of its distribution and retail operations; consequently, it excludes the impact of items that could be considered non-operating\u201d or non-core\u201d in nature, and also excludes the contributions of activities classified as discontinued operations. Because adjusted earnings from continuing operations is a performance measure that management uses to allocate resources, assess performance against its peers and evaluate overall performance, the Company believes it provides useful information for both management and its investors. In addition, securities analysts, fund managers and other shareholders and stakeholders that communicate with the Company request its operating financial results in adjusted earnings from continuing operations format.\nAdjusted earnings from continuing operations is not a measure of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should not be considered as a substitute for net earnings, cash flows from operating activities and other income or cash flow statement data. The Company's definition of adjusted earnings from continuing operations may not be identical to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of earnings (loss) from continuing operations to adjusted earnings from continuing operations for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\n\n (a) The income tax effect on adjustments is computed by applying the applicable tax rate to the adjustments. \n (b) Includes a $1.1 million and $4.8 million tax benefit attributable to tax planning strategies related to the Tax Act for 2018 and 2017, respectively. \nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( adjusted EBITDA\u201d) is a non-GAAP operating financial measure that the Company defines as net earnings plus interest, discontinued operations, depreciation and amortization, and other non-cash items including deferred (stock) compensation, the LIFO provision, as well as adjustments for items that do not reflect the ongoing operating activities of the Company and costs associated with the closing of operational locations.\nThe Company believes that adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful representation of its operating performance for the Company as a whole and for its operating segments. The Company considers adjusted EBITDA as an additional way to measure operating performance on an ongoing basis. Adjusted EBITDA is meant to reflect the ongoing operating performance of all of its distribution and retail operations; consequently, it excludes the impact of items that could be considered non-operating\u201d or non-core\u201d in nature, and also excludes the contributions of activities classified as discontinued operations. Because adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA by segment are performance measures that management uses to allocate resources, assess performance against its peers and evaluate overall performance, the Company believes it provides useful information for both management and its investors. In addition, securities analysts, fund managers and other shareholders and stakeholders that communicate with the Company request its operating financial results in an adjusted EBITDA format.\nAdjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA by segment are not measures of performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should not be considered as a substitute for net earnings, cash flows from operating activities and other income or cash flow statement data. The Company's definitions of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA by segment may not be identical to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of net earnings (loss) to adjusted EBITDA for 2018, 2017 and 2016.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, assets held for sale, long-lived assets, income taxes, self-insurance reserves, restructuring costs, retirement benefits, stock-based compensation, contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. Based on the Company's ongoing review, the Company makes adjustments it considers appropriate under the facts and circumstances. This discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company believes these accounting policies and others set forth in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The Company has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nAn accounting policy is considered critical if: a) it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and b) different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company considers the following accounting policies to represent the more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with approximately 88.9% of the Company's inventories valued using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO\u201d) method. The remaining inventories are valued on the first-in, first-out ( FIFO\u201d) method. The Company accounts for its Food Distribution and Military inventory using a perpetual system and utilizes the retail inventory method ( RIM\u201d) to value inventory for center store products in the Retail segment. Under the RIM, inventory is stated at cost with cost of sales and gross margin calculated by applying a cost ratio to the retail value of inventories. RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry. Inherent in the RIM calculations are certain significant management judgments and estimates, including inventory shortages and cost-to-retail ratios, which impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the resulting gross profit. Management consistently applies its RIM valuations by product category and believes that the Company's RIM provides an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost.\nFresh, pharmacy and fuel products are accounted for at cost in the Retail segment. The Company evaluates inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in its facilities. The Company records allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing inventories, including those used in past calculations, are reviewed and applied consistently, and as a result, the Company believes the estimates and assumptions are both reasonable and accurate. The Company does not anticipate future changes to the estimates or assumptions used in valuing inventories, but it does anticipate that inflation and/or deflation will continue to have a significant impact on the Company's LIFO reserve as price changes represent a significant driver of the calculation.\nVendor Funds, Allowances and Credits\nThe Company receives funds from many of its vendors when purchasing products to sell to its corporate owned retail stores and independent retailers. Given the highly promotional nature of the retail supermarket industry, vendor allowances are generally intended to help defray the costs of promotion, advertising and selling the vendor's products. Vendor allowances that relate to the Company's buying and merchandising activities consist primarily of promotional allowances, which are generally allowances on purchased quantities and, to a lesser extent, slotting allowances, which are billed to vendors for the Company's merchandising costs such as setting up warehouse infrastructure. The proper recognition and timing of accounting for these items are significant to the reporting of the results of the Company's operations. Vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold. Lump sum payments received for multi-year contracts are amortized over the life of the contracts based on contractual terms. The amount and timing of recognition of vendor funds as well as the amount of vendor funds to be recognized as a reduction to ending inventory requires management judgment and estimates. Management determines these amounts based on estimates of current year purchase volume using forecast and historical data and review of average inventory turnover data. These judgments and estimates impact the Company's reported gross profit, operating earnings (loss) and inventory amounts. The Company believes its historical estimates and use of this methodology have been reliable in the past and will continue to be reliable in the future.\nCustomer Exposure and Credit Risk\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. The Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors. In most circumstances when the Company becomes aware of factors that may indicate a deterioration in a specific customer's ability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., reductions of product purchases, deteriorating store conditions, changes in payment patterns), the Company records a specific reserve to reduce the receivable to an amount the Company reasonably believes will be collected. In determining the adequacy of the reserves, the Company analyzes factors such as the value of any collateral, customer financial statements, historical collection experience, aging of receivables and other economic and industry factors. It is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the collectability based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts. If circumstances change (e.g., further evidence of material adverse creditworthiness, additional accounts become credit risks, store closures), the Company's estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount, including to zero.\nFunds Advanced to Independent Retailers. From time to time, the Company may advance funds to independent retailers which are earned by the retailers primarily through achieving specified purchase volume requirements, as outlined in their supply agreements with the Company, or in limited instances, for remaining a SpartanNash customer for a specified time period. These advances must be repaid if the purchase volume requirements are not met or if the retailer does not remain a customer for the specified time period. In the event these retailers are unable to repay these advances or otherwise experience an event of default, the Company may be unable to recover the unearned portion of the funds advanced to these independent retailers. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these advances based on a number of factors, including anticipated and historical purchase volume, the value of any collateral, customer financial statements and other economic and industry factors, and establishes a reserve for the advances as necessary. As of December 29, 2018, the Company has unearned advanced funds of approximately $85.3 million, and has established a reserve of $35.1 million for these advances.\nGuarantees of Debt and Lease Obligations of Others. The Company may guarantee debt and lease obligations of independent retailers. In the event these retailers are unable to meet their debt service payments or otherwise experience an event of default, the Company would be unconditionally liable for the outstanding balance of their debt and lease obligations, which would be due in accordance with the underlying agreements.\nThe Company has guaranteed the outstanding lease obligations of certain independent retailers. These guarantees, which are secured by certain business assets and personal guarantees of the respective independent retailers, represent the maximum undiscounted payments the Company would be required to make in the event of default. The Company believes these independent retailers will be able to perform under the lease agreements and that no payments will be required, and no loss will be incurred under the guarantees. A liability representing the fair value of the obligations assumed under the guarantees is included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company also subleases and assigns various leases to third parties. In circumstances when the Company becomes aware of factors that indicate deterioration in a third party's ability to meet its financial obligations guaranteed or assigned by SpartanNash, the Company records a specific reserve in the amount the Company reasonably believes it will be obligated to pay on the third party's behalf, net of any anticipated recoveries from the third party. In determining the adequacy of these reserves, the Company analyzes factors such as those described above in Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - Methodology\u201d and Lease Commitments.\u201d It is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the obligations based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts, with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on operating results and cash flows. Triggering these guarantees or obligations under assigned leases would not, however, result in cross default of the Company's debt, but could restrict resources available for general business initiatives. Refer to Note 15, Concentration of Credit Risk, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding customer exposure and credit risk.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with any excess purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired being recorded as goodwill.\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by the Company but are inherently uncertain. Also, determining the estimated useful life of an intangible asset requires judgment based on the Company's expected use of the asset, as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives. The Company typically utilizes the income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which discounts the projected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuation reflect a consideration of other marketplace competition and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability) and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis (during the last quarter of the year), or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company has three reporting units, which are the same as the Company's reportable segments; however, there is no goodwill recorded within the Retail or Military segments. Fair values are determined based on the discounted cash flows and comparable market values of each reporting segment. If a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company's goodwill impairment analysis also includes a comparison of the aggregate estimated fair value of each reporting unit to the Company's total market capitalization. Therefore, a significant and sustained decline in the Company's stock price could result in goodwill impairment charges. During times of financial market volatility, significant judgment is given to determine the underlying cause of the decline and whether stock price declines are short-term in nature or indicative of an event or change in circumstances.\nDetermining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires that the Company make significant estimates and assumptions, including long-term projections of cash flows, market conditions and appropriate discount rates. The Company's judgments are based on the perspective of a market participant, historical experience, current market trends and other information. In estimating future cash flows, the Company utilizes internally generated three-year forecasts for sales and operating profits, including capital expenditures, and a long-term assumed growth rate of cash flows for periods after the three-year forecast. The future estimated cash flows are discounted based upon the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital, which was 11.9% for the Food Distribution reporting unit. The determination of the weighted average cost of capital incorporates current interest rates, equity risk premiums, and other market-based expectations regarding expected investment returns. The Company generally develops its forecasts based on recent sales data for existing operations and other factors. While the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different assumptions could result in different outcomes.\nAs of the date of the most recent goodwill impairment test, which utilized data and assumptions as of October 6, 2018, the Food Distribution reporting unit had a fair value that was in excess of its carrying value. The Company has sufficient available information, both current and historical, to support its assumptions, judgments and estimates used in the goodwill impairment test; however, if actual results for the Food Distribution segment are not consistent with the Company's estimates, it could result in the Company recording a non-cash impairment charge.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Other Than Goodwill\nLong-lived assets to be held and used are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When the undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to recover an asset's carrying amount, the fair value is compared to the carrying value to determine the impairment loss to be recorded. Long-lived assets are evaluated at the asset-group level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Impairments of long-lived assets were $2.6 million, $33.7 million and $15.6 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nEstimates of future cash flows and expected sales prices are judgments based upon the Company's experience and knowledge of operations. These estimates project cash flows several years into the future and are affected by changes in the economy, the competitive environment, real estate market conditions and inflation.\nLong-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell. Management determines fair values using independent appraisals, quotes or expected sales prices developed by internal real estate professionals. Estimates of expected sales prices are judgments based upon the Company's experience, knowledge of market conditions and current offers received. Changes in market conditions, the economic environment and other factors, including the Company's ability to effectively compete and react to competitor openings, can significantly impact these estimates. While the Company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable, different assumptions could result in a different outcome.\nReserves for Closed Properties\nThe Company records reserves for closed properties that are subject to long-term lease commitments based upon the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term, net of estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably expected to be obtained for the property. Future cash flows are based on contractual lease terms and knowledge of the geographic area in which the closed site is located. These estimates are subject to multiple factors, including inflation, ability to sublease the property and other economic conditions. Internally developed estimates of sublease rentals are based upon the geographic areas in which the properties are located, the results of previous efforts to sublease similar properties, and the current economic environment. Reserves may be adjusted in the future based upon the actual resolution of each of these factors At December 29, 2018, reserves for closed properties for distribution center and store lease and ancillary costs total $16.4 million. Based upon the current economic environment, the Company does not believe that it is likely to obtain any sublease rentals. A 5% increase/decrease in future estimated ancillary costs would result in a $0.4 million increase/decrease in the restructuring charge liability.\nInsurance Reserves\nSpartanNash is self-insured through self-insurance retentions or high deductible programs for workers' compensation, general liability, and automobile liability, and is also self-insured for healthcare costs. Self-insurance liabilities are recorded based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. Workers' compensation, general liability and automobile liabilities are actuarially estimated based on available historical information on an undiscounted basis. The Company has purchased stop-loss coverage to limit its exposure on a per claim basis for its self-insurance retentions and high deductible programs. On a per claim basis, the Company's exposure is up to $0.5 million for workers' compensation and general liability, $1.0 million for automobile liability, and $0.5 million for healthcare per covered life per year. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to self-insurance reserves.\nAny projection of losses concerning insurance reserves is subject to a degree of variability. Among the causes of variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates, discount rates, litigation trends, changing regulations, legal interpretations, benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns. Although the Company's estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables, such changes could have a material impact on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities. The impact of many of these variables may be difficult to estimate.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nAccounting for defined benefit plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future, based on vested years of service, and attributing those costs over the time period each associate works. The significant factors affecting the Company's pension costs are the fair values of plan assets and the selections of management's key assumptions, including the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used by the Company's actuary to calculate its liability. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in interest rates and investment returns, in selecting these assumptions. The discount rate is based on current investment yields on high quality fixed-income investments and projected cash flow obligations. Expected return on plan assets is based on projected returns by asset class on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices, as well as the Company's target asset allocation, which is designed to meet the Company's long-term pension requirements. While the Company believes the assumptions selected are reasonable, significant differences in its actual experience, plan amendments or significant changes in the fair value of its plan assets may materially affect its pension obligations and its future expense.\nSensitivities to changes in the major assumptions for the SpartanNash Company Pension Plan and the SpartanNash Company Retiree Medical Plan as of December 29, 2018, are as follows:\n\nRefer to Note 11, Associate Retirement Plans, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the assumptions used to estimate the cost of benefits and for details related to changes in the funded status of the defined benefit pension plans.\nIncome Taxes\nSpartanNash is subject to periodic audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other state and local taxing authorities. These audits may challenge certain of the Company's tax positions, such as the timing and amount of income credits and deductions and the allocation of taxable income to various tax jurisdictions. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. These tax uncertainties are reviewed as facts and circumstances change and are adjusted accordingly. This requires significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the Company's effective income tax rate and cash flows in future years. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which it expects the differences to reverse. Refer to Note 13, Income Tax, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flow Information\nThe following table summarizes the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows for 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased for 2018 compared to 2017 by approximately $118.8 million primarily due to lower working capital requirements, particularly inventory and accounts receivable, compared to the prior year.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased for 2017 versus 2016 by approximately $104.3 million. The change was primarily due to the timing of working capital requirements, particularly higher accounts receivable and inventory balances associated with new distribution business and incremental sales to certain high-growth distribution customers. The timing of year-end payments impacting accounts payable balances also contributed to the change in cash flows, which was partly offset by lower customer advances compared to the 2016.\nDuring 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company made $0.1 million, $10.7 million and $35.8 million, respectively, in net income tax payments.\nNet cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $251.2 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the Caito and BRT acquisition made in the prior year.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $247.2 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the Caito and BRT acquisition made in 2017\nThe Food Distribution, Military and Retail segments utilized 46.6%, 4.9% and 48.5% of capital expenditures, respectively, for 2018. Expenditures for 2018 primarily related to retail store remodels and upgrades, which include five store remodels, various equipment purchases, and IT system upgrades and implementations to better streamline processes and meet the operational and supply chain needs of the Company. The Company expects capital expenditures to range from $85.0 million to $93.0 million for 2019.\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities increased $358.3 million during 2018 over 2017 primarily due to borrowings on the revolving credit facility in the prior year to fund the acquisition and working capital, as well as increases in cash provided by operating activities which were used to pay down debt in the current year.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $340.6 million during 2017 over 2016 primarily due to borrowings on the revolving credit facility to fund the Caito and BRT acquisition and timing of working capital requirements, partially offset by a $26.0 million increase in cash used for the repurchase of common stock.\nNet cash used in discontinued operations. Net cash used in discontinued operations contains the net cash flows of the Company's Food Distribution and Retail discontinued operations and is primarily composed of facility maintenance expenditures.\nDebt Management\nTotal debt, including capital lease obligations and current maturities, decreased $51.9 million to $698.1 million as of December 29, 2018 from $750.0 million at December 30, 2017. The decrease in total debt was driven by principal payments in the current year due to an increase in cash provided by operations.\nIn December 2018, SpartanNash Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to the Company's Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The principal changes of the amendment included an extension of the maturity date of the loans from December 20, 2021 to December 18, 2023, the ability to increase the size of the Tranche A revolving loan to $975 million from $900 million, an amendment to the interest rate grid such that rates for the Tranche A-1 revolving loans are now LIBOR plus 2.25% to LIBOR plus 2.50%, a reload of the $60 million Tranche A-2 term loan and a reset of certain advance rates for the borrowing base. The Credit Agreement provides for borrowings of $1.1 billion, consisting of three tranches: a $975 million secured revolving credit facility (Tranche A), a $40 million secured revolving credit facility (Tranche A-1), and a $60 million term loan (Tranche A-2). The Company has the ability to increase the size of the Credit Agreement by an additional $325 million, subject to certain conditions in the Credit Agreement. The Company's obligations under the related Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company's personal and real property. The Company may repay all loans in whole or in part at any time without penalty.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and its senior secured credit facility. As of December 29, 2018, the senior secured credit facility had outstanding borrowings of $660.9 million. Additional available borrowings under the Company's $1.1 billion Credit Agreement are based on stipulated advance rates on eligible assets, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintains Excess Availability of 10% of the borrowing base, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company had excess availability after the 10% requirement of $262.0 million at December 29, 2018. Payment of dividends and repurchases of outstanding shares are permitted, provided that certain levels of excess availability are maintained. The credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit, of which $11.7 million were outstanding as of December 29, 2018. The revolving credit facility matures December 18, 2023 and is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets. The Company believes that cash generated from operating activities and available borrowings under the Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, and debt service obligations for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that the business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that the Company will maintain its ability to borrow under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Company's current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) was 2.10:1 at December 29, 2018 compared to 2.03:1 at December 30, 2017, and its investment in working capital was $524.6 million at December 29, 2018 compared to $509.7 million at December 30, 2017. Net debt to total capital ratio decreased to 0.49:1 at December 29, 2018 from 0.50:1 at December 30, 2017. Total net debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as long-term debt and capital lease obligations, plus current maturities of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, less cash and cash equivalents. The Company believes both management and its investors find the information useful because it reflects the amount of long-term debt obligations that are not covered by available cash and temporary investments. Total net debt is not a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may differ from similarly titled measures of other companies.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of long-term debt and capital lease obligations to total net long-term debt and capital lease obligations as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017.\n\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below presents the Company's significant contractual obligations as of December 29, 2018 (a):\n\n (a) Excludes funding of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The Company expects to make contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2019, as necessary, to fund the distributions in connection with the termination of the Plan described within Note 11, Associate Retirement Plans. Also excludes contributions under various multi-employer pension and health and welfare plans, which totals $13.3 million and $13.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 29, 2018. For additional information, refer to Note 11, Associate Retirement Plans, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Also excludes unrecognized tax liabilities, as the Company cannot reasonably estimate the timing of potential cash settlement. For additional information, refer to Note 13, Income Tax, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n (b) Refer to Note 7, Long-Term Debt, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. \n (c) Operating and capital lease obligations do not include common area maintenance, insurance or tax payments for which the Company is also obligated. These costs totaled approximately $15.4 million in 2018. \n (d) The amount of purchase obligations shown in this table represents the amount of product the Company is contractually obligated to purchase in order to earn $11.8 million in advanced contract monies that are receivable under the contracts. At December 29, 2018, $3.0 million in advanced contract monies has been received under these contracts where recognition has been deferred on the consolidated balance sheet. If the Company does not fulfill these purchase obligations, it would only be obligated to repay the unearned upfront contract monies. The amount shown here does not include the following: a) purchase obligations made in the normal course of business as those obligations involve purchase orders based on current Company needs that are typically cancelable and/or fulfilled by vendors within a very short period of time; b) agreements that are cancelable by the Company without significant penalty, including contracts for routine outsourced services; and c) contracts that do not contain minimum annual purchase commitments but include other standard contractual considerations that must be fulfilled in order to earn advanced contract monies that have been received. \nThe Company has also made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond December 29, 2018. These commitments include standby letters of credit and guarantees of certain Food Distribution customer lease obligations. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, and Note 15, Concentration of Credit Risk, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding lease guarantees and assigned leases. The following summarizes these commitments as of December 29, 2018:\n\n (a) Letters of credit primarily support the Company's self-insurance obligations. \nCash Dividends\nThe Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18, $0.165 and $0.15 per common share in each quarter of 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is generally permitted to pay dividends in any year up to an amount such that all cash dividends, together with any cash distributions and share repurchases, do not exceed $35.0 million. Additionally, the Company is generally permitted to pay cash dividends in excess of $35.0 million in any year so long as its Excess Availability, as defined in the Credit Agreement, is in excess of 10% of the Total Borrowing Base, as defined in the Credit Agreement, before and after giving effect to the repurchases and dividends. Although the Company currently expects to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend, adoption of a dividend policy does not commit the Board of Directors (the Board\u201d) to declare future dividends. Each future dividend will be considered and declared by the Board at its discretion. Whether the Board continues to declare dividends depends on a number of factors, including the Company's future financial condition, anticipated profitability and cash flows and compliance with the terms of its credit facilities.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to recently adopted accounting standards, as well as the anticipated effect of any impending accounting standards.", "item_7_tables": "Table 55:

Results of Operations (MD&A) for SpartanNash. SpartanNash is a grocery distributor and retailer headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan, operating through three business segments: Food Distribution, Military, and Retail.\n\nIn 2018, SpartanNash expanded its supply chain capabilities, improved delivery efficiency, invested in its labor force, diverged redundant operations, and won recognition for innovation in marketing and merchandising. The Food Distribution segment displayed sales growth due to new customer programs and marked the 12th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth. The Military segment supported DeCA in expanding its private brand program, leading to sales growth, and responded to urgent requests during Hurricane Florence. The Retail segment invested in store remodels for brand repositioning and expanded their e-commerce solution, Fast Lane, in addition to piloting a mobile application for in-store scanning and bagging.\n\nThe fiscal year end is on the Saturday closest to December 31. The company reported net sales increases across its Food Distribution and Military segments, partially offset by decreased Retail net sales. Gross profit decreased compared to the prior year, while Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased slightly.\n\nCash provided by operating activities increased significantly in 2018 compared to 2017, mainly due to lower working capital requirements. Investing activities decreased mainly due to the prior year acquisition of Caito and BRT. Financing activities in 2018 saw a large increase in cash used due to debt repayment.\n\nSpartanNash management believes that they have enough liquidity to cover working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, and debt servicing for the foreseeable future.\n\nCertain critical accounting policies and estimates, including inventory valuations, vendor funds, allowances and credits, customer credit risk, business combinations, goodwill, impairment of long-lived assets, reserves for closed properties, insurance reserves, defined benefit plans, and income taxes, involve a high degree of judgment and complexity.\n\nIn terms of recent accounting standards adopted, readers are referred to Note 1 for additional details and anticipated effects on financial reports.\n\nThe company ended the year with a net increase in cash and cash equivalents and paid quarterly cash dividends throughout the year. Future dividends will be considered by the Board based on multiple factors, including financial condition and anticipated cash flows."}
