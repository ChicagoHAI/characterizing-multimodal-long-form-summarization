Subsequent to the closing of the IPO, the underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option and purchased 5,294,358 additional common units at $18.00 per unit. A total of 47,794,358 common units were issued to the public unitholders in connection with the IPO. A registration statement on Form S-1, as amended through the time of its effectiveness, was filed by the Partnership with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and was declared effective on October 25, 2017.

Our assets consist of interests in entities that own crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent pipelines serving as key infrastructure for BP and other customers to transport onshore crude oil production to BP's crude oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana (the Whiting Refinery\u201d) and offshore crude oil and natural gas production to key refining markets and trading and distribution hubs. Certain of our assets deliver refined products and diluent from the Whiting Refinery and other U.S. supply hubs to major demand centers.\nOur assets consist of the following:\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>BP2 OpCo, which owns the BP#2 crude oil pipeline system ( BP2\u201d) consisting of approximately 12 miles of pipeline and related assets that transport crude oil from Griffith Station, Indiana, to the Whiting Refinery.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>River Rouge OpCo, which owns the Whiting to River Rouge refined products pipeline system ( River Rouge\u201d) consisting of approximately 244 miles of pipeline and related assets that transport refined petroleum products from the Whiting Refinery to the refined products terminal at River Rouge, Michigan.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Diamondback OpCo, which owns the Diamondback diluent pipeline system ( Diamondback\u201d) consisting of approximately 42 miles of pipeline and related assets that transport diluent from Black Oak Junction, Indiana, to a third-party owned pipeline in Manhattan, Illinois.

( BP Products\u201d), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BP, for transporting diluent on the Diamondback pipeline under a joint tariff agreement with a third-party carrier. This agreement contains a minimum volume requirement, under which BP Products has committed to pay us an incentive rate for a fixed minimum volume during the twelve-month running period from July 1, 2017 and each successive twelve-month period thereafter through June 30, 2020, whether or not such volumes are physically shipped through Diamondback.\nEffective upon the completion of the IPO, we entered into additional throughput and deficiency agreements with BP Products for each of our three wholly owned pipeline systems at BP2, River Rouge and Diamondback. Under these fee-based agreements, we provide transportation services to BP Products, in exchange for BP Products' commitment to pay us the applicable tariff rates for the minimum monthly volumes, whether or not such volumes are physically shipped by BP Products through our pipelines. BP Products is allowed to make up for the monthly deficiency within the same calendar year during the initial term ending December 31, 2020. Adjustment to the monthly deficiency payments remitted to us by BP Products, if any, is determined at the end of each calendar year based on the actual volume transported during such period.\nOffshore Assets\nMany of the contracts supporting our offshore assets include fee-based life-of-lease transportation dedications and require producers to transport all production from the specified fields connected to the pipeline for the life of the related oil lease without a minimum volume commitment. This agreement structure means that the dedicated production cannot be transported by any other\nmeans, such as barges or another pipeline. The Mars system has a combination of FERC-regulated tariff rates, intrastate rates, and contractual rates that apply to throughput movements and inventory management fees for excess inventory, and certain of those rates may be indexed with the FERC rate. Two of the Mars agreements also include provisions to guarantee a return to the pipeline to enable the pipeline to recover its investment, despite the uncertainty in production volumes, by providing for an annual transportation rate adjustment over a fixed period of time to achieve a fixed rate of return. The calculation for the fixed rate of return is based on actual project costs and operating costs. At the end of the fixed period, the rate will be locked in at a rate no greater than the last calculated rate and adjusted annually thereafter at a rate no less than zero percent and no greater than the FERC index.\nThe Proteus and Caesar pipelines have an order from the FERC declaring them to be contract carriers with negotiated rates and services. On Proteus and Caesar, the fees for the anchor shippers, which account for a majority of the volumes dedicated to Proteus and Caesar, respectively, were set for the life of the lease over the original lease volumes dedicated to Proteus and Caesar, and are not subject to annual escalation under their oil transportation contracts. The shippers have firm space that varies annually corresponding to their requested maximum daily quantity forecasts. The majority of our revenues on these pipelines are generated by our anchor shippers based on the specified fee for all transported volumes covered by oil transportation contracts with each shipper. Contracts entered into in connection with later connections to Proteus and Caesar may have different terms than the anchor shippers, including rates that vary with inflation.\nCleopatra is also a contract carrier. Each shipper on Cleopatra has a contract with negotiated rates. The rates are fixed for the anchor shippers' dedicated leases, are not subject to annual escalation and generate the majority of Cleopatra's revenues. Contracts for field connections for other shippers contain a variety of rate structures.\nEndymion is currently a contract carrier. However, it could be subject to intrastate or FERC jurisdiction under certain circumstances in the future. Endymion generates the majority of its revenues from contractual fees applied to the transportation of oil into storage and from fees applied to per barrel movements of oil out of storage (including volume incentive discounts for larger shippers using storage). The rates are fixed for the anchor shippers' agreements, are not subject to annual escalation and generate the majority of Endymion's revenues. Agreements for other shippers may have different terms than the anchor shippers, including rates that may vary with inflation.\nFixed Loss Allowance and Inventory Management Fees\nThe tariffs applicable to BP2 and Mars include a fixed loss allowance ( FLA\u201d). An FLA factor per barrel, a fixed percentage, is a separate fee under the crude oil tariffs to cover evaporation and other loss in transit. As crude oil is transported, we earn additional income based on the applicable FLA factor and the volume transported by the customer and the applicable prices. Under the tariff applicable to BP2 and Mars, allowance oil related revenue is recognized using the average market price for the relevant type of crude oil during the month the product is transported.\nIn addition, we are entitled to inventory management fees for Louisiana offshore oil port storage used by Endymion and Mars.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include: (i) safety and environmental metrics, (ii) revenue (including FLA) from throughput and utilization; (iii) operating expenses and maintenance spend; (iv) Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below); and (v) cash available for distribution.\nPreventative Safety and Environmental Metrics\nWe are committed to maintaining and improving the safety, reliability and efficiency of our operations. We have implemented reporting programs requiring all employees and contractors of our Parent who provide services to us to record environmental and safety-related incidents. Our management team uses these existing programs and data to evaluate trends and potential interventions to deliver on performance targets. We integrate health, occupational safety, process safety and environmental principles throughout our operations in order to reduce and eliminate environmental and safety-related incidents.\nThroughput\nThe amount of revenue our business generates primarily depends on our fee-based transportation agreements with shippers, our tariffs and the volumes of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent that we handle on our pipelines.\nThe volumes that we handle on our pipelines are primarily affected by the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. Our results of operations are impacted by our ability to:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>utilize any remaining unused capacity on, or add additional capacity to, our pipeline systems;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increase throughput volumes on our pipeline systems by making connections to existing or new third-party pipelines or other facilities, primarily driven by the anticipated supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>identify and execute organic expansion projects; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increase throughput volumes via acquisitions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Expenses and Total Maintenance Spend\nOperating Expenses\nOur management seeks to maximize our profitability by effectively managing our operating expenses. These expenses are comprised primarily of labor expenses (including contractor services), general materials, supplies, minor maintenance, utility costs (including electricity and fuel) and insurance premiums. Utility costs fluctuate based on throughput volumes and the grades of crude oil and types of refined products we handle. Our other operating expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes, but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period.\nTotal Maintenance Spend\nWe calculate Total Maintenance Spend as the sum of maintenance expenses and maintenance capital expenditures, excluding any reimbursable maintenance capital expenditures. We track these expenses on a combined basis because it is useful to understanding our total maintenance requirements. Total Maintenance Spend for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, is shown in the table below:\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands of dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholly Owned Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital expenditures\n</td> <td>2,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Wholly Owned Assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mars and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital expenditures\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Mars and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Maintenance Spend\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>* Information is not applicable for the periods prior to the IPO.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Reflects the allocable portion of the maintenance expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and Total Maintenance Spend, as applicable, attributable to our 28.5% ownership interest in Mars and our 20% interest of the 56% ownership interest in Caesar, 53% interest in Cleopatra, 65% interest in Proteus and 65% interest in Endymion held by Mardi Gras. The maintenance expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and Total Maintenance Spend for Mars and each Mardi Gras Joint Ventures is shown for the post-IPO period from October 30, 2017 to December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe seek to maximize our profitability by effectively managing our maintenance expenses, which consist primarily of safety and environmental integrity programs. We seek to manage our maintenance expenses on the pipelines we operate by scheduling maintenance over time to avoid significant variability in our maintenance expenses and minimize their impact on our cash flows, without compromising our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship.\nOur maintenance expenses represent the costs we incur that do not significantly extend the useful life or increase the expected output of our property, plant and equipment. These expenses include pipeline repairs, replacements of immaterial sections of pipelines, inspections, equipment rentals and costs incurred to maintain compliance with existing safety and environmental\nstandards, irrespective of the magnitude of such compliance expenses. Our maintenance expenses vary significantly from period to period because certain of our expenses are the result of scheduled safety and environmental integrity programs, which occur on a multi-year cycle and require substantial outlays.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income taxes, gain or loss from disposition of property, plant and equipment, and depreciation and amortization, plus cash distributed to the Partnership from equity method investments for the applicable period, less income from equity method investments. We define Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership as Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. We present these financial measures because we believe replacing our proportionate share of our equity method investments' net income with the cash received from such equity method investments more accurately reflects the cash flow from our business, which is meaningful to our investors.\nWe compute and present cash available for distribution and define it as Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership less maintenance capital expenditures attributable to the Partnership, net interest paid/received, cash reserves, income taxes paid and net adjustments from volume deficiency payments attributable to the Partnership. Cash available for distribution does not reflect changes in working capital balances.\nAdjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution are non-GAAP (\"GAAP\" refers to United States generally accepted accounting principles) supplemental financial measures, which are metrics that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution are net income and net cash provided by operating activities, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities.\nAdjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or cash available for distribution in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. Please read Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d section below for the reconciliation of net income and cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results\nOur results of operations subsequent to the IPO are not comparable to our Predecessor's historical results of operations for the reasons described below:\nRevenues\nPrior to July 1, 2017, our Predecessor did not have agreements that contained minimum volume commitments. As of July 1, 2017, we entered into a throughput and deficiency agreement with BP Products for transporting diluent on Diamondback under a joint tariff agreement with a third-party carrier that contains minimum volume requirements. In connection with the IPO, we entered into additional throughput and deficiency agreements that contain minimum volume requirements with BP Products for each of our three Wholly Owned Assets. See Note 8 - Related Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details.\nContribution of Interests in Investments\nImmediately prior to the consummation of the IPO, BP Pipelines contributed to us 28.5% ownership interest in Mars and 20% managing member interest in Mardi Gras. We control and consolidate Mardi Gras via an agreement between us and our Parent, under which we have the right to vote 100% of Mardi Gras' ownership interests in each of the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures. Historical Predecessor results of operations consist of only the Predecessor Assets.\nExpenses\nOur Predecessor's operating and general and administrative expenses included direct charges for the management and operations of our assets and certain general corporate overhead, shared services and operating services allocated to us by BP Pipelines through October 29, 2017. These allocated expenses included but were not limited to finance, accounting, treasury, legal, information technology, human resources, shared services, government affairs, insurance, health, safety, security, employee benefits, incentives, severance and environmental functional support. These expenses were charged or allocated to our Predecessor Assets based on the nature of the expenses.\nSubsequent to the IPO, BP Pipelines charges us a combination of fixed and reimbursable charges for administrative and operating services under our omnibus agreement. We pay an annual fee, initially $13.3 million, to BP Pipelines for general and administrative services. The omnibus fee is structured to support all of our onshore and offshore assets, while the expenses allocated to the Predecessor only covered the Wholly Owned Assets.\nWe have begun incurring incremental general and administrative expenses attributable to being a publicly traded partnership. Such expenses include but are not limited to expenses associated with periodic reporting with the SEC, tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, NYSE listing, independent auditor fees, legal fees, investor relations expenses, transfer agent and registrar fees, outside director fees and compensation expense associated with the long-term incentive plan.\nIncome Taxes\nFederal income taxes were reflected on the historical financial statements of our Predecessor. The Partnership is a pass-through entity for federal and state income tax purposes and is not subject to federal and state income tax expense in its financial results.\nFinancing\nThere are differences in the way we finance our operations as compared to the way our Predecessor historically financed its operations. Historically, our Predecessor's operations were financed as part of BP Pipelines' integrated operations, and our Predecessor did not record any separate costs associated with financing its operations. Our Predecessor largely relied on internally-generated cash flows and capital contributions from BP Pipelines to satisfy its capital expenditure requirements. Subsequent to the IPO, we expect to fund future capital expenditures primarily from external sources, including borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility and potential future issuances of equity and debt securities.\nWe intend to make cash distributions to our unitholders at a minimum distribution rate of $0.2625 per unit per quarter ($1.05 per unit on an annualized basis). Based on the terms of our cash distribution policy, we expect that we will distribute to our unitholders and our general partner, as the holder of our incentive distribution rights, most of the cash generated by our operations.\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nOur business can be negatively affected by sustained downturns or slow growth in the economy in general, and is impacted by shifts in supply and demand dynamics, the mix of services requested by the customers of our pipelines, competition and changes in regulatory requirements affecting our customers' operations.\nWe believe the key factors that impact our business are the supply of and/or demand for crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent in the markets in which our business operates.\nWe also believe that our customers' requirements and government regulation of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent pipeline systems, discussed in more detail below, play an important role in how we manage our operations and implement our long-term strategies.\nChanges in Crude Oil and Natural Gas Sourcing and Refined Product and Diluent Demand Dynamics\nTo effectively manage our business, we monitor our market areas for both short-term and long-term shifts in crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent supply and demand. Changes in crude oil and natural gas supply such as new discoveries of reserves, declining production in older fields and the introduction of new sources of crude oil and natural gas supply, investment programs of our shippers to maintain or increase production, along with global supply and demand fundamentals such as the strength of the U.S. dollar, weather conditions and competition among oil producing countries for market share, affect the demand for our services from both producers and consumers. One of the strategic advantages of our crude oil pipeline system is its ability to transport attractively priced crude oil from multiple supply sources. Our crude oil shippers periodically change the relative mix of crude oil grades delivered to the refineries and markets served by our pipelines. While these changes in the sourcing patterns of crude oil transported are reflected in changes in the relative volumes of crude oil by type handled by our pipelines, our crude oil transportation revenue is primarily affected by changes in overall crude oil supply and demand dynamics.\nSimilarly, our refined products pipeline system has the ability to serve multiple demand centers. Our refined products shippers periodically change the relative mix of refined products shipped on our refined products pipeline system, as well as the destination points, based on changes in pricing and demand dynamics. While these changes in shipping patterns are reflected in relative types of refined products handled by our pipeline, our total product transportation revenue is primarily affected by changes in overall refined products and diluent supply and demand dynamics.\nFurther, the volumes of crude oil that we transport on our BP2 system and refined products and diluent that we distribute on our River Rouge and Diamondback systems depend substantially on the economics of available crude supply for the Whiting Refinery and the economics for refined products and diluent demand in the markets that the pipelines serve. These economics are affected by numerous factors beyond our control.\nAs these supply and demand dynamics shift, we anticipate that we will continue to actively pursue projects that link new sources of supply to producers and consumers. Similarly, as demand dynamics change, we anticipate that we will create new services or capacity arrangements that meet customer requirements.\nChanges in Commodity Prices\nWe do not engage in the marketing and trading of any commodities. We do not take ownership of crude oil, natural gas, refined products or diluent. As a result, our exposure to commodity price fluctuations is limited to the FLA provisions in our tariffs, which are only applicable to our crude oil pipelines. We also have indirect exposure to commodity price fluctuations to the extent such fluctuations affect the shipping patterns of our customers.\nMajor Expansion Projects\nWe currently have one major expansion project planned in 2018. An affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell plc (\"Shell\") is currently building the Mattox pipeline, which will connect to Proteus for the mutual benefit of all parties involved. Through this upstream connection, Proteus will transport all of the volumes from Shell's recently sanctioned Appomattox platform. Proteus is also constructing a new connecting platform adjacent to South Pass 89E platform that will accommodate volumes from the Mattox pipeline. In addition, the new Proteus platform will provide space for future pumping equipment and the ability to increase the capacity of the Proteus system to over 700 kbpd.\nThe total project cost is expected to be approximately $345.0 million from 2015 to 2019, which are fully reimbursable to Proteus from third-party investors that are not affiliated with the Partnership. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Proteus incurred $147.3 million of capitalized costs. We expect the Appomattox expansion capital expenditures to be approximately $119.8 million in 2018.\nCustomers\nBP is our primary customer. Transportation revenue from BP represented 97.6%, 94.4%, and 93.8% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. BP's volumes represented approximately 97.4%, 95.2% and 95.3% of the aggregate total volumes transported on the Wholly Owned Assets for the period from January 1, 2017 through October 29, 2017, and the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. BP's volumes represented approximately 54.5% of the aggregate total volumes transported on the Wholly Owned Assets, Mars and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures combined for the period from October 30, 2017 through December 31, 2017.\nIn addition, we transport crude oil, natural gas and diluent for a mix of third-party customers, including crude oil producers, refiners, marketers and traders, and our assets are connected to other crude oil, natural gas and diluent pipeline systems. In addition to serving directly connected Midwestern U.S. and Gulf Coast markets, our pipelines have access to customers in various regions of the United States and Canada through interconnections with other major pipelines. Our customers use our transportation services for a variety of reasons. Producers of crude oil require the ability to deliver their product to market and frequently enter into firm transportation contracts to ensure that they will have sufficient capacity available to deliver their product to delivery points with greatest market liquidity. Marketers and traders generate income from buying and selling crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent to capitalize on price differentials over time or between markets. Our customer mix can vary over time and largely depends on the crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent supply and demand dynamics in our markets.\nCompetition\nOur pipelines face competition from a variety of alternative transportation methods including rail, water borne movements including barging and shipping, trucking and other pipelines that service the same markets as our pipelines. Competition for BP2 and River Rouge common carrier pipelines is based primarily on connectivity to sources of supply and demand, while Diamondback faces competition for Gulf Coast sourced diluent from third-party pipelines, which have made direct connections at Manhattan, Illinois. Our offshore pipelines compete for new production on the basis of geographic proximity to the production, cost of connection, available capacity, transportation rates and access to onshore markets.\nRegulation\nOur interstate common carrier pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies including the FERC, Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and the Department of Transportation (\"DOT\"). For more information on federal, state and local regulations affecting our business, please read Part I, Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties within this report.\nAcquisition Opportunities\nWe plan to pursue acquisitions of complementary assets from BP as well as third parties. We also may pursue acquisitions jointly with BP Pipelines. BP Pipelines has granted us a right of first offer with respect to its retained ownership interest in Mardi Gras and all of its interests in midstream pipeline systems and assets related thereto in the contiguous United States and offshore Gulf of Mexico that were owned by BP Pipelines at the closing of the IPO. Neither BP nor any of its affiliates are under any obligation, however, to sell or offer to sell us additional assets or to pursue acquisitions jointly with us, and we are under no obligation to buy any additional assets from them or to pursue any joint acquisitions with them. We will focus our acquisition strategy on transportation and midstream assets within the crude oil, natural gas and refined products sectors. We believe that we are well positioned to acquire midstream assets from BP, and particularly BP Pipelines, as well as third parties, should such opportunities arise. Identifying and executing acquisitions will be a key part of our strategy. However, if we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth will be limited, and the acquisitions we do make may reduce, rather than increase, our available cash.\nSeasonality\nThe volumes of crude oil, refined products and diluent transported in our pipelines are directly affected by the level of supply and demand for such commodities in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. However, many effects of seasonality on our revenue will be substantially mitigated through the use of our fee-based long-term agreements with BP Products that include minimum volume commitments.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables and discussion contain a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. For periods prior the closing of our IPO, all financial data included in this section of the report reflect the results of our Predecessor for accounting purposes. For the period subsequent to the closing of the IPO (i.e., October 30, 2017 through December 31, 2017), the financial data reflect the results of the Partnership.\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td>

The increase in throughput volume at BP2 during the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to a lower level of maintenance activities performed on Whiting Refinery equipment during this period, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The overall increase in revenue was partially offset by (i) a $7.5 million decrease in throughput revenue at Diamondback due to a 31.9% reduction in throughput volume primarily driven by lower Whiting Refinery diluent production, (ii) a $0.6 million decrease in throughput revenue at River Rouge, and (iii) a $0.6 million decrease in revenue from reimbursable projects at BP2.\nOperating expenses increased by $2.0 million, or 14.3%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to (i) a $1.1 million increase in insurance expense caused by a higher internal allocation from the Parent prior to the IPO in 2017 compared with 2016 and a higher insurance premium covering the Wholly Owned Assets, Mars, and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures subsequent to the IPO, and (ii) a $0.8 million increase in electricity expense results from an increase in throughput volumes at BP2 and higher electrical usage due to pump and motor constraints at River Rouge during 2017.\nMaintenance expenses increased by $2.0 million, or 67.9%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of increased maintenance project activities primarily related to River Rouge, including in-line inspections and repairs emanating from the in-line inspections. In-line inspections started in the fourth quarter of 2016 and incurred cost of $2.7 million in 2017. This increase was partially offset by the costs incurred by the River Rouge projects completed in 2016, such as casing test station installations at fourteen sites and cathodic protection maintenance required from the annual survey, which incurred total project costs of $0.8 million in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $0.6 million, or 7.3%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Prior to the IPO, general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of expenses allocated\nfrom the Parent. Subsequent to the IPO, general and administrative expenses primary consist of a fixed fee of $13.3 million per year under an omnibus agreement that we entered into with our Parent in connection with the IPO and additional costs incurred as a result of being a publicly traded partnership.\nDepreciation expense remained relatively flat at $2.7 million and $2.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nProperty and other tax expense remained flat at $0.4 million in both of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nIncome from equity method investments was $17.9 million in 2017 due to earnings from Mars and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures from October 30, 2017 through December 31, 2017, after they were contributed to us in connection with the IPO.\nOther income was less than $0.1 million and $0.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Other income represents the changes in fair value of the embedded derivative associated with the allowance oil receivable incurred prior to October 1, 2017. Pursuant to a related party agreement, allowance oil receivable incurred on and after October 1, 2017 is settled at the commodity prices of the movement month and no longer contains an embedded derivative that would result in gain and losses due to changes in fair value.\nInterest expense, net was $0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. In connection with the IPO, we entered into a $600.0 million revolving credit facility agreement. The $0.1 million of net interest consisted of interest expense and commitment and utilization fees, which were partially offset by interest income on cash deposits held by BPMP.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $4.1 million, or 14.1%, due to a change in tax status upon completion of the IPO. Prior to the IPO, the Predecessor was included in the consolidated income tax returns of our Parent which is subject to federal and state income taxes. The effective tax rate during the period ended October 29, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016, remained consistent at 39.1%. Subsequent to the IPO, the Partnership is treated as a pass-through entity for federal and state income tax purposes. There is no federal and state income taxes for the period subsequent the IPO.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nTotal revenue decreased by $3.8 million, or 3.5%, primarily due to activity from our BP2 pipeline, including a $4.6 million reduction from volumes and a $1.8 million decrease in FLA revenue in 2016 that were partially offset by a 1.3% increase in BP2's average pipeline tariff. Throughput volumes for BP2 decreased by 10.1%, primarily because the Whiting Refinery completed a significant scheduled turnaround, which occurred periodically, in 2016. The revenue decrease was partially offset by a $1.9 million revenue increase from Diamondback due to a 0.8% throughput volumes increase and by a $0.7 million revenue increase in River Rouge due a 2.2% average tariff increase.\nOperating expenses decreased in 2016 by $0.3 million, or 2.2%, primarily as a result of a reduction of insurance costs of $1.7 million and lower variable power costs of $0.3 million partially offset by increased environmental remediation accrual costs of $1.3 million, increased chemical costs of $0.3 million and an increase in other costs of $0.1 million. Insurance costs decreased due to a restructuring of the insurance program and the rates charged by insurers. Power costs decreased due to decreased throughput volume, in addition to drag reducing agents (\"DRA\") being added to River Rouge. The environmental remediation accrual costs increased due to a revision in our environmental liabilities. The increased chemical costs resulted from the cost to purchase the DRA for River Rouge.\nMaintenance expenses decreased in 2016 by $0.9 million, or 23.8%, as a result of decreased project costs. Project costs decreased primarily due to the completion of larger projects during 2015, including relocating a portion of River Rouge to maintain right of way status and the completion of a potential leak investigation.\nGeneral and administrative expense remained relatively flat year over year. General and administrative expenses consisted of expenses allocated by our Parent.\nDepreciation expense was $2.6 million in 2016 as compared with $2.5 million in 2015.\nProperty and other tax expense remained relatively flat year over year.\nOther income (loss) was $0.5 million and $(0.6) million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other income (loss) represented the changes in fair value in earnings related to the embedded derivative within the allowance oil receivable.\nIncome tax expense remained relatively flat year over year.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income and to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods indicated.\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands of dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution to Net Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>2,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain from disposition of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>25,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions received from equity method investments -

Prior to the IPO, we participated in BP Pipelines' centralized cash management system; therefore, our cash receipts were deposited in BP Pipelines' or its affiliates' bank accounts, all cash disbursements were made from those accounts, and we maintained no bank accounts dedicated solely to our assets. Thus, historically our financial statements have reflected no cash balances prior to the IPO.\nFollowing the IPO, we maintain separate bank accounts, and BP Pipelines continues to provide treasury services on our General Partner's behalf under our omnibus agreement. We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations (including distribution from our equity method investments), borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of debt and additional equity securities. The entities in which we own an interest may also incur debt. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term working capital requirements and long-term capital expenditure requirements and to make quarterly cash distributions.\nThe board of directors of our general partner has adopted a cash distribution policy pursuant to which we intend to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2625 per unit per quarter, which equates to approximately $27.5 million per quarter, or approximately $110.0 million per year in the aggregate, based on the number of common and subordinated units currently outstanding. We intend to pay such distributions to the extent we have sufficient cash after the establishment of cash reserves and the payment of our expenses, including payments to our general partner and its affiliates.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn October 30, 2017, the Partnership entered into a $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the credit facility\u201d) with an affiliate of BP. The credit facility terminates on October 30, 2022 and provides for certain covenants, including the requirement to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio, which is calculated as total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit facility), not to exceed 5.0 to 1.0, subject to a temporary increase in such ratio to 5.5 to 1.0 in connection with certain material acquisitions. In addition, the limited liability company agreement of our General Partner requires the approval of BP Holdco prior to the incurrence of any indebtedness that would cause our leverage ratio to exceed 4.5 to 1.0.\nThe credit facility also contains customary events of default, such as (i) nonpayment of principal when due, (ii) nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts, (iii) breach of covenants, (iv) misrepresentation, (v) cross-payment default and cross-acceleration (in each case, to indebtedness in excess of $75.0 million) and (vi) insolvency. Additionally, the credit facility limits our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional debt, (ii) redeem or repurchase units or make distributions under certain circumstances; and (iii) incur certain liens or permit them to exist. Indebtedness under this facility bears interest at the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") plus 0.85%. This facility includes customary fees, including a commitment fee of 0.10% and a utilization fee of 0.20%. At December 31, 2017, $15.0 million was drawn and outstanding from the credit facility.\nCash Flows from Our Operations\nOperating Activities. We generated $69.2 million in cash flow from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the $49.8 million generated in the year ended December 31, 2016. The $19.4 million increase in cash flows from operations primarily resulted from an increase in net income attributed to the Wholly Owned Assets and the distributions from equity method investments that were contributed to us in connection with the IPO. The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities position primarily in accounts receivable from related parties.\nOur Predecessor generated $49.8 million in cash flow from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $48.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to a change in accounts receivable position from both third and related parties in addition to an increase in accounts payable to third parties partially offset by a decrease resulting from a change in the allowance oil receivable position.\nInvesting Activities. Our cash flow generated by investing activities was $5.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $3.4 million used in the year ended December 31, 2016. The $8.4 million increase in cash flow used in investing activities is due to the post-IPO distribution in excess of earnings received from equity method investments and a decrease in capital expenditures on maintenance projects during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur Predecessor's cash flow used in investing activities was $3.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $0.7 million used in the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash flow used in investing activities is due to increased cash paid for capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities. Our cash flow used in financing activities was $41.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $46.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we distributed $814.4 million of the $814.7 million net proceeds that we received from the IPO to our Parent with the remaining $0.3 million recorded in Accounts payable - related parties on the consolidated balance sheets. We also distributed $9.4 million of dividends to the prior owners of Mars and Mardi Gras, which were prorated for the fourth quarter period prior to the IPO. An additional $9.5 million was distributed to our Parent for its noncontrolling interests in Mardi Gras.\nPrior to October 30, 2017, all of our Predecessor's cash flow was advanced through BP Pipelines' centralized cash management system. Net cash used in financing activities prior to the IPO was $37.8 million for 2017, compared to $46.4 million in 2016, both of which were transfers to BP Pipelines. The use of cash in 2017 was partially offset by a $15.0 million draw from the credit facility after the IPO.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $46.4 million for 2016 compared to $47.5 million in 2015, both of which were transfers to BP Pipelines. The decrease in transfers resulted from a decrease in net income year over year.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur operations can be capital intensive, requiring investment to expand, upgrade or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. Our capital requirements consist of Maintenance Capital Expenditures and Expansion Capital Expenditures, both as defined in our partnership agreement. We are required to distinguish between Maintenance Capital\nExpenditures and Expansion Capital Expenditures in accordance with our partnership agreement, even though historically we did not make a distinction between Maintenance Capital Expenditures and Expansion Capital Expenditures in exactly the same way as is required under our partnership agreement.\nA summary of our capital expenditures, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, is shown in the table below:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands of dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash spent on maintenance capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease)/Increase in accrued capital expenditures\n</td> <td>(1,306\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>603\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures incurred\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur capital expenditures for 2017 were $1.0 million, primarily associated with the following projects:\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continuation of leak detection metering upgrades for BP2; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Replacement and installation of new transformer at Ann Arbor station for River Rouge\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur capital expenditures for 2016 were $4.0 million, primarily associated with the following projects:\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Leak detection metering upgrades for BP2;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Relief valve redesign implementation at South Bend station for River Rouge; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continuation of installation of DRA at five stations for River Rouge\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur capital expenditures for 2015 were $1.3 million, primarily associated with the following projects:\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Installation of DRA at five stations for River Rouge; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Relief valve redesign implementation at South Bend station for River Rouge\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll of our capital expenditures in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were maintenance expenditures. We did not incur any expansion capital expenditures during such periods.\nWe expect maintenance capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 million for the year ending December 31, 2018, which will primarily be related to regulatory and asset integrity projects.\nWe anticipate that our 2018 maintenance capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations and our borrowings under the credit facility.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017, is shown in the table below:\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands of dollars)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 2 to 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 4 to 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service contract\n</td> <td>212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions. We have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership and related notes thereto and believe those policies are reasonable and appropriate.\nWe apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with GAAP. Our more critical accounting policies include those related to revenue recognition, allowance oil, and environmental and legal obligations. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates. We periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are primarily generated from crude oil, refined products and diluent transportation services. In general, we recognize revenue from customers when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the price is fixed or determinable and allocated to the performance obligations in the contract; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.\nDuring the second half of 2017, we entered into multiple long-term fee-based transportation agreements with BP Products, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BP. Under these agreements, BP Products has committed to pay us the minimum volumes at the applicable rates for each of the twelve-month measurement periods specified by the applicable agreements whether or not such volumes are physically transported through our pipelines. BP Products is allowed to make up for shortfall volumes during each of the measurement periods.\nContracts with BP Products, including the allowance oil arrangements discussed below, are accounted for as separate arrangements because they do not meet the criteria for combination. We record revenue for crude oil, refined products and diluent transportation over the period in which they are earned (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place, or the services designated in the contract have been performed). Revenue from transportation services is recognized upon delivery based on contractual rates related to throughput volumes. We accrue revenue based on services rendered but not billed for that accounting month.\nBillings to BP Products for deficiency volumes under its minimum volume commitments, if any, are recorded in Accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, as BP Products has the right to make up the deficiency volumes within the measurement period specified by the agreements. The deferred balance is recognized in revenue when the make-up rights contractually expire or when the uncertainty around the possibility to make up for the shortfall diminishes, whichever is earlier.\nAllowance Oil\nOur tariff for crude oil transportation at BP2 includes an FLA. An FLA factor per barrel, a fixed percentage, is a separate fee under the applicable crude oil tariff to cover evaporation and other loss in transit. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, all of our revenue at BP2 was generated from services to our Parent.\nAs crude oil is transported, we earn additional income based on the applicable FLA factor and the volume transported by our Parent measured at the receipt location. We do not take physical possession of the allowance oil as a result of our services, but record the value of the volumes accumulated as a receivable from our Parent. We recognize the FLA income in Revenue-related parties on the consolidated statements of operations during the periods when commodities are transported. The amount of revenue recognized is a product of the quantity transported, the applicable FLA factor and the settlement price during the month the product is transported. We cash settle allowance oil receivable with our Parent in the subsequent periods after the transportation service has been performed. The settlement payment is a product of the quantity settled and the applicable settlement price per unit. Once\nthe settlement price is known, we reclassify the balance out of Allowance oil receivable and accrue it in Accounts receivable - related parties on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe settlement price for volumes accumulated prior to October 1, 2017 was a summation of the calendar-month average of West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) on the New York Mercantile Exchange and a differential provided by our Parent. The differential represents the difference in market price between WTI and the type of allowance oil to be settled and the difference in market price between the settlement month and the month prior to settlement. The fluctuation in commodity prices between the month of movement and the month of settlement resulted in an embedded derivative, which we measured along with the allowance oil receivable in their entirety at fair value because the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative were clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host arrangement. The allowance oil volumes accumulated prior to October 1, 2017 were entirely settled upon October 30, 2017. While such volumes were outstanding, we recognized the changes in their fair value in Other income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. The embedded derivative was not designated as a hedging instrument.\nThe settlement price for volumes accumulated on and after October 1, 2017 is determined using the same equation as the prior periods but with pricing input from the month of movement, instead of the month of settlement, pursuant to a related party agreement that we entered into with our affiliate. The settlement price is fixed and determinable upon the completion of transportation. As a result, the allowance oil balances at December 31, 2017 and onward no longer contain a derivative feature or result in a gain or loss related to the change in its fair value. We now settle the allowance oil at the end of each period; therefore, the balances are entirely recorded in Accounts receivable - related parties after October 1, 2017.\nLegal\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as the result of our business operations and transactions. We utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders, judgments or settlements. In general, we expense legal costs as incurred. When we identify specific litigation that is expected to continue for a significant period of time, is reasonably possible to occur and may require substantial expenditures, we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to litigate the matter to a conclusion or reach an acceptable settlement, and we accrue for the lower end of the range. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates, or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings will be affected.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws require us to take future action to remediate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemicals or petroleum substances by us or other parties. Environmental expenditures that are required to obtain future economic benefits from its assets are capitalized as part of those assets. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future earnings shall be expensed, unless already provisioned for, which then shall be charged against provisions.\nProvisions are recognized when we have a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event. It is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. We do not discount environmental liabilities, and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable, and when we can reasonably estimate the costs. In making environmental liability estimations, we consider the material effect of environmental compliance, pending legal actions against us and potential third-party liability claims. Often, as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses, additional information is obtained, requiring revisions to estimated costs. These revisions are reflected in our income in the year in which they are probable and reasonably estimable.\nGenerally, our recording of these provisions coincides with our commitment to a formal plan of action, or if earlier, on the closure or divestment of inactive sites. We recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable. The ultimate requirement for remediation and its cost are inherently difficult to estimate. We believe that the outcome of these uncertainties should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, or operating results.\nOur existing environmental conditions prior to the IPO are obligations contributed to us by the prior operator of these facilities, BP Pipelines, who has agreed to indemnify us with respect to such conditions under the terms of an omnibus agreement that we entered into in connection with the IPO.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Business and Properties, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 6. Selected Financial Data and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data. It should also be read together with Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this report.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn October 30, 2017, the Partnership completed the IPO of 42,500,000 common units representing limited partner interests at a price to the public of $18.00 per unit. Subsequent to the closing of the IPO, the underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option and purchased 5,294,358 additional common units at $18.00 per unit. A total of 47,794,358 common units were issued to the public unitholders in connection with the IPO. A registration statement on Form S-1, as amended through the time of its effectiveness, was filed by the Partnership with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and was declared effective on October 25, 2017. On October 26, 2017, the Partnership's common units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol BPMP\u201d.\nImmediately prior to the consummation of the IPO, BP Pipelines contributed the following interests to the Partnership:\n \u2022 100% ownership interest in each of BP Two Pipeline Company LLC (\"BP2 OpCo\"), BP River Rouge Company LLC (\"River Rouge OpCo\") and BP D-B Pipeline Company LLC (\"Diamondback OpCo\"); \n \u2022 28.5% ownership interest in Mars Oil Pipeline Company LLC ( Mars\u201d); and \n \u2022 20% managing member interest in Mardi Gras Transportation System Company LLC ( Mardi Gras\u201d), pursuant to which the Partnership has the right to vote Mardi Gras' ownership interest in each of Caesar Oil Pipeline Company LLC ( Caesar\u201d), Cleopatra Gas Gathering Company LLC ( Cleopatra\u201d), Proteus Oil Pipeline Company LLC ( Proteus\u201d) and Endymion Oil Pipeline Company LLC ( Endymion\u201d and together with Caesar, Cleopatra and Proteus, the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures\u201d). \nIn exchange for its contribution of such interests to the Partnership, BP Pipelines, through its wholly owned subsidiary, BP Midstream Partners Holdings LLC ( BP Holdco\u201d), and through BP Holdco's wholly owned subsidiary, BP Midstream Partners GP LLC (the General Partner\u201d), received:\n \u2022 4,581,177 common units and 52,375,535 subordinated units, representing an aggregate 54.4% limited partner interest; \n \u2022 all of the non-economic general partner interest and our incentive distribution rights; and \n \u2022 a cash distribution of $814.7 million, of which $814.4 million was paid as of December 31, 2017 and the remainder accrued in Accounts payable - related parties to be paid in 2018. \nThe Partnership received net proceeds of $814.7 million from the sale of 47,794,358 common units in the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, structuring fees and other offering expenses.\nPartnership Overview\nWe are a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by BP Pipelines to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets. Our assets consist of interests in entities that own crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent pipelines serving as key infrastructure for BP and other customers to transport onshore crude oil production to BP's crude oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana (the Whiting Refinery\u201d) and offshore crude oil and natural gas production to key refining markets and trading and distribution hubs. Certain of our assets deliver refined products and diluent from the Whiting Refinery and other U.S. supply hubs to major demand centers.\nOur assets consist of the following:\n \u2022 BP2 OpCo, which owns the BP#2 crude oil pipeline system ( BP2\u201d) consisting of approximately 12 miles of pipeline and related assets that transport crude oil from Griffith Station, Indiana, to the Whiting Refinery. \n \u2022 River Rouge OpCo, which owns the Whiting to River Rouge refined products pipeline system ( River Rouge\u201d) consisting of approximately 244 miles of pipeline and related assets that transport refined petroleum products from the Whiting Refinery to the refined products terminal at River Rouge, Michigan. \n \u2022 Diamondback OpCo, which owns the Diamondback diluent pipeline system ( Diamondback\u201d) consisting of approximately 42 miles of pipeline and related assets that transport diluent from Black Oak Junction, Indiana, to a third-party owned pipeline in Manhattan, Illinois. BP2, River Rouge, and Diamondback, together, are referred to as the \"Predecessor Assets\" or the \"Wholly Owned Assets\". \n \u2022 A 28.5% ownership interest in Mars, which owns a major corridor crude oil pipeline system in a high-growth area of the Gulf of Mexico, delivering crude oil production received from the Mississippi Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico to storage and distribution facilities at the Louisiana offshore oil port, which has access to multiple downstream markets. The Mars pipeline system is approximately 163 miles in length. \n \u2022 A 20% managing member interest in Mardi Gras, which holds the following investments in joint ventures: \n \u2022 A 56% ownership interest in Caesar, which owns approximately 115 miles of pipeline connecting platforms in the Southern Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico with the two connecting carrier pipelines. \n \u2022 A 53% ownership interest in Cleopatra, which owns an approximately 115 mile gas gathering pipeline system and provides gathering and transportation for multiple gas producers in the Southern Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico to the Manta Ray pipeline. \n \u2022 A 65% ownership interest in Proteus, which owns an approximately 70 mile crude oil pipeline system and provides transportation for multiple crude oil producers in the eastern Gulf of Mexico into the Endymion pipeline system described below. \n \u2022 A 65% ownership interest in Endymion, which originates downstream of Proteus, owns an approximately 90 mile crude oil pipeline system and provides transportation for multiple oil producers in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. \nHow We Generate Revenue\nOnshore Assets\nPrior to the IPO, we generated revenue on our onshore assets through published tariffs (regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\")) applied to volumes moved, with certain volumes on Diamondback transported at contracted rates.\nPrior to July 1, 2017, we did not have long-term fee-based transportation agreements in place for volumes transported on any of our assets, other than two long-term transportation agreements on Diamondback, neither of which had minimum volume commitments.\nEffective July 1, 2017, we entered into a throughput and deficiency agreement with our affiliate BP Products North America, Inc. ( BP Products\u201d), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BP, for transporting diluent on the Diamondback pipeline under a joint tariff agreement with a third-party carrier. This agreement contains a minimum volume requirement, under which BP Products has committed to pay us an incentive rate for a fixed minimum volume during the twelve-month running period from July 1, 2017 and each successive twelve-month period thereafter through June 30, 2020, whether or not such volumes are physically shipped through Diamondback.\nEffective upon the completion of the IPO, we entered into additional throughput and deficiency agreements with BP Products for each of our three wholly owned pipeline systems at BP2, River Rouge and Diamondback. Under these fee-based agreements, we provide transportation services to BP Products, in exchange for BP Products' commitment to pay us the applicable tariff rates for the minimum monthly volumes, whether or not such volumes are physically shipped by BP Products through our pipelines. BP Products is allowed to make up for the monthly deficiency within the same calendar year during the initial term ending December 31, 2020. Adjustment to the monthly deficiency payments remitted to us by BP Products, if any, is determined at the end of each calendar year based on the actual volume transported during such period.\nOffshore Assets\nMany of the contracts supporting our offshore assets include fee-based life-of-lease transportation dedications and require producers to transport all production from the specified fields connected to the pipeline for the life of the related oil lease without a minimum volume commitment. This agreement structure means that the dedicated production cannot be transported by any other\nmeans, such as barges or another pipeline. The Mars system has a combination of FERC-regulated tariff rates, intrastate rates, and contractual rates that apply to throughput movements and inventory management fees for excess inventory, and certain of those rates may be indexed with the FERC rate. Two of the Mars agreements also include provisions to guarantee a return to the pipeline to enable the pipeline to recover its investment, despite the uncertainty in production volumes, by providing for an annual transportation rate adjustment over a fixed period of time to achieve a fixed rate of return. The calculation for the fixed rate of return is based on actual project costs and operating costs. At the end of the fixed period, the rate will be locked in at a rate no greater than the last calculated rate and adjusted annually thereafter at a rate no less than zero percent and no greater than the FERC index.\nThe Proteus and Caesar pipelines have an order from the FERC declaring them to be contract carriers with negotiated rates and services. On Proteus and Caesar, the fees for the anchor shippers, which account for a majority of the volumes dedicated to Proteus and Caesar, respectively, were set for the life of the lease over the original lease volumes dedicated to Proteus and Caesar, and are not subject to annual escalation under their oil transportation contracts. The shippers have firm space that varies annually corresponding to their requested maximum daily quantity forecasts. The majority of our revenues on these pipelines are generated by our anchor shippers based on the specified fee for all transported volumes covered by oil transportation contracts with each shipper. Contracts entered into in connection with later connections to Proteus and Caesar may have different terms than the anchor shippers, including rates that vary with inflation.\nCleopatra is also a contract carrier. Each shipper on Cleopatra has a contract with negotiated rates. The rates are fixed for the anchor shippers' dedicated leases, are not subject to annual escalation and generate the majority of Cleopatra's revenues. Contracts for field connections for other shippers contain a variety of rate structures.\nEndymion is currently a contract carrier. However, it could be subject to intrastate or FERC jurisdiction under certain circumstances in the future. Endymion generates the majority of its revenues from contractual fees applied to the transportation of oil into storage and from fees applied to per barrel movements of oil out of storage (including volume incentive discounts for larger shippers using storage). The rates are fixed for the anchor shippers' agreements, are not subject to annual escalation and generate the majority of Endymion's revenues. Agreements for other shippers may have different terms than the anchor shippers, including rates that may vary with inflation.\nFixed Loss Allowance and Inventory Management Fees\nThe tariffs applicable to BP2 and Mars include a fixed loss allowance ( FLA\u201d). An FLA factor per barrel, a fixed percentage, is a separate fee under the crude oil tariffs to cover evaporation and other loss in transit. As crude oil is transported, we earn additional income based on the applicable FLA factor and the volume transported by the customer and the applicable prices. Under the tariff applicable to BP2 and Mars, allowance oil related revenue is recognized using the average market price for the relevant type of crude oil during the month the product is transported.\nIn addition, we are entitled to inventory management fees for Louisiana offshore oil port storage used by Endymion and Mars.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include: (i) safety and environmental metrics, (ii) revenue (including FLA) from throughput and utilization; (iii) operating expenses and maintenance spend; (iv) Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below); and (v) cash available for distribution.\nPreventative Safety and Environmental Metrics\nWe are committed to maintaining and improving the safety, reliability and efficiency of our operations. We have implemented reporting programs requiring all employees and contractors of our Parent who provide services to us to record environmental and safety-related incidents. Our management team uses these existing programs and data to evaluate trends and potential interventions to deliver on performance targets. We integrate health, occupational safety, process safety and environmental principles throughout our operations in order to reduce and eliminate environmental and safety-related incidents.\nThroughput\nThe amount of revenue our business generates primarily depends on our fee-based transportation agreements with shippers, our tariffs and the volumes of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent that we handle on our pipelines.\nThe volumes that we handle on our pipelines are primarily affected by the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. Our results of operations are impacted by our ability to:\n \u2022 utilize any remaining unused capacity on, or add additional capacity to, our pipeline systems; \n \u2022 increase throughput volumes on our pipeline systems by making connections to existing or new third-party pipelines or other facilities, primarily driven by the anticipated supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent; \n \u2022 identify and execute organic expansion projects; and \n \u2022 increase throughput volumes via acquisitions. \nOperating Expenses and Total Maintenance Spend\nOperating Expenses\nOur management seeks to maximize our profitability by effectively managing our operating expenses. These expenses are comprised primarily of labor expenses (including contractor services), general materials, supplies, minor maintenance, utility costs (including electricity and fuel) and insurance premiums. Utility costs fluctuate based on throughput volumes and the grades of crude oil and types of refined products we handle. Our other operating expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes, but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period.\nTotal Maintenance Spend\nWe calculate Total Maintenance Spend as the sum of maintenance expenses and maintenance capital expenditures, excluding any reimbursable maintenance capital expenditures. We track these expenses on a combined basis because it is useful to understanding our total maintenance requirements. Total Maintenance Spend for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, is shown in the table below:\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands of dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholly Owned Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital expenditures\n</td> <td>2,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Wholly Owned Assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mars and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital expenditures\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Mars and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Maintenance Spend\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>* Information is not applicable for the periods prior to the IPO.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Reflects the allocable portion of the maintenance expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and Total Maintenance Spend, as applicable, attributable to our 28.5% ownership interest in Mars and our 20% interest of the 56% ownership interest in Caesar, 53% interest in Cleopatra, 65% interest in Proteus and 65% interest in Endymion held by Mardi Gras. The maintenance expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and Total Maintenance Spend for Mars and each Mardi Gras Joint Ventures is shown for the post-IPO period from October 30, 2017 to December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe seek to maximize our profitability by effectively managing our maintenance expenses, which consist primarily of safety and environmental integrity programs. We seek to manage our maintenance expenses on the pipelines we operate by scheduling maintenance over time to avoid significant variability in our maintenance expenses and minimize their impact on our cash flows, without compromising our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship.\nOur maintenance expenses represent the costs we incur that do not significantly extend the useful life or increase the expected output of our property, plant and equipment. These expenses include pipeline repairs, replacements of immaterial sections of pipelines, inspections, equipment rentals and costs incurred to maintain compliance with existing safety and environmental\nstandards, irrespective of the magnitude of such compliance expenses. Our maintenance expenses vary significantly from period to period because certain of our expenses are the result of scheduled safety and environmental integrity programs, which occur on a multi-year cycle and require substantial outlays.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income taxes, gain or loss from disposition of property, plant and equipment, and depreciation and amortization, plus cash distributed to the Partnership from equity method investments for the applicable period, less income from equity method investments. We define Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership as Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. We present these financial measures because we believe replacing our proportionate share of our equity method investments' net income with the cash received from such equity method investments more accurately reflects the cash flow from our business, which is meaningful to our investors.\nWe compute and present cash available for distribution and define it as Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership less maintenance capital expenditures attributable to the Partnership, net interest paid/received, cash reserves, income taxes paid and net adjustments from volume deficiency payments attributable to the Partnership. Cash available for distribution does not reflect changes in working capital balances.\nAdjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution are non-GAAP (\"GAAP\" refers to United States generally accepted accounting principles) supplemental financial measures, which are metrics that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\n \u2022 our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods; \n \u2022 the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholders; \n \u2022 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and \n \u2022 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. \nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution are net income and net cash provided by operating activities, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities.\nAdjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or cash available for distribution in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. Please read Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d section below for the reconciliation of net income and cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results\nOur results of operations subsequent to the IPO are not comparable to our Predecessor's historical results of operations for the reasons described below:\nRevenues\nPrior to July 1, 2017, our Predecessor did not have agreements that contained minimum volume commitments. As of July 1, 2017, we entered into a throughput and deficiency agreement with BP Products for transporting diluent on Diamondback under a joint tariff agreement with a third-party carrier that contains minimum volume requirements. In connection with the IPO, we entered into additional throughput and deficiency agreements that contain minimum volume requirements with BP Products for each of our three Wholly Owned Assets. See Note 8 - Related Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details.\nContribution of Interests in Investments\nImmediately prior to the consummation of the IPO, BP Pipelines contributed to us 28.5% ownership interest in Mars and 20% managing member interest in Mardi Gras. We control and consolidate Mardi Gras via an agreement between us and our Parent, under which we have the right to vote 100% of Mardi Gras' ownership interests in each of the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures. Historical Predecessor results of operations consist of only the Predecessor Assets.\nExpenses\nOur Predecessor's operating and general and administrative expenses included direct charges for the management and operations of our assets and certain general corporate overhead, shared services and operating services allocated to us by BP Pipelines through October 29, 2017. These allocated expenses included but were not limited to finance, accounting, treasury, legal, information technology, human resources, shared services, government affairs, insurance, health, safety, security, employee benefits, incentives, severance and environmental functional support. These expenses were charged or allocated to our Predecessor Assets based on the nature of the expenses.\nSubsequent to the IPO, BP Pipelines charges us a combination of fixed and reimbursable charges for administrative and operating services under our omnibus agreement. We pay an annual fee, initially $13.3 million, to BP Pipelines for general and administrative services. The omnibus fee is structured to support all of our onshore and offshore assets, while the expenses allocated to the Predecessor only covered the Wholly Owned Assets.\nWe have begun incurring incremental general and administrative expenses attributable to being a publicly traded partnership. Such expenses include but are not limited to expenses associated with periodic reporting with the SEC, tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, NYSE listing, independent auditor fees, legal fees, investor relations expenses, transfer agent and registrar fees, outside director fees and compensation expense associated with the long-term incentive plan.\nIncome Taxes\nFederal income taxes were reflected on the historical financial statements of our Predecessor. The Partnership is a pass-through entity for federal and state income tax purposes and is not subject to federal and state income tax expense in its financial results.\nFinancing\nThere are differences in the way we finance our operations as compared to the way our Predecessor historically financed its operations. Historically, our Predecessor's operations were financed as part of BP Pipelines' integrated operations, and our Predecessor did not record any separate costs associated with financing its operations. Our Predecessor largely relied on internally-generated cash flows and capital contributions from BP Pipelines to satisfy its capital expenditure requirements. Subsequent to the IPO, we expect to fund future capital expenditures primarily from external sources, including borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility and potential future issuances of equity and debt securities.\nWe intend to make cash distributions to our unitholders at a minimum distribution rate of $0.2625 per unit per quarter ($1.05 per unit on an annualized basis). Based on the terms of our cash distribution policy, we expect that we will distribute to our unitholders and our general partner, as the holder of our incentive distribution rights, most of the cash generated by our operations.\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nOur business can be negatively affected by sustained downturns or slow growth in the economy in general, and is impacted by shifts in supply and demand dynamics, the mix of services requested by the customers of our pipelines, competition and changes in regulatory requirements affecting our customers' operations.\nWe believe the key factors that impact our business are the supply of and/or demand for crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent in the markets in which our business operates.\nWe also believe that our customers' requirements and government regulation of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent pipeline systems, discussed in more detail below, play an important role in how we manage our operations and implement our long-term strategies.\nChanges in Crude Oil and Natural Gas Sourcing and Refined Product and Diluent Demand Dynamics\nTo effectively manage our business, we monitor our market areas for both short-term and long-term shifts in crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent supply and demand. Changes in crude oil and natural gas supply such as new discoveries of reserves, declining production in older fields and the introduction of new sources of crude oil and natural gas supply, investment programs of our shippers to maintain or increase production, along with global supply and demand fundamentals such as the strength of the U.S. dollar, weather conditions and competition among oil producing countries for market share, affect the demand for our services from both producers and consumers. One of the strategic advantages of our crude oil pipeline system is its ability to transport attractively priced crude oil from multiple supply sources. Our crude oil shippers periodically change the relative mix of crude oil grades delivered to the refineries and markets served by our pipelines. While these changes in the sourcing patterns of crude oil transported are reflected in changes in the relative volumes of crude oil by type handled by our pipelines, our crude oil transportation revenue is primarily affected by changes in overall crude oil supply and demand dynamics.\nSimilarly, our refined products pipeline system has the ability to serve multiple demand centers. Our refined products shippers periodically change the relative mix of refined products shipped on our refined products pipeline system, as well as the destination points, based on changes in pricing and demand dynamics. While these changes in shipping patterns are reflected in relative types of refined products handled by our pipeline, our total product transportation revenue is primarily affected by changes in overall refined products and diluent supply and demand dynamics.\nFurther, the volumes of crude oil that we transport on our BP2 system and refined products and diluent that we distribute on our River Rouge and Diamondback systems depend substantially on the economics of available crude supply for the Whiting Refinery and the economics for refined products and diluent demand in the markets that the pipelines serve. These economics are affected by numerous factors beyond our control.\nAs these supply and demand dynamics shift, we anticipate that we will continue to actively pursue projects that link new sources of supply to producers and consumers. Similarly, as demand dynamics change, we anticipate that we will create new services or capacity arrangements that meet customer requirements.\nChanges in Commodity Prices\nWe do not engage in the marketing and trading of any commodities. We do not take ownership of crude oil, natural gas, refined products or diluent. As a result, our exposure to commodity price fluctuations is limited to the FLA provisions in our tariffs, which are only applicable to our crude oil pipelines. We also have indirect exposure to commodity price fluctuations to the extent such fluctuations affect the shipping patterns of our customers.\nMajor Expansion Projects\nWe currently have one major expansion project planned in 2018. An affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell plc (\"Shell\") is currently building the Mattox pipeline, which will connect to Proteus for the mutual benefit of all parties involved. Through this upstream connection, Proteus will transport all of the volumes from Shell's recently sanctioned Appomattox platform. Proteus is also constructing a new connecting platform adjacent to South Pass 89E platform that will accommodate volumes from the Mattox pipeline. In addition, the new Proteus platform will provide space for future pumping equipment and the ability to increase the capacity of the Proteus system to over 700 kbpd.\nThe total project cost is expected to be approximately $345.0 million from 2015 to 2019, which are fully reimbursable to Proteus from third-party investors that are not affiliated with the Partnership. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Proteus incurred $147.3 million of capitalized costs. We expect the Appomattox expansion capital expenditures to be approximately $119.8 million in 2018.\nCustomers\nBP is our primary customer. Transportation revenue from BP represented 97.6%, 94.4%, and 93.8% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. BP's volumes represented approximately 97.4%, 95.2% and 95.3% of the aggregate total volumes transported on the Wholly Owned Assets for the period from January 1, 2017 through October 29, 2017, and the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. BP's volumes represented approximately 54.5% of the aggregate total volumes transported on the Wholly Owned Assets, Mars and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures combined for the period from October 30, 2017 through December 31, 2017.\nIn addition, we transport crude oil, natural gas and diluent for a mix of third-party customers, including crude oil producers, refiners, marketers and traders, and our assets are connected to other crude oil, natural gas and diluent pipeline systems. In addition to serving directly connected Midwestern U.S. and Gulf Coast markets, our pipelines have access to customers in various regions of the United States and Canada through interconnections with other major pipelines. Our customers use our transportation services for a variety of reasons. Producers of crude oil require the ability to deliver their product to market and frequently enter into firm transportation contracts to ensure that they will have sufficient capacity available to deliver their product to delivery points with greatest market liquidity. Marketers and traders generate income from buying and selling crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent to capitalize on price differentials over time or between markets. Our customer mix can vary over time and largely depends on the crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent supply and demand dynamics in our markets.\nCompetition\nOur pipelines face competition from a variety of alternative transportation methods including rail, water borne movements including barging and shipping, trucking and other pipelines that service the same markets as our pipelines. Competition for BP2 and River Rouge common carrier pipelines is based primarily on connectivity to sources of supply and demand, while Diamondback faces competition for Gulf Coast sourced diluent from third-party pipelines, which have made direct connections at Manhattan, Illinois. Our offshore pipelines compete for new production on the basis of geographic proximity to the production, cost of connection, available capacity, transportation rates and access to onshore markets.\nRegulation\nOur interstate common carrier pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies including the FERC, Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and the Department of Transportation (\"DOT\"). For more information on federal, state and local regulations affecting our business, please read Part I, Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties within this report.\nAcquisition Opportunities\nWe plan to pursue acquisitions of complementary assets from BP as well as third parties. We also may pursue acquisitions jointly with BP Pipelines. BP Pipelines has granted us a right of first offer with respect to its retained ownership interest in Mardi Gras and all of its interests in midstream pipeline systems and assets related thereto in the contiguous United States and offshore Gulf of Mexico that were owned by BP Pipelines at the closing of the IPO. Neither BP nor any of its affiliates are under any obligation, however, to sell or offer to sell us additional assets or to pursue acquisitions jointly with us, and we are under no obligation to buy any additional assets from them or to pursue any joint acquisitions with them. We will focus our acquisition strategy on transportation and midstream assets within the crude oil, natural gas and refined products sectors. We believe that we are well positioned to acquire midstream assets from BP, and particularly BP Pipelines, as well as third parties, should such opportunities arise. Identifying and executing acquisitions will be a key part of our strategy. However, if we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth will be limited, and the acquisitions we do make may reduce, rather than increase, our available cash.\nSeasonality\nThe volumes of crude oil, refined products and diluent transported in our pipelines are directly affected by the level of supply and demand for such commodities in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. However, many effects of seasonality on our revenue will be substantially mitigated through the use of our fee-based long-term agreements with BP Products that include minimum volume commitments.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables and discussion contain a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. For periods prior the closing of our IPO, all financial data included in this section of the report reflect the results of our Predecessor for accounting purposes. For the period subsequent to the closing of the IPO (i.e., October 30, 2017 through December 31, 2017), the financial data reflect the results of the Partnership.\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td>

The increase in throughput volume at BP2 during the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to a lower level of maintenance activities performed on Whiting Refinery equipment during this period, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The overall increase in revenue was partially offset by (i) a $7.5 million decrease in throughput revenue at Diamondback due to a 31.9% reduction in throughput volume primarily driven by lower Whiting Refinery diluent production, (ii) a $0.6 million decrease in throughput revenue at River Rouge, and (iii) a $0.6 million decrease in revenue from reimbursable projects at BP2.\nOperating expenses increased by $2.0 million, or 14.3%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to (i) a $1.1 million increase in insurance expense caused by a higher internal allocation from the Parent prior to the IPO in 2017 compared with 2016 and a higher insurance premium covering the Wholly Owned Assets, Mars, and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures subsequent to the IPO, and (ii) a $0.8 million increase in electricity expense results from an increase in throughput volumes at BP2 and higher electrical usage due to pump and motor constraints at River Rouge during 2017.\nMaintenance expenses increased by $2.0 million, or 67.9%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of increased maintenance project activities primarily related to River Rouge, including in-line inspections and repairs emanating from the in-line inspections. In-line inspections started in the fourth quarter of 2016 and incurred cost of $2.7 million in 2017. This increase was partially offset by the costs incurred by the River Rouge projects completed in 2016, such as casing test station installations at fourteen sites and cathodic protection maintenance required from the annual survey, which incurred total project costs of $0.8 million in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $0.6 million, or 7.3%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Prior to the IPO, general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of expenses allocated\nfrom the Parent. Subsequent to the IPO, general and administrative expenses primary consist of a fixed fee of $13.3 million per year under an omnibus agreement that we entered into with our Parent in connection with the IPO and additional costs incurred as a result of being a publicly traded partnership.\nDepreciation expense remained relatively flat at $2.7 million and $2.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nProperty and other tax expense remained flat at $0.4 million in both of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nIncome from equity method investments was $17.9 million in 2017 due to earnings from Mars and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures from October 30, 2017 through December 31, 2017, after they were contributed to us in connection with the IPO.\nOther income was less than $0.1 million and $0.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Other income represents the changes in fair value of the embedded derivative associated with the allowance oil receivable incurred prior to October 1, 2017. Pursuant to a related party agreement, allowance oil receivable incurred on and after October 1, 2017 is settled at the commodity prices of the movement month and no longer contains an embedded derivative that would result in gain and losses due to changes in fair value.\nInterest expense, net was $0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. In connection with the IPO, we entered into a $600.0 million revolving credit facility agreement. The $0.1 million of net interest consisted of interest expense and commitment and utilization fees, which were partially offset by interest income on cash deposits held by BPMP.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $4.1 million, or 14.1%, due to a change in tax status upon completion of the IPO. Prior to the IPO, the Predecessor was included in the consolidated income tax returns of our Parent which is subject to federal and state income taxes. The effective tax rate during the period ended October 29, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016, remained consistent at 39.1%. Subsequent to the IPO, the Partnership is treated as a pass-through entity for federal and state income tax purposes. There is no federal and state income taxes for the period subsequent the IPO.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nTotal revenue decreased by $3.8 million, or 3.5%, primarily due to activity from our BP2 pipeline, including a $4.6 million reduction from volumes and a $1.8 million decrease in FLA revenue in 2016 that were partially offset by a 1.3% increase in BP2's average pipeline tariff. Throughput volumes for BP2 decreased by 10.1%, primarily because the Whiting Refinery completed a significant scheduled turnaround, which occurred periodically, in 2016. The revenue decrease was partially offset by a $1.9 million revenue increase from Diamondback due to a 0.8% throughput volumes increase and by a $0.7 million revenue increase in River Rouge due a 2.2% average tariff increase.\nOperating expenses decreased in 2016 by $0.3 million, or 2.2%, primarily as a result of a reduction of insurance costs of $1.7 million and lower variable power costs of $0.3 million partially offset by increased environmental remediation accrual costs of $1.3 million, increased chemical costs of $0.3 million and an increase in other costs of $0.1 million. Insurance costs decreased due to a restructuring of the insurance program and the rates charged by insurers. Power costs decreased due to decreased throughput volume, in addition to drag reducing agents (\"DRA\") being added to River Rouge. The environmental remediation accrual costs increased due to a revision in our environmental liabilities. The increased chemical costs resulted from the cost to purchase the DRA for River Rouge.\nMaintenance expenses decreased in 2016 by $0.9 million, or 23.8%, as a result of decreased project costs. Project costs decreased primarily due to the completion of larger projects during 2015, including relocating a portion of River Rouge to maintain right of way status and the completion of a potential leak investigation.\nGeneral and administrative expense remained relatively flat year over year. General and administrative expenses consisted of expenses allocated by our Parent.\nDepreciation expense was $2.6 million in 2016 as compared with $2.5 million in 2015.\nProperty and other tax expense remained relatively flat year over year.\nOther income (loss) was $0.5 million and $(0.6) million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other income (loss) represented the changes in fair value in earnings related to the embedded derivative within the allowance oil receivable.\nIncome tax expense remained relatively flat year over year.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income and to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods indicated.\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands of dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution to Net Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>2,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain from disposition of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>25,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions received from equity method investments -

Prior to the IPO, we participated in BP Pipelines' centralized cash management system; therefore, our cash receipts were deposited in BP Pipelines' or its affiliates' bank accounts, all cash disbursements were made from those accounts, and we maintained no bank accounts dedicated solely to our assets. Thus, historically our financial statements have reflected no cash balances prior to the IPO.\nFollowing the IPO, we maintain separate bank accounts, and BP Pipelines continues to provide treasury services on our General Partner's behalf under our omnibus agreement. We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations (including distribution from our equity method investments), borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of debt and additional equity securities. The entities in which we own an interest may also incur debt. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term working capital requirements and long-term capital expenditure requirements and to make quarterly cash distributions.\nThe board of directors of our general partner has adopted a cash distribution policy pursuant to which we intend to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2625 per unit per quarter, which equates to approximately $27.5 million per quarter, or approximately $110.0 million per year in the aggregate, based on the number of common and subordinated units currently outstanding. We intend to pay such distributions to the extent we have sufficient cash after the establishment of cash reserves and the payment of our expenses, including payments to our general partner and its affiliates.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn October 30, 2017, the Partnership entered into a $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the credit facility\u201d) with an affiliate of BP. The credit facility terminates on October 30, 2022 and provides for certain covenants, including the requirement to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio, which is calculated as total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit facility), not to exceed 5.0 to 1.0, subject to a temporary increase in such ratio to 5.5 to 1.0 in connection with certain material acquisitions. In addition, the limited liability company agreement of our General Partner requires the approval of BP Holdco prior to the incurrence of any indebtedness that would cause our leverage ratio to exceed 4.5 to 1.0.\nThe credit facility also contains customary events of default, such as (i) nonpayment of principal when due, (ii) nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts, (iii) breach of covenants, (iv) misrepresentation, (v) cross-payment default and cross-acceleration (in each case, to indebtedness in excess of $75.0 million) and (vi) insolvency. Additionally, the credit facility limits our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional debt, (ii) redeem or repurchase units or make distributions under certain circumstances; and (iii) incur certain liens or permit them to exist. Indebtedness under this facility bears interest at the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") plus 0.85%. This facility includes customary fees, including a commitment fee of 0.10% and a utilization fee of 0.20%. At December 31, 2017, $15.0 million was drawn and outstanding from the credit facility.\nCash Flows from Our Operations\nOperating Activities. We generated $69.2 million in cash flow from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the $49.8 million generated in the year ended December 31, 2016. The $19.4 million increase in cash flows from operations primarily resulted from an increase in net income attributed to the Wholly Owned Assets and the distributions from equity method investments that were contributed to us in connection with the IPO. The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities position primarily in accounts receivable from related parties.\nOur Predecessor generated $49.8 million in cash flow from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $48.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to a change in accounts receivable position from both third and related parties in addition to an increase in accounts payable to third parties partially offset by a decrease resulting from a change in the allowance oil receivable position.\nInvesting Activities. Our cash flow generated by investing activities was $5.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $3.4 million used in the year ended December 31, 2016. The $8.4 million increase in cash flow used in investing activities is due to the post-IPO distribution in excess of earnings received from equity method investments and a decrease in capital expenditures on maintenance projects during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur Predecessor's cash flow used in investing activities was $3.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $0.7 million used in the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash flow used in investing activities is due to increased cash paid for capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities. Our cash flow used in financing activities was $41.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $46.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we distributed $814.4 million of the $814.7 million net proceeds that we received from the IPO to our Parent with the remaining $0.3 million recorded in Accounts payable - related parties on the consolidated balance sheets. We also distributed $9.4 million of dividends to the prior owners of Mars and Mardi Gras, which were prorated for the fourth quarter period prior to the IPO. An additional $9.5 million was distributed to our Parent for its noncontrolling interests in Mardi Gras.\nPrior to October 30, 2017, all of our Predecessor's cash flow was advanced through BP Pipelines' centralized cash management system. Net cash used in financing activities prior to the IPO was $37.8 million for 2017, compared to $46.4 million in 2016, both of which were transfers to BP Pipelines. The use of cash in 2017 was partially offset by a $15.0 million draw from the credit facility after the IPO.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $46.4 million for 2016 compared to $47.5 million in 2015, both of which were transfers to BP Pipelines. The decrease in transfers resulted from a decrease in net income year over year.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur operations can be capital intensive, requiring investment to expand, upgrade or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. Our capital requirements consist of Maintenance Capital Expenditures and Expansion Capital Expenditures, both as defined in our partnership agreement. We are required to distinguish between Maintenance Capital\nExpenditures and Expansion Capital Expenditures in accordance with our partnership agreement, even though historically we did not make a distinction between Maintenance Capital Expenditures and Expansion Capital Expenditures in exactly the same way as is required under our partnership agreement.\nA summary of our capital expenditures, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, is shown in the table below:\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands of dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash spent on maintenance capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease)/Increase in accrued capital expenditures\n</td> <td>(1,306\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>603\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures incurred\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur capital expenditures for 2017 were $1.0 million, primarily associated with the following projects:\n \u2022 Continuation of leak detection metering upgrades for BP2; and \n \u2022 Replacement and installation of new transformer at Ann Arbor station for River Rouge \nOur capital expenditures for 2016 were $4.0 million, primarily associated with the following projects:\n \u2022 Leak detection metering upgrades for BP2; \n \u2022 Relief valve redesign implementation at South Bend station for River Rouge; and \n \u2022 Continuation of installation of DRA at five stations for River Rouge \nOur capital expenditures for 2015 were $1.3 million, primarily associated with the following projects:\n \u2022 Installation of DRA at five stations for River Rouge; and \n \u2022 Relief valve redesign implementation at South Bend station for River Rouge \nAll of our capital expenditures in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were maintenance expenditures. We did not incur any expansion capital expenditures during such periods.\nWe expect maintenance capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 million for the year ending December 31, 2018, which will primarily be related to regulatory and asset integrity projects.\nWe anticipate that our 2018 maintenance capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations and our borrowings under the credit facility.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017, is shown in the table below:\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands of dollars)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 2 to 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 4 to 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service contract\n</td> <td>212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions. We have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership and related notes thereto and believe those policies are reasonable and appropriate.\nWe apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with GAAP. Our more critical accounting policies include those related to revenue recognition, allowance oil, and environmental and legal obligations. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates. We periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are primarily generated from crude oil, refined products and diluent transportation services. In general, we recognize revenue from customers when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the price is fixed or determinable and allocated to the performance obligations in the contract; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.\nDuring the second half of 2017, we entered into multiple long-term fee-based transportation agreements with BP Products, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BP. Under these agreements, BP Products has committed to pay us the minimum volumes at the applicable rates for each of the twelve-month measurement periods specified by the applicable agreements whether or not such volumes are physically transported through our pipelines. BP Products is allowed to make up for shortfall volumes during each of the measurement periods.\nContracts with BP Products, including the allowance oil arrangements discussed below, are accounted for as separate arrangements because they do not meet the criteria for combination. We record revenue for crude oil, refined products and diluent transportation over the period in which they are earned (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place, or the services designated in the contract have been performed). Revenue from transportation services is recognized upon delivery based on contractual rates related to throughput volumes. We accrue revenue based on services rendered but not billed for that accounting month.\nBillings to BP Products for deficiency volumes under its minimum volume commitments, if any, are recorded in Accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, as BP Products has the right to make up the deficiency volumes within the measurement period specified by the agreements. The deferred balance is recognized in revenue when the make-up rights contractually expire or when the uncertainty around the possibility to make up for the shortfall diminishes, whichever is earlier.\nAllowance Oil\nOur tariff for crude oil transportation at BP2 includes an FLA. An FLA factor per barrel, a fixed percentage, is a separate fee under the applicable crude oil tariff to cover evaporation and other loss in transit. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, all of our revenue at BP2 was generated from services to our Parent.\nAs crude oil is transported, we earn additional income based on the applicable FLA factor and the volume transported by our Parent measured at the receipt location. We do not take physical possession of the allowance oil as a result of our services, but record the value of the volumes accumulated as a receivable from our Parent. We recognize the FLA income in Revenue-related parties on the consolidated statements of operations during the periods when commodities are transported. The amount of revenue recognized is a product of the quantity transported, the applicable FLA factor and the settlement price during the month the product is transported. We cash settle allowance oil receivable with our Parent in the subsequent periods after the transportation service has been performed. The settlement payment is a product of the quantity settled and the applicable settlement price per unit. Once\nthe settlement price is known, we reclassify the balance out of Allowance oil receivable and accrue it in Accounts receivable - related parties on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe settlement price for volumes accumulated prior to October 1, 2017 was a summation of the calendar-month average of West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) on the New York Mercantile Exchange and a differential provided by our Parent. The differential represents the difference in market price between WTI and the type of allowance oil to be settled and the difference in market price between the settlement month and the month prior to settlement. The fluctuation in commodity prices between the month of movement and the month of settlement resulted in an embedded derivative, which we measured along with the allowance oil receivable in their entirety at fair value because the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative were clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host arrangement. The allowance oil volumes accumulated prior to October 1, 2017 were entirely settled upon October 30, 2017. While such volumes were outstanding, we recognized the changes in their fair value in Other income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. The embedded derivative was not designated as a hedging instrument.\nThe settlement price for volumes accumulated on and after October 1, 2017 is determined using the same equation as the prior periods but with pricing input from the month of movement, instead of the month of settlement, pursuant to a related party agreement that we entered into with our affiliate. The settlement price is fixed and determinable upon the completion of transportation. As a result, the allowance oil balances at December 31, 2017 and onward no longer contain a derivative feature or result in a gain or loss related to the change in its fair value. We now settle the allowance oil at the end of each period; therefore, the balances are entirely recorded in Accounts receivable - related parties after October 1, 2017.\nLegal\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as the result of our business operations and transactions. We utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders, judgments or settlements. In general, we expense legal costs as incurred. When we identify specific litigation that is expected to continue for a significant period of time, is reasonably possible to occur and may require substantial expenditures, we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to litigate the matter to a conclusion or reach an acceptable settlement, and we accrue for the lower end of the range. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates, or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings will be affected.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws require us to take future action to remediate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemicals or petroleum substances by us or other parties. Environmental expenditures that are required to obtain future economic benefits from its assets are capitalized as part of those assets. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future earnings shall be expensed, unless already provisioned for, which then shall be charged against provisions.\nProvisions are recognized when we have a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event. It is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. We do not discount environmental liabilities, and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable, and when we can reasonably estimate the costs. In making environmental liability estimations, we consider the material effect of environmental compliance, pending legal actions against us and potential third-party liability claims. Often, as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses, additional information is obtained, requiring revisions to estimated costs. These revisions are reflected in our income in the year in which they are probable and reasonably estimable.\nGenerally, our recording of these provisions coincides with our commitment to a formal plan of action, or if earlier, on the closure or divestment of inactive sites. We recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable. The ultimate requirement for remediation and its cost are inherently difficult to estimate. We believe that the outcome of these uncertainties should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, or operating results.\nOur existing environmental conditions prior to the IPO are obligations contributed to us by the prior operator of these facilities, BP Pipelines, who has agreed to indemnify us with respect to such conditions under the terms of an omnibus agreement that we entered into in connection with the IPO.", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

Subsequent to the closing of the IPO, the underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option and purchased 5,294,358 additional common units at $18.00 per unit. A total of 47,794,358 common units were issued to the public unitholders in connection with the IPO. A registration statement on Form S-1, as amended through the time of its effectiveness, was filed by the Partnership with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and was declared effective on October 25, 2017. On October 26, 2017, the Partnership's common units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol BPMP\u201d.\nImmediately prior to the consummation of the IPO, BP Pipelines contributed the following interests to the Partnership:\n \u2022 100% ownership interest in each of BP Two Pipeline Company LLC (\"BP2 OpCo\"), BP River Rouge Company LLC (\"River Rouge OpCo\") and BP D-B Pipeline Company LLC (\"Diamondback OpCo\"); \n \u2022 28.5% ownership interest in Mars Oil Pipeline Company LLC ( Mars\u201d); and \n \u2022 20% managing member interest in Mardi Gras Transportation System Company LLC ( Mardi Gras\u201d), pursuant to which the Partnership has the right to vote Mardi Gras' ownership interest in each of Caesar Oil Pipeline Company LLC ( Caesar\u201d), Cleopatra Gas Gathering Company LLC ( Cleopatra\u201d), Proteus Oil Pipeline Company LLC ( Proteus\u201d) and Endymion Oil Pipeline Company LLC ( Endymion\u201d and together with Caesar, Cleopatra and Proteus, the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures\u201d). \nIn exchange for its contribution of such interests to the Partnership, BP Pipelines, through its wholly owned subsidiary, BP Midstream Partners Holdings LLC ( BP Holdco\u201d), and through BP Holdco's wholly owned subsidiary, BP Midstream Partners GP LLC (the General Partner\u201d), received:\n \u2022 4,581,177 common units and 52,375,535 subordinated units, representing an aggregate 54.4% limited partner interest; \n \u2022 all of the non-economic general partner interest and our incentive distribution rights; and \n \u2022 a cash distribution of $814.7 million, of which $814.4 million was paid as of December 31, 2017 and the remainder accrued in Accounts payable - related parties to be paid in 2018. \nThe Partnership received net proceeds of $814.7 million from the sale of 47,794,358 common units in the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, structuring fees and other offering expenses.\nPartnership Overview\nWe are a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by BP Pipelines to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets. Our assets consist of interests in entities that own crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent pipelines serving as key infrastructure for BP and other customers to transport onshore crude oil production to BP's crude oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana (the Whiting Refinery\u201d) and offshore crude oil and natural gas production to key refining markets and trading and distribution hubs. Certain of our assets deliver refined products and diluent from the Whiting Refinery and other U.S. supply hubs to major demand centers.\nOur assets consist of the following:\n \u2022 BP2 OpCo, which owns the BP#2 crude oil pipeline system ( BP2\u201d) consisting of approximately 12 miles of pipeline and related assets that transport crude oil from Griffith Station, Indiana, to the Whiting Refinery. \n \u2022 River Rouge OpCo, which owns the Whiting to River Rouge refined products pipeline system ( River Rouge\u201d) consisting of approximately 244 miles of pipeline and related assets that transport refined petroleum products from the Whiting Refinery to the refined products terminal at River Rouge, Michigan. \n \u2022 Diamondback OpCo, which owns the Diamondback diluent pipeline system ( Diamondback\u201d) consisting of approximately 42 miles of pipeline and related assets that transport diluent from Black Oak Junction, Indiana, to a third-party owned pipeline in Manhattan, Illinois. BP2, River Rouge, and Diamondback, together, are referred to as the \"Predecessor Assets\" or the \"Wholly Owned Assets\". \n \u2022 A 28.5% ownership interest in Mars, which owns a major corridor crude oil pipeline system in a high-growth area of the Gulf of Mexico, delivering crude oil production received from the Mississippi Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico to storage and distribution facilities at the Louisiana offshore oil port, which has access to multiple downstream markets. The Mars pipeline system is approximately 163 miles in length. \n \u2022 A 20% managing member interest in Mardi Gras, which holds the following investments in joint ventures: \n \u2022 A 56% ownership interest in Caesar, which owns approximately 115 miles of pipeline connecting platforms in the Southern Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico with the two connecting carrier pipelines. \n \u2022 A 53% ownership interest in Cleopatra, which owns an approximately 115 mile gas gathering pipeline system and provides gathering and transportation for multiple gas producers in the Southern Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico to the Manta Ray pipeline. \n \u2022 A 65% ownership interest in Proteus, which owns an approximately 70 mile crude oil pipeline system and provides transportation for multiple crude oil producers in the eastern Gulf of Mexico into the Endymion pipeline system described below. \n \u2022 A 65% ownership interest in Endymion, which originates downstream of Proteus, owns an approximately 90 mile crude oil pipeline system and provides transportation for multiple oil producers in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. \nHow We Generate Revenue\nOnshore Assets\nPrior to the IPO, we generated revenue on our onshore assets through published tariffs (regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\")) applied to volumes moved, with certain volumes on Diamondback transported at contracted rates.\nPrior to July 1, 2017, we did not have long-term fee-based transportation agreements in place for volumes transported on any of our assets, other than two long-term transportation agreements on Diamondback, neither of which had minimum volume commitments.\nEffective July 1, 2017, we entered into a throughput and deficiency agreement with our affiliate BP Products North America, Inc. ( BP Products\u201d), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BP, for transporting diluent on the Diamondback pipeline under a joint tariff agreement with a third-party carrier. This agreement contains a minimum volume requirement, under which BP Products has committed to pay us an incentive rate for a fixed minimum volume during the twelve-month running period from July 1, 2017 and each successive twelve-month period thereafter through June 30, 2020, whether or not such volumes are physically shipped through Diamondback.\nEffective upon the completion of the IPO, we entered into additional throughput and deficiency agreements with BP Products for each of our three wholly owned pipeline systems at BP2, River Rouge and Diamondback. Under these fee-based agreements, we provide transportation services to BP Products, in exchange for BP Products' commitment to pay us the applicable tariff rates for the minimum monthly volumes, whether or not such volumes are physically shipped by BP Products through our pipelines. BP Products is allowed to make up for the monthly deficiency within the same calendar year during the initial term ending December 31, 2020. Adjustment to the monthly deficiency payments remitted to us by BP Products, if any, is determined at the end of each calendar year based on the actual volume transported during such period.\nOffshore Assets\nMany of the contracts supporting our offshore assets include fee-based life-of-lease transportation dedications and require producers to transport all production from the specified fields connected to the pipeline for the life of the related oil lease without a minimum volume commitment. This agreement structure means that the dedicated production cannot be transported by any other\nmeans, such as barges or another pipeline. The Mars system has a combination of FERC-regulated tariff rates, intrastate rates, and contractual rates that apply to throughput movements and inventory management fees for excess inventory, and certain of those rates may be indexed with the FERC rate. Two of the Mars agreements also include provisions to guarantee a return to the pipeline to enable the pipeline to recover its investment, despite the uncertainty in production volumes, by providing for an annual transportation rate adjustment over a fixed period of time to achieve a fixed rate of return. The calculation for the fixed rate of return is based on actual project costs and operating costs. At the end of the fixed period, the rate will be locked in at a rate no greater than the last calculated rate and adjusted annually thereafter at a rate no less than zero percent and no greater than the FERC index.\nThe Proteus and Caesar pipelines have an order from the FERC declaring them to be contract carriers with negotiated rates and services. On Proteus and Caesar, the fees for the anchor shippers, which account for a majority of the volumes dedicated to Proteus and Caesar, respectively, were set for the life of the lease over the original lease volumes dedicated to Proteus and Caesar, and are not subject to annual escalation under their oil transportation contracts. The shippers have firm space that varies annually corresponding to their requested maximum daily quantity forecasts. The majority of our revenues on these pipelines are generated by our anchor shippers based on the specified fee for all transported volumes covered by oil transportation contracts with each shipper. Contracts entered into in connection with later connections to Proteus and Caesar may have different terms than the anchor shippers, including rates that vary with inflation.\nCleopatra is also a contract carrier. Each shipper on Cleopatra has a contract with negotiated rates. The rates are fixed for the anchor shippers' dedicated leases, are not subject to annual escalation and generate the majority of Cleopatra's revenues. Contracts for field connections for other shippers contain a variety of rate structures.\nEndymion is currently a contract carrier. However, it could be subject to intrastate or FERC jurisdiction under certain circumstances in the future. Endymion generates the majority of its revenues from contractual fees applied to the transportation of oil into storage and from fees applied to per barrel movements of oil out of storage (including volume incentive discounts for larger shippers using storage). The rates are fixed for the anchor shippers' agreements, are not subject to annual escalation and generate the majority of Endymion's revenues. Agreements for other shippers may have different terms than the anchor shippers, including rates that may vary with inflation.\nFixed Loss Allowance and Inventory Management Fees\nThe tariffs applicable to BP2 and Mars include a fixed loss allowance ( FLA\u201d). An FLA factor per barrel, a fixed percentage, is a separate fee under the crude oil tariffs to cover evaporation and other loss in transit. As crude oil is transported, we earn additional income based on the applicable FLA factor and the volume transported by the customer and the applicable prices. Under the tariff applicable to BP2 and Mars, allowance oil related revenue is recognized using the average market price for the relevant type of crude oil during the month the product is transported.\nIn addition, we are entitled to inventory management fees for Louisiana offshore oil port storage used by Endymion and Mars.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include: (i) safety and environmental metrics, (ii) revenue (including FLA) from throughput and utilization; (iii) operating expenses and maintenance spend; (iv) Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below); and (v) cash available for distribution.\nPreventative Safety and Environmental Metrics\nWe are committed to maintaining and improving the safety, reliability and efficiency of our operations. We have implemented reporting programs requiring all employees and contractors of our Parent who provide services to us to record environmental and safety-related incidents. Our management team uses these existing programs and data to evaluate trends and potential interventions to deliver on performance targets. We integrate health, occupational safety, process safety and environmental principles throughout our operations in order to reduce and eliminate environmental and safety-related incidents.\nThroughput\nThe amount of revenue our business generates primarily depends on our fee-based transportation agreements with shippers, our tariffs and the volumes of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent that we handle on our pipelines.\nThe volumes that we handle on our pipelines are primarily affected by the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. Our results of operations are impacted by our ability to:\n \u2022 utilize any remaining unused capacity on, or add additional capacity to, our pipeline systems; \n \u2022 increase throughput volumes on our pipeline systems by making connections to existing or new third-party pipelines or other facilities, primarily driven by the anticipated supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent; \n \u2022 identify and execute organic expansion projects; and \n \u2022 increase throughput volumes via acquisitions. \nOperating Expenses and Total Maintenance Spend\nOperating Expenses\nOur management seeks to maximize our profitability by effectively managing our operating expenses. These expenses are comprised primarily of labor expenses (including contractor services), general materials, supplies, minor maintenance, utility costs (including electricity and fuel) and insurance premiums. Utility costs fluctuate based on throughput volumes and the grades of crude oil and types of refined products we handle. Our other operating expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes, but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period.\nTotal Maintenance Spend\nWe calculate Total Maintenance Spend as the sum of maintenance expenses and maintenance capital expenditures, excluding any reimbursable maintenance capital expenditures. We track these expenses on a combined basis because it is useful to understanding our total maintenance requirements. Total Maintenance Spend for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, is shown in the table below:\n\nWe seek to maximize our profitability by effectively managing our maintenance expenses, which consist primarily of safety and environmental integrity programs. We seek to manage our maintenance expenses on the pipelines we operate by scheduling maintenance over time to avoid significant variability in our maintenance expenses and minimize their impact on our cash flows, without compromising our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship.\nOur maintenance expenses represent the costs we incur that do not significantly extend the useful life or increase the expected output of our property, plant and equipment. These expenses include pipeline repairs, replacements of immaterial sections of pipelines, inspections, equipment rentals and costs incurred to maintain compliance with existing safety and environmental\nstandards, irrespective of the magnitude of such compliance expenses. Our maintenance expenses vary significantly from period to period because certain of our expenses are the result of scheduled safety and environmental integrity programs, which occur on a multi-year cycle and require substantial outlays.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income taxes, gain or loss from disposition of property, plant and equipment, and depreciation and amortization, plus cash distributed to the Partnership from equity method investments for the applicable period, less income from equity method investments. We define Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership as Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. We present these financial measures because we believe replacing our proportionate share of our equity method investments' net income with the cash received from such equity method investments more accurately reflects the cash flow from our business, which is meaningful to our investors.\nWe compute and present cash available for distribution and define it as Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership less maintenance capital expenditures attributable to the Partnership, net interest paid/received, cash reserves, income taxes paid and net adjustments from volume deficiency payments attributable to the Partnership. Cash available for distribution does not reflect changes in working capital balances.\nAdjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution are non-GAAP (\"GAAP\" refers to United States generally accepted accounting principles) supplemental financial measures, which are metrics that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\n \u2022 our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods; \n \u2022 the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholders; \n \u2022 our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and \n \u2022 the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. \nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution are net income and net cash provided by operating activities, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities.\nAdjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or cash available for distribution in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility. Please read Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d section below for the reconciliation of net income and cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results\nOur results of operations subsequent to the IPO are not comparable to our Predecessor's historical results of operations for the reasons described below:\nRevenues\nPrior to July 1, 2017, our Predecessor did not have agreements that contained minimum volume commitments. As of July 1, 2017, we entered into a throughput and deficiency agreement with BP Products for transporting diluent on Diamondback under a joint tariff agreement with a third-party carrier that contains minimum volume requirements. In connection with the IPO, we entered into additional throughput and deficiency agreements that contain minimum volume requirements with BP Products for each of our three Wholly Owned Assets. See Note 8 - Related Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details.\nContribution of Interests in Investments\nImmediately prior to the consummation of the IPO, BP Pipelines contributed to us 28.5% ownership interest in Mars and 20% managing member interest in Mardi Gras. We control and consolidate Mardi Gras via an agreement between us and our Parent, under which we have the right to vote 100% of Mardi Gras' ownership interests in each of the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures. Historical Predecessor results of operations consist of only the Predecessor Assets.\nExpenses\nOur Predecessor's operating and general and administrative expenses included direct charges for the management and operations of our assets and certain general corporate overhead, shared services and operating services allocated to us by BP Pipelines through October 29, 2017. These allocated expenses included but were not limited to finance, accounting, treasury, legal, information technology, human resources, shared services, government affairs, insurance, health, safety, security, employee benefits, incentives, severance and environmental functional support. These expenses were charged or allocated to our Predecessor Assets based on the nature of the expenses.\nSubsequent to the IPO, BP Pipelines charges us a combination of fixed and reimbursable charges for administrative and operating services under our omnibus agreement. We pay an annual fee, initially $13.3 million, to BP Pipelines for general and administrative services. The omnibus fee is structured to support all of our onshore and offshore assets, while the expenses allocated to the Predecessor only covered the Wholly Owned Assets.\nWe have begun incurring incremental general and administrative expenses attributable to being a publicly traded partnership. Such expenses include but are not limited to expenses associated with periodic reporting with the SEC, tax return and Schedule K-1 preparation and distribution, NYSE listing, independent auditor fees, legal fees, investor relations expenses, transfer agent and registrar fees, outside director fees and compensation expense associated with the long-term incentive plan.\nIncome Taxes\nFederal income taxes were reflected on the historical financial statements of our Predecessor. The Partnership is a pass-through entity for federal and state income tax purposes and is not subject to federal and state income tax expense in its financial results.\nFinancing\nThere are differences in the way we finance our operations as compared to the way our Predecessor historically financed its operations. Historically, our Predecessor's operations were financed as part of BP Pipelines' integrated operations, and our Predecessor did not record any separate costs associated with financing its operations. Our Predecessor largely relied on internally-generated cash flows and capital contributions from BP Pipelines to satisfy its capital expenditure requirements. Subsequent to the IPO, we expect to fund future capital expenditures primarily from external sources, including borrowings under our $600.0 million revolving credit facility and potential future issuances of equity and debt securities.\nWe intend to make cash distributions to our unitholders at a minimum distribution rate of $0.2625 per unit per quarter ($1.05 per unit on an annualized basis). Based on the terms of our cash distribution policy, we expect that we will distribute to our unitholders and our general partner, as the holder of our incentive distribution rights, most of the cash generated by our operations.\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nOur business can be negatively affected by sustained downturns or slow growth in the economy in general, and is impacted by shifts in supply and demand dynamics, the mix of services requested by the customers of our pipelines, competition and changes in regulatory requirements affecting our customers' operations.\nWe believe the key factors that impact our business are the supply of and/or demand for crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent in the markets in which our business operates.\nWe also believe that our customers' requirements and government regulation of crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent pipeline systems, discussed in more detail below, play an important role in how we manage our operations and implement our long-term strategies.\nChanges in Crude Oil and Natural Gas Sourcing and Refined Product and Diluent Demand Dynamics\nTo effectively manage our business, we monitor our market areas for both short-term and long-term shifts in crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent supply and demand. Changes in crude oil and natural gas supply such as new discoveries of reserves, declining production in older fields and the introduction of new sources of crude oil and natural gas supply, investment programs of our shippers to maintain or increase production, along with global supply and demand fundamentals such as the strength of the U.S. dollar, weather conditions and competition among oil producing countries for market share, affect the demand for our services from both producers and consumers. One of the strategic advantages of our crude oil pipeline system is its ability to transport attractively priced crude oil from multiple supply sources. Our crude oil shippers periodically change the relative mix of crude oil grades delivered to the refineries and markets served by our pipelines. While these changes in the sourcing patterns of crude oil transported are reflected in changes in the relative volumes of crude oil by type handled by our pipelines, our crude oil transportation revenue is primarily affected by changes in overall crude oil supply and demand dynamics.\nSimilarly, our refined products pipeline system has the ability to serve multiple demand centers. Our refined products shippers periodically change the relative mix of refined products shipped on our refined products pipeline system, as well as the destination points, based on changes in pricing and demand dynamics. While these changes in shipping patterns are reflected in relative types of refined products handled by our pipeline, our total product transportation revenue is primarily affected by changes in overall refined products and diluent supply and demand dynamics.\nFurther, the volumes of crude oil that we transport on our BP2 system and refined products and diluent that we distribute on our River Rouge and Diamondback systems depend substantially on the economics of available crude supply for the Whiting Refinery and the economics for refined products and diluent demand in the markets that the pipelines serve. These economics are affected by numerous factors beyond our control.\nAs these supply and demand dynamics shift, we anticipate that we will continue to actively pursue projects that link new sources of supply to producers and consumers. Similarly, as demand dynamics change, we anticipate that we will create new services or capacity arrangements that meet customer requirements.\nChanges in Commodity Prices\nWe do not engage in the marketing and trading of any commodities. We do not take ownership of crude oil, natural gas, refined products or diluent. As a result, our exposure to commodity price fluctuations is limited to the FLA provisions in our tariffs, which are only applicable to our crude oil pipelines. We also have indirect exposure to commodity price fluctuations to the extent such fluctuations affect the shipping patterns of our customers.\nMajor Expansion Projects\nWe currently have one major expansion project planned in 2018. An affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell plc (\"Shell\") is currently building the Mattox pipeline, which will connect to Proteus for the mutual benefit of all parties involved. Through this upstream connection, Proteus will transport all of the volumes from Shell's recently sanctioned Appomattox platform. Proteus is also constructing a new connecting platform adjacent to South Pass 89E platform that will accommodate volumes from the Mattox pipeline. In addition, the new Proteus platform will provide space for future pumping equipment and the ability to increase the capacity of the Proteus system to over 700 kbpd.\nThe total project cost is expected to be approximately $345.0 million from 2015 to 2019, which are fully reimbursable to Proteus from third-party investors that are not affiliated with the Partnership. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Proteus incurred $147.3 million of capitalized costs. We expect the Appomattox expansion capital expenditures to be approximately $119.8 million in 2018.\nCustomers\nBP is our primary customer. Transportation revenue from BP represented 97.6%, 94.4%, and 93.8% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. BP's volumes represented approximately 97.4%, 95.2% and 95.3% of the aggregate total volumes transported on the Wholly Owned Assets for the period from January 1, 2017 through October 29, 2017, and the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. BP's volumes represented approximately 54.5% of the aggregate total volumes transported on the Wholly Owned Assets, Mars and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures combined for the period from October 30, 2017 through December 31, 2017.\nIn addition, we transport crude oil, natural gas and diluent for a mix of third-party customers, including crude oil producers, refiners, marketers and traders, and our assets are connected to other crude oil, natural gas and diluent pipeline systems. In addition to serving directly connected Midwestern U.S. and Gulf Coast markets, our pipelines have access to customers in various regions of the United States and Canada through interconnections with other major pipelines. Our customers use our transportation services for a variety of reasons. Producers of crude oil require the ability to deliver their product to market and frequently enter into firm transportation contracts to ensure that they will have sufficient capacity available to deliver their product to delivery points with greatest market liquidity. Marketers and traders generate income from buying and selling crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent to capitalize on price differentials over time or between markets. Our customer mix can vary over time and largely depends on the crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent supply and demand dynamics in our markets.\nCompetition\nOur pipelines face competition from a variety of alternative transportation methods including rail, water borne movements including barging and shipping, trucking and other pipelines that service the same markets as our pipelines. Competition for BP2 and River Rouge common carrier pipelines is based primarily on connectivity to sources of supply and demand, while Diamondback faces competition for Gulf Coast sourced diluent from third-party pipelines, which have made direct connections at Manhattan, Illinois. Our offshore pipelines compete for new production on the basis of geographic proximity to the production, cost of connection, available capacity, transportation rates and access to onshore markets.\nRegulation\nOur interstate common carrier pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies including the FERC, Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and the Department of Transportation (\"DOT\"). For more information on federal, state and local regulations affecting our business, please read Part I, Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties within this report.\nAcquisition Opportunities\nWe plan to pursue acquisitions of complementary assets from BP as well as third parties. We also may pursue acquisitions jointly with BP Pipelines. BP Pipelines has granted us a right of first offer with respect to its retained ownership interest in Mardi Gras and all of its interests in midstream pipeline systems and assets related thereto in the contiguous United States and offshore Gulf of Mexico that were owned by BP Pipelines at the closing of the IPO. Neither BP nor any of its affiliates are under any obligation, however, to sell or offer to sell us additional assets or to pursue acquisitions jointly with us, and we are under no obligation to buy any additional assets from them or to pursue any joint acquisitions with them. We will focus our acquisition strategy on transportation and midstream assets within the crude oil, natural gas and refined products sectors. We believe that we are well positioned to acquire midstream assets from BP, and particularly BP Pipelines, as well as third parties, should such opportunities arise. Identifying and executing acquisitions will be a key part of our strategy. However, if we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, our future growth will be limited, and the acquisitions we do make may reduce, rather than increase, our available cash.\nSeasonality\nThe volumes of crude oil, refined products and diluent transported in our pipelines are directly affected by the level of supply and demand for such commodities in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. However, many effects of seasonality on our revenue will be substantially mitigated through the use of our fee-based long-term agreements with BP Products that include minimum volume commitments.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables and discussion contain a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. For periods prior the closing of our IPO, all financial data included in this section of the report reflect the results of our Predecessor for accounting purposes. For the period subsequent to the closing of the IPO (i.e., October 30, 2017 through December 31, 2017), the financial data reflect the results of the Partnership.\n\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nTotal revenue increased by $5.1 million, or 5%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to (i) a $9.8 million increase in throughput revenue from BP2 resulting from a 21.8% increase in throughput volume, (ii) a $3.2 million increase in FLA revenue from BP2, and (iii) a $0.8 million increase in deficiency revenue from our throughput and deficiency agreements with BP which were effective upon the IPO. The increase in throughput volume at BP2 during the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to a lower level of maintenance activities performed on Whiting Refinery equipment during this period, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The overall increase in revenue was partially offset by (i) a $7.5 million decrease in throughput revenue at Diamondback due to a 31.9% reduction in throughput volume primarily driven by lower Whiting Refinery diluent production, (ii) a $0.6 million decrease in throughput revenue at River Rouge, and (iii) a $0.6 million decrease in revenue from reimbursable projects at BP2.\nOperating expenses increased by $2.0 million, or 14.3%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to (i) a $1.1 million increase in insurance expense caused by a higher internal allocation from the Parent prior to the IPO in 2017 compared with 2016 and a higher insurance premium covering the Wholly Owned Assets, Mars, and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures subsequent to the IPO, and (ii) a $0.8 million increase in electricity expense results from an increase in throughput volumes at BP2 and higher electrical usage due to pump and motor constraints at River Rouge during 2017.\nMaintenance expenses increased by $2.0 million, or 67.9%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of increased maintenance project activities primarily related to River Rouge, including in-line inspections and repairs emanating from the in-line inspections. In-line inspections started in the fourth quarter of 2016 and incurred cost of $2.7 million in 2017. This increase was partially offset by the costs incurred by the River Rouge projects completed in 2016, such as casing test station installations at fourteen sites and cathodic protection maintenance required from the annual survey, which incurred total project costs of $0.8 million in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $0.6 million, or 7.3%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Prior to the IPO, general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of expenses allocated\nfrom the Parent. Subsequent to the IPO, general and administrative expenses primary consist of a fixed fee of $13.3 million per year under an omnibus agreement that we entered into with our Parent in connection with the IPO and additional costs incurred as a result of being a publicly traded partnership.\nDepreciation expense remained relatively flat at $2.7 million and $2.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nProperty and other tax expense remained flat at $0.4 million in both of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nIncome from equity method investments was $17.9 million in 2017 due to earnings from Mars and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures from October 30, 2017 through December 31, 2017, after they were contributed to us in connection with the IPO.\nOther income was less than $0.1 million and $0.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Other income represents the changes in fair value of the embedded derivative associated with the allowance oil receivable incurred prior to October 1, 2017. Pursuant to a related party agreement, allowance oil receivable incurred on and after October 1, 2017 is settled at the commodity prices of the movement month and no longer contains an embedded derivative that would result in gain and losses due to changes in fair value.\nInterest expense, net was $0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. In connection with the IPO, we entered into a $600.0 million revolving credit facility agreement. The $0.1 million of net interest consisted of interest expense and commitment and utilization fees, which were partially offset by interest income on cash deposits held by BPMP.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $4.1 million, or 14.1%, due to a change in tax status upon completion of the IPO. Prior to the IPO, the Predecessor was included in the consolidated income tax returns of our Parent which is subject to federal and state income taxes. The effective tax rate during the period ended October 29, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016, remained consistent at 39.1%. Subsequent to the IPO, the Partnership is treated as a pass-through entity for federal and state income tax purposes. There is no federal and state income taxes for the period subsequent the IPO.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nTotal revenue decreased by $3.8 million, or 3.5%, primarily due to activity from our BP2 pipeline, including a $4.6 million reduction from volumes and a $1.8 million decrease in FLA revenue in 2016 that were partially offset by a 1.3% increase in BP2's average pipeline tariff. Throughput volumes for BP2 decreased by 10.1%, primarily because the Whiting Refinery completed a significant scheduled turnaround, which occurred periodically, in 2016. The revenue decrease was partially offset by a $1.9 million revenue increase from Diamondback due to a 0.8% throughput volumes increase and by a $0.7 million revenue increase in River Rouge due a 2.2% average tariff increase.\nOperating expenses decreased in 2016 by $0.3 million, or 2.2%, primarily as a result of a reduction of insurance costs of $1.7 million and lower variable power costs of $0.3 million partially offset by increased environmental remediation accrual costs of $1.3 million, increased chemical costs of $0.3 million and an increase in other costs of $0.1 million. Insurance costs decreased due to a restructuring of the insurance program and the rates charged by insurers. Power costs decreased due to decreased throughput volume, in addition to drag reducing agents (\"DRA\") being added to River Rouge. The environmental remediation accrual costs increased due to a revision in our environmental liabilities. The increased chemical costs resulted from the cost to purchase the DRA for River Rouge.\nMaintenance expenses decreased in 2016 by $0.9 million, or 23.8%, as a result of decreased project costs. Project costs decreased primarily due to the completion of larger projects during 2015, including relocating a portion of River Rouge to maintain right of way status and the completion of a potential leak investigation.\nGeneral and administrative expense remained relatively flat year over year. General and administrative expenses consisted of expenses allocated by our Parent.\nDepreciation expense was $2.6 million in 2016 as compared with $2.5 million in 2015.\nProperty and other tax expense remained relatively flat year over year.\nOther income (loss) was $0.5 million and $(0.6) million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other income (loss) represented the changes in fair value in earnings related to the embedded derivative within the allowance oil receivable.\nIncome tax expense remained relatively flat year over year.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income and to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, for each of the periods indicated.\n\n\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nHistorically, our sources of liquidity included cash generated from operations and funding from BP Pipelines. Prior to the IPO, we participated in BP Pipelines' centralized cash management system; therefore, our cash receipts were deposited in BP Pipelines' or its affiliates' bank accounts, all cash disbursements were made from those accounts, and we maintained no bank accounts dedicated solely to our assets. Thus, historically our financial statements have reflected no cash balances prior to the IPO.\nFollowing the IPO, we maintain separate bank accounts, and BP Pipelines continues to provide treasury services on our General Partner's behalf under our omnibus agreement. We expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations (including distribution from our equity method investments), borrowings under our revolving credit facility and issuances of debt and additional equity securities. The entities in which we own an interest may also incur debt. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term working capital requirements and long-term capital expenditure requirements and to make quarterly cash distributions.\nThe board of directors of our general partner has adopted a cash distribution policy pursuant to which we intend to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2625 per unit per quarter, which equates to approximately $27.5 million per quarter, or approximately $110.0 million per year in the aggregate, based on the number of common and subordinated units currently outstanding. We intend to pay such distributions to the extent we have sufficient cash after the establishment of cash reserves and the payment of our expenses, including payments to our general partner and its affiliates.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn October 30, 2017, the Partnership entered into a $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the credit facility\u201d) with an affiliate of BP. The credit facility terminates on October 30, 2022 and provides for certain covenants, including the requirement to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio, which is calculated as total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit facility), not to exceed 5.0 to 1.0, subject to a temporary increase in such ratio to 5.5 to 1.0 in connection with certain material acquisitions. In addition, the limited liability company agreement of our General Partner requires the approval of BP Holdco prior to the incurrence of any indebtedness that would cause our leverage ratio to exceed 4.5 to 1.0.\nThe credit facility also contains customary events of default, such as (i) nonpayment of principal when due, (ii) nonpayment of interest, fees or other amounts, (iii) breach of covenants, (iv) misrepresentation, (v) cross-payment default and cross-acceleration (in each case, to indebtedness in excess of $75.0 million) and (vi) insolvency. Additionally, the credit facility limits our ability to, among other things: (i) incur or guarantee additional debt, (ii) redeem or repurchase units or make distributions under certain circumstances; and (iii) incur certain liens or permit them to exist. Indebtedness under this facility bears interest at the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") plus 0.85%. This facility includes customary fees, including a commitment fee of 0.10% and a utilization fee of 0.20%. At December 31, 2017, $15.0 million was drawn and outstanding from the credit facility.\nCash Flows from Our Operations\nOperating Activities. We generated $69.2 million in cash flow from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the $49.8 million generated in the year ended December 31, 2016. The $19.4 million increase in cash flows from operations primarily resulted from an increase in net income attributed to the Wholly Owned Assets and the distributions from equity method investments that were contributed to us in connection with the IPO. The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease resulted from changes in operating assets and liabilities position primarily in accounts receivable from related parties.\nOur Predecessor generated $49.8 million in cash flow from operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $48.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to a change in accounts receivable position from both third and related parties in addition to an increase in accounts payable to third parties partially offset by a decrease resulting from a change in the allowance oil receivable position.\nInvesting Activities. Our cash flow generated by investing activities was $5.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $3.4 million used in the year ended December 31, 2016. The $8.4 million increase in cash flow used in investing activities is due to the post-IPO distribution in excess of earnings received from equity method investments and a decrease in capital expenditures on maintenance projects during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOur Predecessor's cash flow used in investing activities was $3.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $0.7 million used in the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in cash flow used in investing activities is due to increased cash paid for capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities. Our cash flow used in financing activities was $41.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $46.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we distributed $814.4 million of the $814.7 million net proceeds that we received from the IPO to our Parent with the remaining $0.3 million recorded in Accounts payable - related parties on the consolidated balance sheets. We also distributed $9.4 million of dividends to the prior owners of Mars and Mardi Gras, which were prorated for the fourth quarter period prior to the IPO. An additional $9.5 million was distributed to our Parent for its noncontrolling interests in Mardi Gras.\nPrior to October 30, 2017, all of our Predecessor's cash flow was advanced through BP Pipelines' centralized cash management system. Net cash used in financing activities prior to the IPO was $37.8 million for 2017, compared to $46.4 million in 2016, both of which were transfers to BP Pipelines. The use of cash in 2017 was partially offset by a $15.0 million draw from the credit facility after the IPO.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $46.4 million for 2016 compared to $47.5 million in 2015, both of which were transfers to BP Pipelines. The decrease in transfers resulted from a decrease in net income year over year.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur operations can be capital intensive, requiring investment to expand, upgrade or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. Our capital requirements consist of Maintenance Capital Expenditures and Expansion Capital Expenditures, both as defined in our partnership agreement. We are required to distinguish between Maintenance Capital\nExpenditures and Expansion Capital Expenditures in accordance with our partnership agreement, even though historically we did not make a distinction between Maintenance Capital Expenditures and Expansion Capital Expenditures in exactly the same way as is required under our partnership agreement.\nA summary of our capital expenditures, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, is shown in the table below:\n\nOur capital expenditures for 2017 were $1.0 million, primarily associated with the following projects:\n \u2022 Continuation of leak detection metering upgrades for BP2; and \n \u2022 Replacement and installation of new transformer at Ann Arbor station for River Rouge \nOur capital expenditures for 2016 were $4.0 million, primarily associated with the following projects:\n \u2022 Leak detection metering upgrades for BP2; \n \u2022 Relief valve redesign implementation at South Bend station for River Rouge; and \n \u2022 Continuation of installation of DRA at five stations for River Rouge \nOur capital expenditures for 2015 were $1.3 million, primarily associated with the following projects:\n \u2022 Installation of DRA at five stations for River Rouge; and \n \u2022 Relief valve redesign implementation at South Bend station for River Rouge \nAll of our capital expenditures in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were maintenance expenditures. We did not incur any expansion capital expenditures during such periods.\nWe expect maintenance capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 million for the year ending December 31, 2018, which will primarily be related to regulatory and asset integrity projects.\nWe anticipate that our 2018 maintenance capital expenditures will be funded with cash from operations and our borrowings under the credit facility.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017, is shown in the table below:\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions. We have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the Partnership and related notes thereto and believe those policies are reasonable and appropriate.\nWe apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with GAAP. Our more critical accounting policies include those related to revenue recognition, allowance oil, and environmental and legal obligations. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates. We periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are primarily generated from crude oil, refined products and diluent transportation services. In general, we recognize revenue from customers when all of the following criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the price is fixed or determinable and allocated to the performance obligations in the contract; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.\nDuring the second half of 2017, we entered into multiple long-term fee-based transportation agreements with BP Products, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BP. Under these agreements, BP Products has committed to pay us the minimum volumes at the applicable rates for each of the twelve-month measurement periods specified by the applicable agreements whether or not such volumes are physically transported through our pipelines. BP Products is allowed to make up for shortfall volumes during each of the measurement periods.\nContracts with BP Products, including the allowance oil arrangements discussed below, are accounted for as separate arrangements because they do not meet the criteria for combination. We record revenue for crude oil, refined products and diluent transportation over the period in which they are earned (i.e., either physical delivery of product has taken place, or the services designated in the contract have been performed). Revenue from transportation services is recognized upon delivery based on contractual rates related to throughput volumes. We accrue revenue based on services rendered but not billed for that accounting month.\nBillings to BP Products for deficiency volumes under its minimum volume commitments, if any, are recorded in Accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, as BP Products has the right to make up the deficiency volumes within the measurement period specified by the agreements. The deferred balance is recognized in revenue when the make-up rights contractually expire or when the uncertainty around the possibility to make up for the shortfall diminishes, whichever is earlier.\nAllowance Oil\nOur tariff for crude oil transportation at BP2 includes an FLA. An FLA factor per barrel, a fixed percentage, is a separate fee under the applicable crude oil tariff to cover evaporation and other loss in transit. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, all of our revenue at BP2 was generated from services to our Parent.\nAs crude oil is transported, we earn additional income based on the applicable FLA factor and the volume transported by our Parent measured at the receipt location. We do not take physical possession of the allowance oil as a result of our services, but record the value of the volumes accumulated as a receivable from our Parent. We recognize the FLA income in Revenue-related parties on the consolidated statements of operations during the periods when commodities are transported. The amount of revenue recognized is a product of the quantity transported, the applicable FLA factor and the settlement price during the month the product is transported. We cash settle allowance oil receivable with our Parent in the subsequent periods after the transportation service has been performed. The settlement payment is a product of the quantity settled and the applicable settlement price per unit. Once\nthe settlement price is known, we reclassify the balance out of Allowance oil receivable and accrue it in Accounts receivable - related parties on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe settlement price for volumes accumulated prior to October 1, 2017 was a summation of the calendar-month average of West Texas Intermediate ( WTI\u201d) on the New York Mercantile Exchange and a differential provided by our Parent. The differential represents the difference in market price between WTI and the type of allowance oil to be settled and the difference in market price between the settlement month and the month prior to settlement. The fluctuation in commodity prices between the month of movement and the month of settlement resulted in an embedded derivative, which we measured along with the allowance oil receivable in their entirety at fair value because the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative were clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host arrangement. The allowance oil volumes accumulated prior to October 1, 2017 were entirely settled upon October 30, 2017. While such volumes were outstanding, we recognized the changes in their fair value in Other income (loss) on the consolidated statements of operations. The embedded derivative was not designated as a hedging instrument.\nThe settlement price for volumes accumulated on and after October 1, 2017 is determined using the same equation as the prior periods but with pricing input from the month of movement, instead of the month of settlement, pursuant to a related party agreement that we entered into with our affiliate. The settlement price is fixed and determinable upon the completion of transportation. As a result, the allowance oil balances at December 31, 2017 and onward no longer contain a derivative feature or result in a gain or loss related to the change in its fair value. We now settle the allowance oil at the end of each period; therefore, the balances are entirely recorded in Accounts receivable - related parties after October 1, 2017.\nLegal\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as the result of our business operations and transactions. We utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders, judgments or settlements. In general, we expense legal costs as incurred. When we identify specific litigation that is expected to continue for a significant period of time, is reasonably possible to occur and may require substantial expenditures, we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to litigate the matter to a conclusion or reach an acceptable settlement, and we accrue for the lower end of the range. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates, or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings will be affected.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws require us to take future action to remediate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemicals or petroleum substances by us or other parties. Environmental expenditures that are required to obtain future economic benefits from its assets are capitalized as part of those assets. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future earnings shall be expensed, unless already provisioned for, which then shall be charged against provisions.\nProvisions are recognized when we have a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event. It is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. We do not discount environmental liabilities, and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable, and when we can reasonably estimate the costs. In making environmental liability estimations, we consider the material effect of environmental compliance, pending legal actions against us and potential third-party liability claims. Often, as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses, additional information is obtained, requiring revisions to estimated costs. These revisions are reflected in our income in the year in which they are probable and reasonably estimable.\nGenerally, our recording of these provisions coincides with our commitment to a formal plan of action, or if earlier, on the closure or divestment of inactive sites. We recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable. The ultimate requirement for remediation and its cost are inherently difficult to estimate. We believe that the outcome of these uncertainties should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, or operating results.\nOur existing environmental conditions prior to the IPO are obligations contributed to us by the prior operator of these facilities, BP Pipelines, who has agreed to indemnify us with respect to such conditions under the terms of an omnibus agreement that we entered into in connection with the IPO.", "item_7_tables": "Table 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands of dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholly Owned Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital expenditures\n</td> <td>2,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Wholly Owned Assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mars and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital expenditures\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Mars and the Mardi Gras Joint Ventures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Maintenance Spend\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>* Information is not applicable for the periods prior to the IPO.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Reflects the allocable portion of the maintenance expenses, maintenance capital expenditures and Total Maintenance Spend, as applicable, attributable to our 28.5% ownership interest in Mars and our 20% interest of the 56% ownership interest in Caesar, 53% interest in Cleopatra, 65% interest in Proteus and 65% interest in Endymion held by Mardi Gras.

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A), highlighting key aspects of their financial performance prior to and after their Initial Public Offering (IPO) on October 30, 2017.\n\nThe Partnership, which operates pipelines and midstream assets, underwent an IPO which involved the sale of common units to public unitholders, generating net proceeds of $814.7 million after deductions. Prior to the IPO, BP Pipelines contributed several significant assets to the Partnership, resulting in the Partnership receiving interests in various pipeline entities.\n\nThe financial review emphasizes the importance of the IPO and the contribution of assets from BP Pipelines to the Partnership. This includes full ownership of certain pipeline systems, and percentage interests in entities such as Mars Oil Pipeline Company LLC and Mardi Gras Transportation System Company LLC. In exchange, BP Pipelines received common and subordinated units, a non-economic general partner interest, incentive distribution rights, and cash distributions.\n\nPost-IPO, the Partnership entered into throughput and deficiency agreements with BP Products North America Inc., ensuring minimum volume commitments for transportation of diluent on their pipelines.\n\nThe report also covers the revenue generation from both onshore and offshore assets. For onshore assets, revenue is based on tariffs applied to volumes moved, and prior to July 1, 2017, there were no long-term fee-based transportation agreements except for two on Diamondback. For offshore assets, many contracts include life-of-lease transportation dedications with producers but do not necessarily have a minimum volume commitment.\n\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are also discussed, detailing the standards for revenue recognition, allowance oil, and legal and environmental provisions. The report states that legal costs are expensed as incurred and environmental liabilities are recorded when estimable and probable, indicating BP Pipelines has indemnified the Partnership regarding pre-IPO environmental conditions.\n\nThe report concludes with insights into the Partnership's capital resources, liquidity, cash flows, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, and off-balance sheet arrangements. It sketches out that the cash from operations, borrowings under a credit facility, and issues of debt and equity securities are expected to be sufficient to meet future needs and distribute quarterly cash to unit holders. The future capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 million for 2018 are outlined, expected to fund regulatory and asset integrity projects.\n\nThis summary covers selective details, and reading the full MD&A, along with accompanying financial statements and footnotes, would provide a comprehensive understanding of the Partnership's financial position and operations."}
