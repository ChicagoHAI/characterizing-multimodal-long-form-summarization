With a broad, differentiated product portfolio that includes NOR flash memories, F-RAM\u2122 and SRAM, Traveo\u2122 microcontrollers, the industry's only PSoC\u00ae programmable system-on-chip solutions, analog and PMIC Power Management ICs, CapSense\u00ae capacitive touch-sensing controllers, and Wireless BLE Bluetooth Low-Energy and USB connectivity solutions, Cypress is committed to providing its customers worldwide with consistent innovation, best-in-class support and exceptional system value.\nMerger with Spansion\nOn March 12, 2015, we completed the merger ( Merger\u201d) with Spansion Inc. ( Spansion\u201d) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, as of December 1, 2014 (the Merger Agreement\u201d), for a total consideration of approximately $2.8 billion. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, Spansion shareholders received 2.457 Cypress shares for each Spansion share they owned. The Merger has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Topic 805, Business Combinations, with Cypress treated as the accounting acquirer. The post-Merger company is expected to realize more than $160 million in cost synergies on an annualized basis within two years, and create a leading global provider of microcontrollers and specialized memories needed in today's embedded systems.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes the financial results of legacy Spansion beginning March 12, 2015. The comparability of our operating results for the year ended January 3, 2016 to the same period in fiscal 2014 is significantly impacted by our Merger. In our discussion and analysis of comparative periods, we have quantified the contribution of additional revenue or expense resulting from this transaction wherever such amounts were material and identifiable. While identified amounts may provide indications of general trends, the analysis cannot completely address the effects attributable to integration efforts.\nDivestiture of TrueTouch\u00ae Business\nOn August 1, 2015, we completed the sale of the TrueTouch\u00ae mobile touchscreen business, which is a business unit within our Programmable Systems Division, to Parade Technologies ( Parade\u201d) for total cash proceeds of $98.6 million pursuant to the definitive agreement signed on June 11, 2015. Of the total cash proceeds, $10.0 million are held in an escrow account until January 2017 subject to any indemnity claims on post-closing adjustments, per the terms of the agreement. Post-sale, Cypress will continue to provide TrueTouch\u00ae solutions to its automotive, industrial and home appliance customers and to its mobile customers. In connection with the transaction, we sold certain assets associated with the disposed business mostly consisting of inventory with a net book value of $10.5 million and recognized a gain of $66.5 million in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2015. This gain has been presented as a separate line item Gain on divestiture of TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAlso in connection with the transaction, we entered into a Manufacturing Service Agreement (MSA) in which we agreed to sell finished wafers and devices to Parade during the one-year period following the close of the transaction. The terms of the MSA indicated that we would sell finished products to Parade at agreed-upon prices that were considered below fair market value, indicating that there was an embedded fair value that would be realized by Parade through those terms. Accordingly, we have allocated $19.9 million from the $98.6 million proceeds to the fair value of the MSA based on the forecasted wafer sales to Parade for the subsequent one-year period. Such amount was deferred on our consolidated balance sheet initially and is being amortized to revenue as we sell products to Parade. During the year ended January 3, 2016, we recognized $5.7 million of revenue from amortization of such deferred revenue.\nAs of the end of fiscal 2015, our organization included the following business segments:\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> Business Segments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Description\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PSD: Programmable Systems Division\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> PSD focuses on high-performance, programmable solutions.

With the addition of the legacy Spansion business, we plan to capitalize on our expanded product portfolio and leadership positions in embedded processing and specialized memories to significantly extend our penetration of global markets such as automotive, industrial, communications, consumer, computation, data communications, mobile handsets and military. Our revenue model is based on the following product and market strategies: (a) increasing market share in our memory products by leveraging our market position and expanding our portfolio with new and complementary products, (b) growing revenue from our high-performance, programmable solutions and derivatives including PSoC programmable system-on-chip products and microcontrollers in the automotive and industrial markets, (c) increasing our DCD revenue through the introduction of new products such as USB Type-C solutions, SuperSpeed USB 3.0 peripheral controllers and Bluetooth\u00ae Low Energy solutions that leverage Cypress's PRoC\u2122 programmable radio-on-chip technology for the IoT and other applications, and (d) revenue growth from ETD, which includes our internal startup companies. For profitability, our focus is to integrate the acquired Spansion business successfully and realize the anticipated product cost and operational cost synergies. Our integration effort includes the re-focusing of portions of legacy Spansion business to higher-margin opportunities, particularly in the Flash memory business. We monitor our operating expenses closely to improve our operating leverage as driven by various company-wide initiatives, including our World Class Cost program to continuously reduce cost line items as well as a Human Resources effort to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency across the company.\nIn order to achieve our goals on revenue growth and profitability, Cypress will continue to pursue the following strategies:\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Successfully integrate our business with Spansion.

Some of these factors are discussed under Item 1A.\nManufacturing Strategy\nOur core manufacturing strategy-\u201dflexible manufacturing\u201d-combines capacity from foundries with output from our internal manufacturing facilities. This strategy is intended to allow us to meet rapid swings in customer demand while lessening the burden of high fixed costs, a capability that is particularly important in high-volume consumer markets that we serve with our leading programmable product portfolio.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenues\nOur total revenues increased by $882.4 million or 121.6% to $1,607.9 million for the year ended January 3, 2016 compared to the prior year. For the year ended January 3, 2016, $962.3 million of the increase was attributable to revenue contributions from the acquired Spansion business which is included in the PSD and MPD divisions. The overall increase was partially offset by decrease in revenue from TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business as a result of divestiture of the business on August 1, 2015. The overall average selling price of our products, including Spansion products, for the year ended January 3, 2016 was $1.09. Excluding Spansion products, our ASP for the year ended January 3, 2016 was $1.14, which increased by $0.05 compared with the same period in the prior year.\nThe Company operates on a 52 or 53 week year ending on the Sunday nearest to December 31. Fiscal 2014 and 2013 were each 52 weeks and fiscal 2015 was a 53-week year, with the extra week in the fourth fiscal quarter. The additional week in 2015 did not materially affect the Company's results of operations or financial position.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, moderate pricing pressure in certain product lines, primarily due to competitive conditions. We have in the past been able to, and expect in the future to be able to, moderate average selling price declines in our product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices. We may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nConsistent with our accounting policies and generally accepted accounting principles, we have historically recognized a significant portion of revenue through distributors at the time the distributor resold the product to its end customer (also referred to as the sell-through basis of revenue recognition) given the difficulty in estimating the ultimate price of these product shipments and amount of potential returns. We continually reassess our ability to reliably estimate the ultimate price of these products and, over the past several years, we have made investments in our systems and processes around our distribution channel to improve the quality of the information we receive from our distributors. Given these ongoing investments, and based on the financial framework we use for estimating potential price adjustments, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, we concluded that we have become able to reasonably estimate returns and pricing concessions on certain product families and with certain distributors, and recognized revenue at the time we shipped these specific products to the identified distributors, less our estimate of future price adjustments and returns. During the year ended January 3, 2016, we recognized an incremental $40.9 million of revenue on additional product families for which revenue was previously recognized on a sell-through basis as we determined that we could reasonably estimate returns and pricing concessions at the time of shipment to distributors. This change resulted in a decrease to the net loss of $25.0 million for the year ended January 3, 2016 or $0.07 per basic and diluted share.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated revenues by segments:\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Programmable Systems Division\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 613,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 283,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 292,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Memory Products Division\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 871,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 347,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 338,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data Communications Division\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Emerging Technologies and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,607,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 725,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 722,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProgrammable Systems Division:\nRevenues from the Programmable Systems Division in fiscal 2015 increased by $330.7 million or 116.8% compared to fiscal 2014. The increase in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the $402.3 million of revenue contribution from the Spansion microcontroller and analog business for fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact of Spansion revenues, PSD decreased by $71.6 million for fiscal 2015, or 25.3%, compared to the prior year primarily due to weakness in our end customers' handset/mobile business demand, decrease in revenue from TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business as a result of divestiture of the business on August 1, 2015 and incremental revenue in fiscal 2014 as a result of the change in accounting for certain distributor revenues. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of PSD products to the automotive applications, where we experienced a ramp in volume from recent design wins.\nRevenues from the Programmable Systems Division in fiscal 2014 decreased by $9.5 million or 3.2% compared to fiscal 2013. The revenue decrease in fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to declines in sales of our TrueTouch\u00ae touchscreen products due to a decrease in revenue from our handset customers and lower average selling prices. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of PSD products to industrial and automotive customers where we experienced a ramp in volume from new design wins. Fiscal 2014 revenue also included $8.2 million of incremental revenue as a result of the change in accounting for certain distributor revenues as discussed above.\nMemory Products Division:\nRevenues from the Memory Products Division increased in fiscal 2015 by $523.8 million or 150.6% compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to $560.0 million of revenue contribution from the Spansion flash memory business for fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact of Spansion revenues, MPD decreased by $36.2 million or 10.4% in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year primarily driven by sales decrease in the communication market segment.\nRevenues from the Memory Products Division in fiscal 2014 increased by $8.9 million or 2.6% as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to an increase in sales of nonvolatile products associated with our acquisition of Ramtron in fiscal 2012, offset by a decrease in SRAM products driven by a continuing decrease in demand from wireless and wireline end customers. Fiscal 2014 revenue also included $4.1 million of incremental revenue as a result of the change in accounting for certain distributor revenues as discussed above.\nData Communications Division:\nRevenue for the Data Communication Division in fiscal 2015 increased by $2.4 million or 3.4% compared to fiscal 2014 due to increasing revenue in our super speed USB products, offset by a decline in our trackpad products..\nRevenue for the Data Communication Division in fiscal 2014 decreased by $9.0 million or 11.4% compared to fiscal 2013 due to declining revenue in our legacy high-speed USB controllers, optical navigation and trackpad products.\nEmerging Technologies and Other:\nRevenues from the Emerging Technologies Division increased by $25.5 million or 106.2% in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to the overall increase in demand at all of our Emerging Technologies companies. The increase was also attributable to increase in our Foundry revenues as we began selling products to Parade Technologies in August 2015 under the Manufacturing Services Agreement, which was signed in connection with our disposition of TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business.\nRevenue from the Emerging Technologies Division in fiscal 2014 increased by $12.4 million or 107.3% compared to fiscal 2013 due to increased revenue in all three business - Deca Tech, Agiga Tech and our foundry business. The increase is due to the overall increase in demand as certain of our Emerging Technologies companies begin to ramp production with new customer design wins.\nCost of Revenues/Gross Margin\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,207,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 361,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 384,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross margin consists of Revenues less Cost of revenues, and gross margin percentage is percentage of gross margin to revenue. Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on factors such as the mix of types of products sold and the impact of changes to inventory provisions, such as the write-down of inventory. Our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell, which is often difficult to estimate with accuracy. Therefore, if we achieve significant revenue growth in our lower margin product lines, or if we are unable to earn as much revenue as we expect from higher margin product lines, our gross margin may be negatively impacted.\nGross margin percentage declined to 24.9% in fiscal 2015 from 50.1% in fiscal 2014. The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to impact of the merger with Spansion, which historically had lower gross margins than Cypress, and $133.0 million of additional inventory reserves which were recorded on inventory assumed as a part of the Merger. The additional reserves on inventory were recognized as part of our strategy to focus on high margin, profitable business as a combined company. Total charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions, including reserves on inventory assumed as part of the Merger, totaled $152.5 million for fiscal 2015 and $19.8 million for fiscal 2014, unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 9.5% and 3.0%, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $6.4 million for fiscal 2015 and $3.7 million for fiscal 2014, favorably impacting our gross margin by 0.4% and 1.0%, respectively. Our gross margin for fiscal 2015 was also impacted by $84.4 million of amortization of fair value adjustments, net of reserves, relating to acquired legacy Spansion inventory.\nGross margin percentage increased to 50.1% in fiscal 2014 from 46.8% in fiscal 2013 primarily driven by lower cost of revenue expenses associated with the inventory acquired in the Ramtron acquisition, higher factory absorption and product and customer mix. Charges to cost of revenue for inventory reserve provisions were $19.8 million during fiscal 2014 and $12.8 million for fiscal 2013, unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 3% and 2%, respectively. The benefit realized from sales of inventory previously reserved were $3.7 million and $5.1 million for fiscal year 2014 and fiscal 2013, favorably impacting our gross margin by 1% and 1%, respectively.\nResearch and Development ( R&D\u201d)\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> R&D expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 281,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 164,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 190,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nR&D expenditures increased by $116.8 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was mainly attributable to $108.3 million of additional expenses due to the Merger, primarily comprised of $63.0 million of labor costs due to additional headcount, $24.0 million of building, repairs and other overhead expenses, $7.7 million of material costs on R&D projects, $8.5 million of professional services related to Information technology and other outside services and $9.5 million of increase in stock-based compensation expense.\nR&D expenditures decreased by $26.3 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $9.9 million in stock-based compensation and a decrease of $1.0 million in deferred compensation expense. There was an additional decrease in consulting fees and other outside services of $2.9 million and $10.0 million, respectively, as a result of a worldwide cost cutting effort. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses were lower in fiscal 2014 driven by the decrease in total expense in the same period.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d)\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SG&A expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 323,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 170,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 182,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSG&A expenses increased by $152.8 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was mainly due to $99.6 million of expenses from the Merger, primarily comprised of $50.0 million of labor costs due to additional headcount, $39.0 million of building, supplies, repairs and other overhead expenses, and $15.0 million of professional services expense related to information technology, legal and finance. Additionally, we also incurred $17.4 million of costs for professional fees for legal and audit services related to the Merger integration activities, $5.0M of termination costs on legacy Spansion patent license agreement and $30.6 million of increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to the 2015 PARS grants.\nSG&A expenses decreased by $11.9 million in fiscal 2014 or 6.5% compared to fiscal 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in stock-based compensation of $13.4 million, a $7.9 million decrease in headcount related expenditures, a $2.0 million decrease in deferred compensation expense, a $1.6 million decrease in variable bonus-related expense, offset by $7.3 million of acquisition related expenditures associated with our proposed merger with Spansion, an increase of $2.7 million in legal fees and $1.3 million in accrued estimated legal settlements.\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets\nDuring fiscal 2015, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets increased by $101.7 million compared to fiscal 2014. The increase is primarily due to the amortization on the intangibles acquired in connection with the Merger.\nDuring fiscal 2014, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets decreased by $1.1 million compared to fiscal 2013. The decrease is primarily related to certain intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2012 that were fully amortized during fiscal 2013.\nRestructuring\nIn March 2015, we began the implementation of planned cost reduction and restructuring activities in connection with the Merger. As part of this Spansion integration-related restructuring plan, we expect to eliminate approximately 1,000 positions from the combined workforce across all business and functional areas on a global basis. The restructuring charge of $90.1 million recorded for the year ended January 3, 2016 primarily consists of severance costs, lease termination costs and impairment of property, plant and equipment. The lease termination costs include approximately $18 million relating to the buildings Spansion had leased prior to the Merger, which we decided not to occupy in the post-Merger period. The initial term of the lease commenced on January 1, 2015 and will expire on December 31, 2026.\nThe following table summarizes the restructuring charges recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented pursuant to the Spansion Integration-Related Restructuring Plan:\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel costs\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease termination costs and other related charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total restructuring and other charges (benefit)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 90,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe anticipate that the remaining restructuring accrual balance will be paid out in cash through 2016 for employee terminations and over the remaining lease term through 2026 for the excess lease obligation.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we have realized approximately $137.7 million of synergy savings on an annualized basis from the restructuring actions taken. Upon completion of all of our actions, we anticipate our annualized synergy savings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to be approximately $160 million. When complete, we estimate approximately 40% of the savings will impact cost of goods sold and the remaining 60% will impact operating expenses. There can be no assurance that we will achieve these anticipated savings.\nGain on Divestiture of TruTouch\u00ae Mobile Business\nIn connection with the sale of the TrueTouch\u00ae mobile touchscreen business to Parade for total cash proceeds of $98.6 million, we sold certain assets associated with the disposed business mostly consisting of inventory with a net book value of $10.5 million and recognized a gain of $66.5 million in fiscal 2015, net of the amount of gain deferred in connection with an ongoing manufacturing service agreement we entered into with Parade in connection with the divestiture.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for fiscal 2015 was $16.4 million and represents accretion of interest expense on 2.00% Senior Exchangeable Notes, interest expense incurred on our revolving line of credit, Term Loan A and other debt.\nInterest expense for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 was $5.8 million and $8.1 million, respectively, and represents interest expense incurred on our revolving line of credit and other term debt.\nRefer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for more information about our credit facilities.\nOther Income (expense), Net\nThe following table summarizes the components of other income (expense), net:\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in fair value of investments under the deferred\ncompensation plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,354\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized loss on marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,655\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,495\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of equity investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Others\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (59\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,769\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEmployee Deferred Compensation Plan\nWe have a deferred compensation plan, which provides certain key employees, including our executive management, with the ability to defer the receipt of compensation in order to accumulate funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. We do not make contributions to the deferred compensation plan and we do not guarantee returns on the investments. Participant deferrals and investment gains and losses remain as our liabilities and the underlying assets are subject to claims of general creditors. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized changes in fair value of the assets under the deferred compensation plan in Other income (expense), net\u201d of $1.4 million of interest expense, $3.0 million and $6.4 million of interest income, respectively. The increase or decrease in the fair value of the investments relates to the increased or decreased performance of the portfolio on a year over year basis. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for more information about our deferred compensation plan.\nGain on Sale of Investments in Marketable Equity Securities\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we sold our investment in a certain marketable equity security for $2.2 million, which resulted in a realized gain of $1.1 million.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Ramtron, we recognized a gain of $1.7 million on our initial investment in Ramtron of $3.4 million. For more information about our acquisition, refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8.\nUnrealized loss on marketable securities\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased 6.9 million ordinary shares of Hua Hong Semiconductor Limited (HHSL) for an aggregate price of $10.0 million in connection with their initial public offering. HHSL is the parent company of Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, which is one of our strategic foundry partners. We recorded an unrealized loss on our investment in HHSL's ordinary shares of $4.7 million and $1.5 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, as a result of the decline in the fair market value of the investment.\nEquity in Net Loss of Equity Method Investee\nDuring fiscal 2015, we invested an additional $28.0 million in a battery company. The additional investment in this company increased our ownership interest in the company's outstanding stock from 26.2% as of December 28, 2014 to 38.7% as of January 3, 2016. We have accounted for our investment in this entity under the equity method of accounting since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, when we changed from the cost method of accounting to the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, we are required to record our interest in the investee's reported net income or loss for each reporting period. Additionally, we are required to present our prior period financial results to reflect the equity method of accounting from the date of the initial investment in the company. Our results of operations include charges of $7.1 million, $5.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013. Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for more detailed discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense was $16.9 million in fiscal 2015. Our income tax benefit was $1.2 million and $7.8 million for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. The tax expense for fiscal 2015 was primarily a result of non-U.S. income taxes on income earned in foreign jurisdictions. The tax benefit in fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to a release of previously accrued taxes of approximately $8.3 million related to settlements with taxing authorities and the lapsing of statutes of limitations, primarily offset by income taxes associated with our non-U.S. operations. The tax benefit in fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to a release of previously accrued taxes of approximately $13.8 million related to settlements with taxing authorities and the lapsing of statutes of limitation, primarily offset by income taxes associated with our non-U.S. operations.\nOur effective tax rate varies from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries taxed at different rates and a full valuation allowance on net operating losses incurred in the U.S. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. We regularly assess our tax positions in light of legislative, bilateral tax treaty, regulatory and judicial developments in the many countries in which we and our affiliates do business.\nNon-U.S. tax authorities have completed their income tax examinations of our subsidiary in Israel for fiscal years 2008-2013 and our branch in Germany for fiscal years 2010 to 2013. Both Israel and Germany examinations did not result in material adjustments to our tax liabilities. Income tax examinations of our Malaysian subsidiary for the fiscal years 2007 to 2012 and our Thailand subsidiary for fiscal year 2010 are in progress. We do not believe the ultimate outcome of these examinations will result in a material increase to our tax liability.\nInternational revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the U.S. at rates ranging from 0% to 25%. The impact on our provision for income taxes of foreign income being taxed at rates different than the U.S. federal statutory rate was an expense of approximately $22.4 million, and benefit of $37.5 million and $15.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates as compared to the U.S. statutory federal rate that had the most significant impact on our provision for foreign income taxes in the periods presented include the Cayman Islands, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand.\nOn July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. On February 19, 2016, the Internal Revenue Service appealed the decision. A final decision has yet to be issued. At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the status of the current regulations, questions related to the scope of potential impact, and the risk of the Tax Court's decision being overturned upon appeal, we have not recorded any impact related to this issue as of January 3, 2016.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and working capital:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 227,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 322,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Components of Cash Flows\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (79,087\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (42,156\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 193,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (43,453\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (45,023\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2015:\nOperating Activities\nIn fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $8.8 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $103.3 million in fiscal 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a net loss of $378.9 million adjusted for a net non-cash items of $293.6 million and a net cash provided by change in operating assets and liabilities of $96.4 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization of $243.8 million, stock based compensation expense of $93.5 million, non-cash restructuring charges of $8.6 million and, gain on the sale of our TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business of $66.5 million. The net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was due a decrease in inventories of $228.3 million offset by an increase in accounts receivables of $117.4 million, increase in other assets of $6.0 million, decrease in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities of $54.3 million and a decrease in deferred income of $14.2 million. The decrease in inventory was primarily due to $133.0 million of reserves recorded to write down inventory assumed from the Merger and was recognized as part of the Company's strategy to focus on high margin, profitable business as a combined company and to move away from the production and sale of inventory associated with non-strategic businesses.\nInvesting Activities\nIn fiscal 2015, we used $79.1 million of cash in our investing activities compared to $42.2 million in fiscal 2014. The cash we used in investing activities in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to $105.1 million in net cash paid on the Merger as part of purchase consideration, $47.2 million of cash used for property and equipment expenditures $28.0 million cash paid for equity investments and $6.1 million paid for a cost method investment. These increases were partially offset by $17.4 million of proceeds from the sales or maturities of investments and $98.6 million of cash proceeds from the sale of our TrueTouch\u00ae Mobile business, of the total cash proceeds received from the sale of our TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business, $10.0 million are held in an Escrow account until January 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nIn fiscal 2015, we generated $193.2 million of cash from our financing activities compared to $43.4 million in fiscal 2014. The cash we used in our financing activities in fiscal 2015 was primarily related our net borrowings on the revolving credit facility of $537.0 million, borrowings of $97.2 million on Term Loan A, net of costs, proceeds from settlement of capped calls which were assumed as part of the Merger of $25.3 million and net proceeds from the issuance of common shares under our employee stock plans of $52.3 million. The increases were offset by $315.0 million repayment of line of credit facility, $128.0 million of dividend payments, $55.1 million of repurchase of treasury stock and $9.6 million cash used for yield enhanced structured agreements settled in common stock.\nFiscal 2014:\nOperating Activities\nIn fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $103.3 million compared to $67.6 million in fiscal 2013. The increase in operating cash flows for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase in net income of $66.2 million compared to fiscal 2013. Our operating cash flow for 2014 of $103.3 million was primarily due to our net income of $16.5 million, net favorable non-cash adjustments to our net income including stock-based compensation of $50.2 million and depreciation and amortization of $46.7 million, and a net change in working capital of $15.7 million.\nInvesting Activities\nIn fiscal 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $42.2 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $0.3 million in fiscal 2013. The net cash used in our investing activities in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to investment purchases of $23.4 million, purchases of property and equipment of $20.9 million and investments made in other entities accounted for under the cost or equity method of accounting of $18.4 million, offset by the proceeds from sales of investments of $16.6 million.\nFinancing Activities\nIn fiscal 2014, net cash used in financing activities was $43.4 million compared to $45.0 million in fiscal 2013. The cash we used in our financing activities in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to payment of dividends of $69.2 million and the repayment of debt and obligations under capital leases of $6.3 million, offset by net proceeds of $32 million from the issuance of common shares under our employee stock plans.\nFiscal 2013:\nOperating Activities\nIn fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $67.6 million compared to $135 million in fiscal 2012. The decrease in operating cash flows for fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase in net loss of $24.8 million compared to fiscal 2012. Our operating cash flow for fiscal 2013 of $67.6 million was primarily due to our net loss of $50.1 million, offset by net favorable non-cash adjustments to our net loss including stock-based compensation of $73.0 million, depreciation and amortization of $48.4 million, and a net change in working capital of $20.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nIn fiscal 2013, net cash provided by investing activities was $0.3 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $113.0 million in fiscal 2012. The cash provided by our investing activities in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to sales of investments of $64.4 million offset by investment purchases of $23.1 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $36.6 million primarily for our Emerging Technologies Division.\nFinancing Activities\nIn fiscal 2013, net cash used in financing activities was $45.0 million compared to $58.5 million in fiscal 2012. The cash we used in our financing activities in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to payment of dividends of $64.8 million, repayment on our long term revolving credit facility (Credit facility) of $145.0 million and repayment of other debt of $17.1 million, partially offset by net proceeds of $38.7 million from the issuance of common shares under our employee stock plans, and borrowings of $140.0 million on our Credit facility.\nLiquidity and Contractual obligations\nStock Repurchase Programs:\nOn October 20, 2015, our Board authorized a new $450 million stock buyback program. In connection with the approval of the new share repurchase plan, the share repurchase plan previously approved in September 2011 was terminated. The program allows us to purchase our common stock or enter into equity derivative transactions related to our common stock. The timing and actual amount expended with the new authorized funds will depend on a variety of factors including the market price of our common stock, regulatory, legal, and contractual requirements, alternatives uses of cash, availability of on shore cash and other market factors. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and may be modified or suspended at any time at our discretion. From September 2011 through the termination of the program, we used $327.4 million from the program to repurchase 24.4 million shares at an average share price of $13.4. Under the new program authorized in October, 2015 through the end of fiscal 2015, we used $56.5 million to repurchase 5.7 million share at an average price of $10.0.\nAs of February 26, 2016, we repurchased a total of 29.3 million shares for a total cost of $237.8 million under the new program. As of February 26, 2016, the total dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the program is approximately $212.2 million.\nYield Enhancement Program ( YEP\u201d):\nAs discussed under Item 5 above and in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, we have periodically entered into short term yield enhanced structured agreements since fiscal 2009.\nIn fiscal 2014, we entered into short-term yield enhanced structured agreements with maturities ranging from 30 to 45 days at an aggregate price of $19.4 million. Upon settlement of these agreements, we received $19.7 million in cash. In fiscal 2013 we didn't enter into any short-term yield enhanced structured agreements.\nIn fiscal 2015, we entered into a short-term yield enhanced structured agreements with maturities ranging from 10 to 30 days at an aggregate price of $38.6 million. Upon settlement of these agreements, we received $29.4 million in cash and one million shares at an average price of $9.60.\nSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\nOn October 17, 2013, we amended our credit facility to reduce the revolving commitments to $300 million. In connection with the reduction, certain financial covenants were amended. The amended financial covenants include the following conditions: 1) maximum senior secured leverage ratio of 2.50 to 1.00 through January 1, 2017 and 2.25 to 1.00 thereafter, 2) maximum total leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.00 through January 3, 2015, 3.5 to 1.00 through January 1, 2017 and 3.00 to 1.00 thereafter, 3) minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00, and 4) minimum liquidity of at least $100 million. Borrowings are collateralized by substantially all assets of the company.\nOn March 12, 2015, we amended and restated our existing senior secured revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility\u201d) and increased the size of the Credit Facility from $300 million to $450 million. The restated agreement also contains an option permitting us to arrange additional commitments of $250 million ( Incremental Availability\u201d) and specifies that the proceeds of these loans may be used for working capital, acquisitions, stock repurchases and general corporate purposes. The borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest, at the Company's option, at an adjusted base rate plus a spread of 1.25%, or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 2.25%. The borrowings under the Credit Facility are collateralized by substantially all of the Company's assets. The financial covenants were amended to include the following conditions: 1) maximum total leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 through January 1, 2017, and 3.00 to 1.00 thereafter, 2) minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00. At January 3, 2016, the Company's outstanding borrowings of $449.0 million were recorded as part of long-term liabilities and are presented as Long-term revolving credit facility and long term debt\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We incurred financing costs of $2.3 million to the new lenders of the Credit Facility which has been capitalized and recognized in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These costs will be amortized over the life of the Credit Facility.\nAs per the terms of the Credit Facility, we entered into a Joinder Agreement on December 22, 2015 under which we borrowed an additional $97.2 million ( Term Loan A\u201d), net of costs. Term Loan A is subject to, at the Company's option, either an interest rate equal to (i) 3.25% over LIBOR or (ii) an interest rate equal to 2.25% over the greater of (x) the prime lending rate published by the Wall Street Journal, (y) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (z) the LIBOR rate for a one month interest period plus 1%. The Company paid a 1.00% upfront fee in connection with the Term Loan A.\nThe Credit Facility, as amended, provides for a $450 million revolving credit facility and generally contains the same representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default that it contained prior to the effectiveness of the Amendment. The Amendment did not change the interest rate or maturity applicable to the Credit Facility and the Credit Facility remains guaranteed by certain present and future wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries (the Guarantors\u201d) and secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets and the Guarantors.\nOn January 6, 2016, we entered into an Incremental Revolving Joinder Agreement to our Credit Facility to increase the amount of revolving commitments under our Credit Facility by an additional $90 million. The total aggregate amount of revolving commitments under the Credit Facility starting January 6, 2016 is $540 million.\nThe proceeds of the loans made under the Credit Facility may be used for working capital, acquisitions, stock repurchases and general corporate purposes. As of the filing date of this Form 10-K, $449.5 million aggregate principal amount of loans and letters of credit are outstanding under the Credit Facility and none of the Incremental Availability has been used.\nAs of January 3, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the Credit Facility.\nRefer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for more information on our senior secured revolving credit facility.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 3, 2016:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 and 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 and 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 167,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 160,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease commitments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2.00% Senior Exchangeable Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Term Loan A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments on debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 449,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 449,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License fee commitments (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,037,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 216,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 716,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Purchase obligations primarily include non-cancelable purchase orders for materials, services, manufacturing equipment, building improvements and supplies in the ordinary course of business.

In June 2015, the Company paid an additional license fee of $18.5 million under the existing license agreement due to the merger with Spansion in March 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of January 3, 2016 our unrecognized tax benefits were $28.4 million, which were classified as long-term liabilities. We believe it is possible that we may recognize approximately $7 million of our existing unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months as a result of the lapse of statutes of limitations and the resolution of agreements with domestic and various foreign tax authorities.\nSale of Spansion's Sunnyvale property\nOn January 23, 2014, Spansion sold its property in Sunnyvale, California, consisting of 24.5 acres of land with approximately 471,000 square feet of buildings that included its headquarters building and submicron development center, a Pacific Gas & Electric transmission facility and a warehouse building, for net consideration of $59.0 million. Spansion concurrently leased back approximately 170,000 square feet of the headquarters building on a month-to-month basis with the option to continue the lease for up to 24 months; thereafter either party could terminate the lease. The first six months of the lease were rent free; thereafter the rents were lower than the market rates. For accounting purposes, these rents were deemed to have been netted against the sale proceeds and represent prepaid rent. As such, the use of the property after its sale constituted continuing involvement, and recognition of the sale of the property was deferred until the lease period ended. In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we terminated the lease on the Sunnyvale building and recognized an immaterial gain.\nEquity Investment Commitments\nAs disclosed in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have committed to purchase additional preferred stock from a company that operates in the area of advanced battery storage. During the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016, we purchased $28.0 million of preferred stock which was recorded as part of our investments in non-marketable securities. Subject to the attainment of certain milestones, we may purchase additional preferred stock of this company.\nCapital Resources and Financial Condition\nOur long-term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest-bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and debt securities, the purchase of our stock through our stock buyback program and payments of regularly scheduled cash dividends. In addition we may use excess cash to invest in our ETD, enter into strategic investments and partnerships and pursue acquisitions. As of January 3, 2016 in addition to $226.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, we had $0.9 million invested in short-term investments for a total cash and short-term investment position of $227.6 million that is available for use in current operations.\nAs of January 3, 2016, approximately 63.0% of our cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments are held outside of the United States. While these amounts are primarily invested in U.S. dollars, a portion is held in foreign currencies. All offshore balances are exposed to local political, banking, currency control and other risks. In addition, these amounts, if repatriated may be subject to tax and other transfer restrictions.\nWe believe that liquidity provided by existing cash, cash equivalents and investments and our borrowing arrangements will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, should prevailing economic conditions, debt covenants constraints, and/or financial, business and other factors beyond our control adversely affect our estimates of our future cash requirements, we could be required to fund our cash requirements by alternative financing. There can be no assurance that additional financing, if needed, would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. We may also choose at any time to raise additional capital or debt to strengthen our financial position, facilitate growth, enter into strategic initiatives including the acquisition of other companies, repurchases of shares of stock or increase our dividends or pay a special dividend and provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of other business opportunities that arise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Cypress uses non-GAAP measures to assess the following financial measures which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures:\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Gross margin\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Research and development expenses\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Diluted net income (loss) per share\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges primarily related to Spansion merger costs and related amortization, which represented approximately 83% of total adjustments for the year ended January 3, 2016 as well as stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Cypress's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Cypress's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Cypress's business and operations. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision-making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to Cypress's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G and to make clear to our investors the adjustments we make to GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands, except per shares amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,626,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 725,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 722,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 573,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 381,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 377,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 252,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 147,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 161,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 137,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 90,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 96,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP pretax profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 91,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP net income attributable to Cypress\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP diluted net income per share attributable to\nCypress\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that providing these Non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, are useful to investors because they allow investors to see our results through the eyes\u201d of management as these Non-GAAP financial measures reflect our internal measurement processes.

based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the data used to prepare them. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and we are required to make estimates, judgments and assumptions in the course of such preparation. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, inventory valuation, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and financial instruments, stock-based compensation, and settlement costs, and income taxes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies that are affected by significant estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition:\nWe generate revenues by selling products to distributors, various types of manufacturers including original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d) and electronic manufacturing service providers ( EMSs\u201d). We recognize revenue on sales to OEMs and EMSs provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, title has transferred, collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, there are no customer acceptance requirements, and there are no remaining significant obligations.\nSales to certain distributors are made under agreements which provide the distributors with price protection, stock rotation and other allowances under certain circumstances. When we determine that the uncertainties associated with the rights given to these distributors, revenues and costs related to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the end customers. In those circumstances, revenues are recognized upon receiving notification from the distributors that products have been sold to the end customers. In these cases, at the time of shipment to distributors, we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to receive payment, relieves inventory for the value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributors, and defers the related margin and price adjustment as deferred income on sales to distributors on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any effects of distributor price adjustments are recorded as a reduction to deferred income at the time the distributors sell the products to the end customers and the distributor submits a valid claim for the price adjustment.\nWe have historically recognized a significant portion of revenue through distributors at the time the distributor resold the product to its end customer (also referred to as the sell-through basis of revenue recognition) given the difficulty in estimating the ultimate price of these product shipments and amount of potential returns. We continuously reassesses our ability to reliably estimate the ultimate price of these products and, over the past several years, have made investments in our systems and process around our distribution channel to improve the quality of the information it receives from our distributors. Given these ongoing investments, and based on the financial framework for estimating potential price adjustments, beginning the fourth quarter of 2014, we concluded that we were able to reasonable estimate returns and pricing concessions on certain product families and with certain distributors, and we recognized revenue at the time it shipped these specific products to the identified distributors, less its estimate of future price adjustments and returns. As a result of this change, we recognized an incremental $12.3 million of revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. The impact of this change resulted in an increase of $6.2 million to net income attributable to Cypress for fiscal 2014, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share. During fiscal 2015, we recognized $40.9 million of incremental revenue from this change, which resulted in a decrease in net loss of $25.0 million or $0.07 per basic and diluted shares. During fiscal 2015, we recognized $780.8 million or 68% of distribution revenue on a sell-in basis.\nWe record as a reduction to revenues reserves for sales returns, price protection and allowances, based upon historical experience rates and for any specific known customer amounts. We also provide certain distributors and EMSs with volume-pricing discounts, such as rebates and incentives, which are recorded as a reduction to revenues at the time of sale. Historically these volume discounts have not been significant.\nOur revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent, accurate and timely data from our distributors. Distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product, price, quantity, and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock. Because the data set is large and complex and because there may be errors in the reported data, we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors' reported inventories to their activities. Actual results could vary materially from those estimates.\nBusiness Combinations:\nWe apply the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d), in the accounting for acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Accounting for business combinations requires the Company's management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates it has made have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts Receivable:\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers' inability to make required payments. We make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by considering factors such as historical bad debt experience, specific customer creditworthiness, the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic trends that may affect a customer's ability to pay. If the data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our results of operations could be materially affected.\nValuation of Inventories:\nManagement periodically reviews the adequacy of our inventory reserves. We record a write-down for our inventories which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. We perform a detailed review of inventories each quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans and current sales levels. Inventory reserves are not relieved until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped. Our inventories may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and are sold in a highly competitive industry. If there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to record additional write-downs, and our gross margin could be adversely affected. In fiscal 2015, we recorded approximately $133 million of inventory reserves to write down inventory assumed as part of the merger.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets:\nOur business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities and equipment that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly under-utilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand. In addition, we have recorded intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions.\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our business, significant negative industry or economic trends, and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time. Impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value, and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analysis. If there is a significant adverse change in our business in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges on our long-lived assets.\nValuation of Goodwill:\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We assess our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. In accordance with ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, qualitative factors can be assessed to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test for goodwill impairment. If we believe, as a result of our qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required.\nWe have four reporting units of which two, Memory Products division (MPD) and Programmable Systems Division (PSD), have goodwill. Determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are also unpredictable and inherently uncertain.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended January 3, 2016 were as follows:\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> MPD\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> PSD\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill as of December 28, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill from merger with Spansion (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 739,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 937,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,676,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Measurement period adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,850\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,850\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill as of January 3, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 770,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 968,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,738,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Refer Note 2 for further details.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn the first day of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment using the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.\nWe estimated the fair values of our reporting units using a combination of the income and market approach. These valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, forecasted financial information, growth rates, terminal or residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\nThe income approach utilizes estimates of discounted future cash flows. Key assumptions used in the market approach include the selection of appropriate benchmark companies and the selection of an appropriate market value multiple for each reporting unit based on a comparison of the reporting unit with the benchmark companies as of the impairment testing date.\nIn performing our 2015 assessment, we applied a weighting of 75% to the income approach and 25% to the market approach. Given that the reporting units are transitioning out of a period of declining revenue and profit, we believe the income approach is a better indication of the going concern value of the reporting units as it better captures the expected improvement in revenue and profit. As such, we placed more weighing on the income approach. Furthermore, as the market approach reflected general macroeconomic concerns that were evidenced in valuations for multiple publicly traded companies, the Company concluded this approach was not as relevant to the impairment calculation.\nBased on our goodwill impairment testing, we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill. The fair value of our MPD reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 53% and the fair value of our PSD reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 9%. As a result, if we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit, it would have resulted in the fair value of our PSD reporting unit being less than its carrying value. As an overall test of the reasonableness of estimated fair values of our two reporting units, we reconciled the combined fair value estimates of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of the valuation date. The reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were relatively representative of the market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization. However, any significant reductions in the actual amount of future cash flows realized by our reporting units, reductions in the value of market comparables, or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair values of our reporting units. Such events could ultimately result in a material charge to our results of operations in future periods due to the potential for a write-down of the goodwill associated with our reporting units.\nBased on our testing, we determined that there was a risk of our PSD reporting unit failing the first step of goodwill impairment test in future periods. For this reporting unit, the underlying assumptions we used in assessing fair value include, but are not limited to, declines in our stock price or our peers' stock prices, relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or small changes in other key assumptions, such as revenue growth rates and discount rates. Specifically, the income approach valuation for PSD included the following assumptions for 2015:\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk free rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Peer company beta\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur PSD reporting unit is highly sensitive to management's plans for increasing sales and gross margins by expanding PSOC 3/4/5 and the Automotive business as well as the achievement of our cost reduction initiatives. If the actual revenue growth and profitability improvements forecasted for the PSD reporting unit do not achieve the levels we estimated in assessing the fair value of the PSD reporting unit, the fair value of the PSD reporting unit may decline. A future decline in the fair value of the PSD reporting unit may result in the recognition of an impairment charge to our earnings as a result of a write-down of the value of the goodwill associated with that reporting unit.\nOur next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed on the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. Such indicators include, but are not limited to, challenging economic conditions, such as a decline in our operating results, an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions. Such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a decrease in fair value and require us to record goodwill impairment charges.\nIn fiscal 2014, we elected to perform a qualitative analysis for impairment on goodwill rather than to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. We assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. After assessing many qualitative factors pertinent to our Company we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: 1) change in the industry and competitive environment, 2) market capitalization, 3) stock price and 4) overall financial performance. Based on the results of the testing, no goodwill impairment was recognized in fiscal 2014.\nIn fiscal 2013, we elected to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Based on the results of the testing, no goodwill impairment was recognized in 2013.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments:\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Our financial assets and financial liabilities that require recognition under the guidance generally include available-for-sale investments, employee deferred compensation plan and foreign currency derivatives. The guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. As such, fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity-specific measure. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Level 1 includes instruments for which quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Our financial assets utilizing Level 1 inputs include U.S. treasuries, money market funds, marketable equity securities and our employee deferred compensation plan assets with the exception of our stable value funds which are considered Level 2 instruments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Level 2 includes instruments for which the valuations are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets consist of certain marketable debt instruments for which values are determined using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Our Level 2 instruments include certain U.S. government securities, commercial paper, corporate notes and bonds, assets held-for-sale and our employee deferred compensation plan liabilities and our stable value funds included in our deferred compensation plan assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Level 3 includes valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. Financial assets utilizing Level 3 inputs primarily include auction rate securities. We do not have any financial assets or liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow Hedges:\nThe Company enters into cash flow hedges to protect non-functional currency revenues, inventory purchases and certain other operational expenses against variability in cash flows due to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company's foreign currency forward contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges have maturities between three and nine months. All hedging relationships are formally documented, and the hedges are designed to offset changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions at the inception of the hedge. The Company recognizes derivative instruments from hedging activities as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures them at fair value on a monthly basis. The Company records changes in the intrinsic value of its cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. Interest charges or forward points\u201d on the forward contracts are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recorded in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. When the forecasted transaction occurs, the Company reclassifies the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue or costs, depending on the risk hedged. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the Company will reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income (expense), net in its Consolidated Statements of Operations at that time.\nThe Company evaluates hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively and records any ineffective portion of the hedge in other income (expense), net in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer Note 11 for further details on cash flow and balance sheet hedges.\nStock-Based Compensation:\nUnder the fair value recognition provisions of the guidance, we recognize stock-based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the awards. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including measurement of level of achievement of performance milestones, the expected life of the share-based payment awards and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our future stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded.\nEmployee Benefit Plans:\nIn connection with the Merger, we assumed the Spansion Innovates Group Cash Balance Plan (a defined benefit pension plan) in Japan. A defined benefit pension plan is accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions such as turnover rates, discount rates and other factors. The discount rate assumption is determined by comparing the projected benefit payments to the Japanese corporate bonds yield curve as of end of the most recently completed fiscal year. The benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation (PBO), which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement. This liability is recorded in other long term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net periodic pension cost is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and includes service cost. Service cost represents the actuarial present value of participant benefits earned in the current year. Interest cost represents the time value of money associated with the passage of time on the PBO. Gains or losses resulting from a change in the PBO if actual results differ from actuarial assumptions will be accumulated and amortized over the future life of the plan participants if they exceed 10% of the PBO, being the corridor amount. If the amount of a net gain or loss does not exceed the corridor amount, it will be recorded to other comprehensive income (loss). See Note 17 for further details of the pension plans.\nAccounting for Income Taxes:\nOur global operations involve manufacturing, research and development and selling activities. Profits from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country taxes but are not subject to U.S. tax until repatriated to the U.S. United States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. Should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. This adjustment would increase income in the period such determination is made.\nThe calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to expense would result.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended that involve risks and uncertainties, which are discussed under Item 1A.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nGeneral\nCypress Semiconductor Corporation ( Cypress\u201d) delivers high-performance, high-quality solutions at the heart of today's most advanced embedded systems, from automotive, industrial and networking platforms to highly interactive consumer and mobile devices.

The comparability of our operating results for the year ended January 3, 2016 to the same period in fiscal 2014 is significantly impacted by our Merger. In our discussion and analysis of comparative periods, we have quantified the contribution of additional revenue or expense resulting from this transaction wherever such amounts were material and identifiable. While identified amounts may provide indications of general trends, the analysis cannot completely address the effects attributable to integration efforts.\nDivestiture of TrueTouch\u00ae Business\nOn August 1, 2015, we completed the sale of the TrueTouch\u00ae mobile touchscreen business, which is a business unit within our Programmable Systems Division, to Parade Technologies ( Parade\u201d) for total cash proceeds of $98.6 million pursuant to the definitive agreement signed on June 11, 2015. Of the total cash proceeds, $10.0 million are held in an escrow account until January 2017 subject to any indemnity claims on post-closing adjustments, per the terms of the agreement. Post-sale, Cypress will continue to provide TrueTouch\u00ae solutions to its automotive, industrial and home appliance customers and to its mobile customers. In connection with the transaction, we sold certain assets associated with the disposed business mostly consisting of inventory with a net book value of $10.5 million and recognized a gain of $66.5 million in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2015. This gain has been presented as a separate line item Gain on divestiture of TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAlso in connection with the transaction, we entered into a Manufacturing Service Agreement (MSA) in which we agreed to sell finished wafers and devices to Parade during the one-year period following the close of the transaction. The terms of the MSA indicated that we would sell finished products to Parade at agreed-upon prices that were considered below fair market value, indicating that there was an embedded fair value that would be realized by Parade through those terms. Accordingly, we have allocated $19.9 million from the $98.6 million proceeds to the fair value of the MSA based on the forecasted wafer sales to Parade for the subsequent one-year period. Such amount was deferred on our consolidated balance sheet initially and is being amortized to revenue as we sell products to Parade. During the year ended January 3, 2016, we recognized $5.7 million of revenue from amortization of such deferred revenue.\nAs of the end of fiscal 2015, our organization included the following business segments:\n Business Segments Description PSD: Programmable Systems Division PSD focuses on high-performance, programmable solutions. The programmable portfolio includes high-performance Traveo\u2122 automotive microcontrollers, PSoC\u00ae programmable system-on-chip products, ARM\u00ae Cortex\u00ae-M4, -M3, -M0+ microcontrollers and R4 CPUs, analog PMIC Power Management ICs, CapSense\u00ae capacitive-sensing controllers, TrueTouch\u00ae touchscreen and fingerprint reader products, and PSoC Bluetooth Low Energy solutions for the IoT. PSD added Spansion's microcontroller and analog products starting March 12, 2015. MPD: Memory Products Division MPD focuses on high-performance parallel and serial NOR flash memories, NAND flash memories, static random access memory (SRAM), and high-reliability F-RAM\u2122 ferroelectric memory devices. Its purpose is to enhance our position in these products and invent new products and derivatives. MPD added Spansion's Flash memory products starting March 12, 2015. DCD: Data Communications Division DCD focuses on USB controllers, Bluetooth\u00ae Low Energy solutions that leverage Cypress's PRoC\u2122 programmable radio-on-chip technology, WirelessUSB\u2122 solutions, module solutions such as trackpads and Bluetooth Low Energy modules, and controllers for the new USB Type-C standard, which enables data transmission and power delivery over a single cable with a slimmer plug. DCD focuses primarily on industrial, handset and consumer electronics markets and applications. ETD: Emerging Technologies Division Also known as our startup\u201d division, ETD includes subsidiaries AgigA Tech Inc. and Deca Technologies Inc., as well as our foundry business and other development-stage activities. \nOur primary focus is profitable growth in our key markets. With the addition of the legacy Spansion business, we plan to capitalize on our expanded product portfolio and leadership positions in embedded processing and specialized memories to significantly extend our penetration of global markets such as automotive, industrial, communications, consumer, computation, data communications, mobile handsets and military. Our revenue model is based on the following product and market strategies: (a) increasing market share in our memory products by leveraging our market position and expanding our portfolio with new and complementary products, (b) growing revenue from our high-performance, programmable solutions and derivatives including PSoC programmable system-on-chip products and microcontrollers in the automotive and industrial markets, (c) increasing our DCD revenue through the introduction of new products such as USB Type-C solutions, SuperSpeed USB 3.0 peripheral controllers and Bluetooth\u00ae Low Energy solutions that leverage Cypress's PRoC\u2122 programmable radio-on-chip technology for the IoT and other applications, and (d) revenue growth from ETD, which includes our internal startup companies. For profitability, our focus is to integrate the acquired Spansion business successfully and realize the anticipated product cost and operational cost synergies. Our integration effort includes the re-focusing of portions of legacy Spansion business to higher-margin opportunities, particularly in the Flash memory business. We monitor our operating expenses closely to improve our operating leverage as driven by various company-wide initiatives, including our World Class Cost program to continuously reduce cost line items as well as a Human Resources effort to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency across the company.\nIn order to achieve our goals on revenue growth and profitability, Cypress will continue to pursue the following strategies:\n \u00b7 Successfully integrate our business with Spansion. We are committed to integrating the business of Cypress and Spansion successfully to realize the anticipated cost synergies and improve the bottom line. \n \u00b7 Cross-sell products from Cypress's expanded product portfolio in the wake of the Spansion Merger. We will continue to take advantage of product and business synergies and grow our top-line revenue. \n \u00b7 Focus on large and growing markets. We will continue to pursue business opportunities in large and growing markets, particularly the automotive and industrial markets. \n \u00b7 Drive profitability. Cypress has implemented and maintained a tight, corporate wide focus on gross margin and operating expenses. We are committed to maintaining our current strong operating expense management without compromising our new product development and investments in our Emerging Technologies Division. \n \u00b7 Drive programmable technologies, extend our leadership in programmable products and drive PSoC and microcontroller proliferation. We will continue to define, design and develop new programmable products and solutions that offer our customers increased flexibility and efficiency, higher performance, and higher levels of integration with a focus on analog functionality. We will continue to drive PSoC and microcontroller adoption in our key market segments. \n \u00b7 Collaborate with customers to build system-level solutions. We work closely with our customers from initial product design through manufacturing and delivery to optimize their design efforts, help them achieve product differentiation, improve their time-to-market and help them to develop whole product solutions. \n \u00b7 Leverage flexible manufacturing. Our manufacturing strategy combines capacity from leading foundries with output from our internal manufacturing facilities. This enables us to meet rapid swings in customer demand while reducing the burden of high fixed costs. \n \u00b7 Identify and exit legacy or non-strategic, underperforming businesses. We will continue to monitor and, if necessary, to exit certain business units that are inconsistent with our future initiatives and long-term financial plans so that we can focus our resources and efforts on our core programmable and proprietary business model. The sale of our TrueTouch\u00ae mobile touchscreen business to Parade Technologies, Ltd. during the third quarter of 2015 is an example of this business strategy. \n \u00b7 Pursue complementary strategic relationships. We will continue to assess opportunities to develop strategic relationships through acquisitions, investments, licensing and joint development projects. We also will continue to make significant investments in current ventures as well as new ventures. \nAs we continue to implement our strategies, there are many internal and external factors that could impact our ability to meet any or all of our objectives. Some of these factors are discussed under Item 1A.\nManufacturing Strategy\nOur core manufacturing strategy-\u201dflexible manufacturing\u201d-combines capacity from foundries with output from our internal manufacturing facilities. This strategy is intended to allow us to meet rapid swings in customer demand while lessening the burden of high fixed costs, a capability that is particularly important in high-volume consumer markets that we serve with our leading programmable product portfolio.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenues\nOur total revenues increased by $882.4 million or 121.6% to $1,607.9 million for the year ended January 3, 2016 compared to the prior year. For the year ended January 3, 2016, $962.3 million of the increase was attributable to revenue contributions from the acquired Spansion business which is included in the PSD and MPD divisions. The overall increase was partially offset by decrease in revenue from TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business as a result of divestiture of the business on August 1, 2015. The overall average selling price of our products, including Spansion products, for the year ended January 3, 2016 was $1.09. Excluding Spansion products, our ASP for the year ended January 3, 2016 was $1.14, which increased by $0.05 compared with the same period in the prior year.\nThe Company operates on a 52 or 53 week year ending on the Sunday nearest to December 31. Fiscal 2014 and 2013 were each 52 weeks and fiscal 2015 was a 53-week year, with the extra week in the fourth fiscal quarter. The additional week in 2015 did not materially affect the Company's results of operations or financial position.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, moderate pricing pressure in certain product lines, primarily due to competitive conditions. We have in the past been able to, and expect in the future to be able to, moderate average selling price declines in our product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices. We may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nConsistent with our accounting policies and generally accepted accounting principles, we have historically recognized a significant portion of revenue through distributors at the time the distributor resold the product to its end customer (also referred to as the sell-through basis of revenue recognition) given the difficulty in estimating the ultimate price of these product shipments and amount of potential returns. We continually reassess our ability to reliably estimate the ultimate price of these products and, over the past several years, we have made investments in our systems and processes around our distribution channel to improve the quality of the information we receive from our distributors. Given these ongoing investments, and based on the financial framework we use for estimating potential price adjustments, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, we concluded that we have become able to reasonably estimate returns and pricing concessions on certain product families and with certain distributors, and recognized revenue at the time we shipped these specific products to the identified distributors, less our estimate of future price adjustments and returns. During the year ended January 3, 2016, we recognized an incremental $40.9 million of revenue on additional product families for which revenue was previously recognized on a sell-through basis as we determined that we could reasonably estimate returns and pricing concessions at the time of shipment to distributors. This change resulted in a decrease to the net loss of $25.0 million for the year ended January 3, 2016 or $0.07 per basic and diluted share.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated revenues by segments:\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Programmable Systems Division\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 613,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 283,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 292,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Memory Products Division\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 871,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 347,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 338,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data Communications Division\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Emerging Technologies and Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,607,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 725,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 722,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProgrammable Systems Division:\nRevenues from the Programmable Systems Division in fiscal 2015 increased by $330.7 million or 116.8% compared to fiscal 2014. The increase in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the $402.3 million of revenue contribution from the Spansion microcontroller and analog business for fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact of Spansion revenues, PSD decreased by $71.6 million for fiscal 2015, or 25.3%, compared to the prior year primarily due to weakness in our end customers' handset/mobile business demand, decrease in revenue from TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business as a result of divestiture of the business on August 1, 2015 and incremental revenue in fiscal 2014 as a result of the change in accounting for certain distributor revenues. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of PSD products to the automotive applications, where we experienced a ramp in volume from recent design wins.\nRevenues from the Programmable Systems Division in fiscal 2014 decreased by $9.5 million or 3.2% compared to fiscal 2013. The revenue decrease in fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to declines in sales of our TrueTouch\u00ae touchscreen products due to a decrease in revenue from our handset customers and lower average selling prices. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of PSD products to industrial and automotive customers where we experienced a ramp in volume from new design wins. Fiscal 2014 revenue also included $8.2 million of incremental revenue as a result of the change in accounting for certain distributor revenues as discussed above.\nMemory Products Division:\nRevenues from the Memory Products Division increased in fiscal 2015 by $523.8 million or 150.6% compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to $560.0 million of revenue contribution from the Spansion flash memory business for fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact of Spansion revenues, MPD decreased by $36.2 million or 10.4% in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year primarily driven by sales decrease in the communication market segment.\nRevenues from the Memory Products Division in fiscal 2014 increased by $8.9 million or 2.6% as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to an increase in sales of nonvolatile products associated with our acquisition of Ramtron in fiscal 2012, offset by a decrease in SRAM products driven by a continuing decrease in demand from wireless and wireline end customers. Fiscal 2014 revenue also included $4.1 million of incremental revenue as a result of the change in accounting for certain distributor revenues as discussed above.\nData Communications Division:\nRevenue for the Data Communication Division in fiscal 2015 increased by $2.4 million or 3.4% compared to fiscal 2014 due to increasing revenue in our super speed USB products, offset by a decline in our trackpad products..\nRevenue for the Data Communication Division in fiscal 2014 decreased by $9.0 million or 11.4% compared to fiscal 2013 due to declining revenue in our legacy high-speed USB controllers, optical navigation and trackpad products.\nEmerging Technologies and Other:\nRevenues from the Emerging Technologies Division increased by $25.5 million or 106.2% in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to the overall increase in demand at all of our Emerging Technologies companies. The increase was also attributable to increase in our Foundry revenues as we began selling products to Parade Technologies in August 2015 under the Manufacturing Services Agreement, which was signed in connection with our disposition of TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business.\nRevenue from the Emerging Technologies Division in fiscal 2014 increased by $12.4 million or 107.3% compared to fiscal 2013 due to increased revenue in all three business - Deca Tech, Agiga Tech and our foundry business. The increase is due to the overall increase in demand as certain of our Emerging Technologies companies begin to ramp production with new customer design wins.\nCost of Revenues/Gross Margin\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,207,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 361,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 384,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 46.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross margin consists of Revenues less Cost of revenues, and gross margin percentage is percentage of gross margin to revenue. Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on factors such as the mix of types of products sold and the impact of changes to inventory provisions, such as the write-down of inventory. Our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell, which is often difficult to estimate with accuracy. Therefore, if we achieve significant revenue growth in our lower margin product lines, or if we are unable to earn as much revenue as we expect from higher margin product lines, our gross margin may be negatively impacted.\nGross margin percentage declined to 24.9% in fiscal 2015 from 50.1% in fiscal 2014. The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to impact of the merger with Spansion, which historically had lower gross margins than Cypress, and $133.0 million of additional inventory reserves which were recorded on inventory assumed as a part of the Merger. The additional reserves on inventory were recognized as part of our strategy to focus on high margin, profitable business as a combined company. Total charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions, including reserves on inventory assumed as part of the Merger, totaled $152.5 million for fiscal 2015 and $19.8 million for fiscal 2014, unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 9.5% and 3.0%, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $6.4 million for fiscal 2015 and $3.7 million for fiscal 2014, favorably impacting our gross margin by 0.4% and 1.0%, respectively. Our gross margin for fiscal 2015 was also impacted by $84.4 million of amortization of fair value adjustments, net of reserves, relating to acquired legacy Spansion inventory.\nGross margin percentage increased to 50.1% in fiscal 2014 from 46.8% in fiscal 2013 primarily driven by lower cost of revenue expenses associated with the inventory acquired in the Ramtron acquisition, higher factory absorption and product and customer mix. Charges to cost of revenue for inventory reserve provisions were $19.8 million during fiscal 2014 and $12.8 million for fiscal 2013, unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 3% and 2%, respectively. The benefit realized from sales of inventory previously reserved were $3.7 million and $5.1 million for fiscal year 2014 and fiscal 2013, favorably impacting our gross margin by 1% and 1%, respectively.\nResearch and Development ( R&D\u201d)\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> R&D expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 281,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 164,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 190,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nR&D expenditures increased by $116.8 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was mainly attributable to $108.3 million of additional expenses due to the Merger, primarily comprised of $63.0 million of labor costs due to additional headcount, $24.0 million of building, repairs and other overhead expenses, $7.7 million of material costs on R&D projects, $8.5 million of professional services related to Information technology and other outside services and $9.5 million of increase in stock-based compensation expense.\nR&D expenditures decreased by $26.3 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $9.9 million in stock-based compensation and a decrease of $1.0 million in deferred compensation expense. There was an additional decrease in consulting fees and other outside services of $2.9 million and $10.0 million, respectively, as a result of a worldwide cost cutting effort. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses were lower in fiscal 2014 driven by the decrease in total expense in the same period.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d)\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SG&A expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 323,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 170,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 182,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSG&A expenses increased by $152.8 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was mainly due to $99.6 million of expenses from the Merger, primarily comprised of $50.0 million of labor costs due to additional headcount, $39.0 million of building, supplies, repairs and other overhead expenses, and $15.0 million of professional services expense related to information technology, legal and finance. Additionally, we also incurred $17.4 million of costs for professional fees for legal and audit services related to the Merger integration activities, $5.0M of termination costs on legacy Spansion patent license agreement and $30.6 million of increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to the 2015 PARS grants.\nSG&A expenses decreased by $11.9 million in fiscal 2014 or 6.5% compared to fiscal 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in stock-based compensation of $13.4 million, a $7.9 million decrease in headcount related expenditures, a $2.0 million decrease in deferred compensation expense, a $1.6 million decrease in variable bonus-related expense, offset by $7.3 million of acquisition related expenditures associated with our proposed merger with Spansion, an increase of $2.7 million in legal fees and $1.3 million in accrued estimated legal settlements.\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets\nDuring fiscal 2015, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets increased by $101.7 million compared to fiscal 2014. The increase is primarily due to the amortization on the intangibles acquired in connection with the Merger.\nDuring fiscal 2014, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets decreased by $1.1 million compared to fiscal 2013. The decrease is primarily related to certain intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2012 that were fully amortized during fiscal 2013.\nRestructuring\nIn March 2015, we began the implementation of planned cost reduction and restructuring activities in connection with the Merger. As part of this Spansion integration-related restructuring plan, we expect to eliminate approximately 1,000 positions from the combined workforce across all business and functional areas on a global basis. The restructuring charge of $90.1 million recorded for the year ended January 3, 2016 primarily consists of severance costs, lease termination costs and impairment of property, plant and equipment. The lease termination costs include approximately $18 million relating to the buildings Spansion had leased prior to the Merger, which we decided not to occupy in the post-Merger period. The initial term of the lease commenced on January 1, 2015 and will expire on December 31, 2026.\nThe following table summarizes the restructuring charges recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented pursuant to the Spansion Integration-Related Restructuring Plan:\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personnel costs\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 58,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease termination costs and other related charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total restructuring and other charges (benefit)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 90,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe anticipate that the remaining restructuring accrual balance will be paid out in cash through 2016 for employee terminations and over the remaining lease term through 2026 for the excess lease obligation.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we have realized approximately $137.7 million of synergy savings on an annualized basis from the restructuring actions taken. Upon completion of all of our actions, we anticipate our annualized synergy savings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to be approximately $160 million. When complete, we estimate approximately 40% of the savings will impact cost of goods sold and the remaining 60% will impact operating expenses. There can be no assurance that we will achieve these anticipated savings.\nGain on Divestiture of TruTouch\u00ae Mobile Business\nIn connection with the sale of the TrueTouch\u00ae mobile touchscreen business to Parade for total cash proceeds of $98.6 million, we sold certain assets associated with the disposed business mostly consisting of inventory with a net book value of $10.5 million and recognized a gain of $66.5 million in fiscal 2015, net of the amount of gain deferred in connection with an ongoing manufacturing service agreement we entered into with Parade in connection with the divestiture.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for fiscal 2015 was $16.4 million and represents accretion of interest expense on 2.00% Senior Exchangeable Notes, interest expense incurred on our revolving line of credit, Term Loan A and other debt.\nInterest expense for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 was $5.8 million and $8.1 million, respectively, and represents interest expense incurred on our revolving line of credit and other term debt.\nRefer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for more information about our credit facilities.\nOther Income (expense), Net\nThe following table summarizes the components of other income (expense), net:\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in fair value of investments under the deferred\ncompensation plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,354\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized loss on marketable securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,655\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,495\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of equity investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Others\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (59\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,769\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEmployee Deferred Compensation Plan\nWe have a deferred compensation plan, which provides certain key employees, including our executive management, with the ability to defer the receipt of compensation in order to accumulate funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. We do not make contributions to the deferred compensation plan and we do not guarantee returns on the investments. Participant deferrals and investment gains and losses remain as our liabilities and the underlying assets are subject to claims of general creditors. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized changes in fair value of the assets under the deferred compensation plan in Other income (expense), net\u201d of $1.4 million of interest expense, $3.0 million and $6.4 million of interest income, respectively. The increase or decrease in the fair value of the investments relates to the increased or decreased performance of the portfolio on a year over year basis. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for more information about our deferred compensation plan.\nGain on Sale of Investments in Marketable Equity Securities\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we sold our investment in a certain marketable equity security for $2.2 million, which resulted in a realized gain of $1.1 million.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Ramtron, we recognized a gain of $1.7 million on our initial investment in Ramtron of $3.4 million. For more information about our acquisition, refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8.\nUnrealized loss on marketable securities\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased 6.9 million ordinary shares of Hua Hong Semiconductor Limited (HHSL) for an aggregate price of $10.0 million in connection with their initial public offering. HHSL is the parent company of Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, which is one of our strategic foundry partners. We recorded an unrealized loss on our investment in HHSL's ordinary shares of $4.7 million and $1.5 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, as a result of the decline in the fair market value of the investment.\nEquity in Net Loss of Equity Method Investee\nDuring fiscal 2015, we invested an additional $28.0 million in a battery company. The additional investment in this company increased our ownership interest in the company's outstanding stock from 26.2% as of December 28, 2014 to 38.7% as of January 3, 2016. We have accounted for our investment in this entity under the equity method of accounting since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, when we changed from the cost method of accounting to the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, we are required to record our interest in the investee's reported net income or loss for each reporting period. Additionally, we are required to present our prior period financial results to reflect the equity method of accounting from the date of the initial investment in the company. Our results of operations include charges of $7.1 million, $5.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013. Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for more detailed discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense was $16.9 million in fiscal 2015. Our income tax benefit was $1.2 million and $7.8 million for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. The tax expense for fiscal 2015 was primarily a result of non-U.S. income taxes on income earned in foreign jurisdictions. The tax benefit in fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to a release of previously accrued taxes of approximately $8.3 million related to settlements with taxing authorities and the lapsing of statutes of limitations, primarily offset by income taxes associated with our non-U.S. operations. The tax benefit in fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to a release of previously accrued taxes of approximately $13.8 million related to settlements with taxing authorities and the lapsing of statutes of limitation, primarily offset by income taxes associated with our non-U.S. operations.\nOur effective tax rate varies from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries taxed at different rates and a full valuation allowance on net operating losses incurred in the U.S. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. We regularly assess our tax positions in light of legislative, bilateral tax treaty, regulatory and judicial developments in the many countries in which we and our affiliates do business.\nNon-U.S. tax authorities have completed their income tax examinations of our subsidiary in Israel for fiscal years 2008-2013 and our branch in Germany for fiscal years 2010 to 2013. Both Israel and Germany examinations did not result in material adjustments to our tax liabilities. Income tax examinations of our Malaysian subsidiary for the fiscal years 2007 to 2012 and our Thailand subsidiary for fiscal year 2010 are in progress. We do not believe the ultimate outcome of these examinations will result in a material increase to our tax liability.\nInternational revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the U.S. at rates ranging from 0% to 25%. The impact on our provision for income taxes of foreign income being taxed at rates different than the U.S. federal statutory rate was an expense of approximately $22.4 million, and benefit of $37.5 million and $15.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates as compared to the U.S. statutory federal rate that had the most significant impact on our provision for foreign income taxes in the periods presented include the Cayman Islands, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand.\nOn July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. On February 19, 2016, the Internal Revenue Service appealed the decision. A final decision has yet to be issued. At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the status of the current regulations, questions related to the scope of potential impact, and the risk of the Tax Court's decision being overturned upon appeal, we have not recorded any impact related to this issue as of January 3, 2016.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and working capital:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 227,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 322,376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Components of Cash Flows\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (79,087\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (42,156\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 193,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (43,453\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (45,023\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2015:\nOperating Activities\nIn fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $8.8 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $103.3 million in fiscal 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a net loss of $378.9 million adjusted for a net non-cash items of $293.6 million and a net cash provided by change in operating assets and liabilities of $96.4 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization of $243.8 million, stock based compensation expense of $93.5 million, non-cash restructuring charges of $8.6 million and, gain on the sale of our TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business of $66.5 million. The net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was due a decrease in inventories of $228.3 million offset by an increase in accounts receivables of $117.4 million, increase in other assets of $6.0 million, decrease in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities of $54.3 million and a decrease in deferred income of $14.2 million. The decrease in inventory was primarily due to $133.0 million of reserves recorded to write down inventory assumed from the Merger and was recognized as part of the Company's strategy to focus on high margin, profitable business as a combined company and to move away from the production and sale of inventory associated with non-strategic businesses.\nInvesting Activities\nIn fiscal 2015, we used $79.1 million of cash in our investing activities compared to $42.2 million in fiscal 2014. The cash we used in investing activities in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to $105.1 million in net cash paid on the Merger as part of purchase consideration, $47.2 million of cash used for property and equipment expenditures $28.0 million cash paid for equity investments and $6.1 million paid for a cost method investment. These increases were partially offset by $17.4 million of proceeds from the sales or maturities of investments and $98.6 million of cash proceeds from the sale of our TrueTouch\u00ae Mobile business, of the total cash proceeds received from the sale of our TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business, $10.0 million are held in an Escrow account until January 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nIn fiscal 2015, we generated $193.2 million of cash from our financing activities compared to $43.4 million in fiscal 2014. The cash we used in our financing activities in fiscal 2015 was primarily related our net borrowings on the revolving credit facility of $537.0 million, borrowings of $97.2 million on Term Loan A, net of costs, proceeds from settlement of capped calls which were assumed as part of the Merger of $25.3 million and net proceeds from the issuance of common shares under our employee stock plans of $52.3 million. The increases were offset by $315.0 million repayment of line of credit facility, $128.0 million of dividend payments, $55.1 million of repurchase of treasury stock and $9.6 million cash used for yield enhanced structured agreements settled in common stock.\nFiscal 2014:\nOperating Activities\nIn fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $103.3 million compared to $67.6 million in fiscal 2013. The increase in operating cash flows for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase in net income of $66.2 million compared to fiscal 2013. Our operating cash flow for 2014 of $103.3 million was primarily due to our net income of $16.5 million, net favorable non-cash adjustments to our net income including stock-based compensation of $50.2 million and depreciation and amortization of $46.7 million, and a net change in working capital of $15.7 million.\nInvesting Activities\nIn fiscal 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $42.2 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $0.3 million in fiscal 2013. The net cash used in our investing activities in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to investment purchases of $23.4 million, purchases of property and equipment of $20.9 million and investments made in other entities accounted for under the cost or equity method of accounting of $18.4 million, offset by the proceeds from sales of investments of $16.6 million.\nFinancing Activities\nIn fiscal 2014, net cash used in financing activities was $43.4 million compared to $45.0 million in fiscal 2013. The cash we used in our financing activities in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to payment of dividends of $69.2 million and the repayment of debt and obligations under capital leases of $6.3 million, offset by net proceeds of $32 million from the issuance of common shares under our employee stock plans.\nFiscal 2013:\nOperating Activities\nIn fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $67.6 million compared to $135 million in fiscal 2012. The decrease in operating cash flows for fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase in net loss of $24.8 million compared to fiscal 2012. Our operating cash flow for fiscal 2013 of $67.6 million was primarily due to our net loss of $50.1 million, offset by net favorable non-cash adjustments to our net loss including stock-based compensation of $73.0 million, depreciation and amortization of $48.4 million, and a net change in working capital of $20.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nIn fiscal 2013, net cash provided by investing activities was $0.3 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $113.0 million in fiscal 2012. The cash provided by our investing activities in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to sales of investments of $64.4 million offset by investment purchases of $23.1 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $36.6 million primarily for our Emerging Technologies Division.\nFinancing Activities\nIn fiscal 2013, net cash used in financing activities was $45.0 million compared to $58.5 million in fiscal 2012.

In connection with the approval of the new share repurchase plan, the share repurchase plan previously approved in September 2011 was terminated. The program allows us to purchase our common stock or enter into equity derivative transactions related to our common stock. The timing and actual amount expended with the new authorized funds will depend on a variety of factors including the market price of our common stock, regulatory, legal, and contractual requirements, alternatives uses of cash, availability of on shore cash and other market factors. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and may be modified or suspended at any time at our discretion. From September 2011 through the termination of the program, we used $327.4 million from the program to repurchase 24.4 million shares at an average share price of $13.4. Under the new program authorized in October, 2015 through the end of fiscal 2015, we used $56.5 million to repurchase 5.7 million share at an average price of $10.0.\nAs of February 26, 2016, we repurchased a total of 29.3 million shares for a total cost of $237.8 million under the new program. As of February 26, 2016, the total dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the program is approximately $212.2 million.\nYield Enhancement Program ( YEP\u201d):\nAs discussed under Item 5 above and in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, we have periodically entered into short term yield enhanced structured agreements since fiscal 2009.\nIn fiscal 2014, we entered into short-term yield enhanced structured agreements with maturities ranging from 30 to 45 days at an aggregate price of $19.4 million. Upon settlement of these agreements, we received $19.7 million in cash. In fiscal 2013 we didn't enter into any short-term yield enhanced structured agreements.\nIn fiscal 2015, we entered into a short-term yield enhanced structured agreements with maturities ranging from 10 to 30 days at an aggregate price of $38.6 million. Upon settlement of these agreements, we received $29.4 million in cash and one million shares at an average price of $9.60.\nSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\nOn October 17, 2013, we amended our credit facility to reduce the revolving commitments to $300 million. In connection with the reduction, certain financial covenants were amended. The amended financial covenants include the following conditions: 1) maximum senior secured leverage ratio of 2.50 to 1.00 through January 1, 2017 and 2.25 to 1.00 thereafter, 2) maximum total leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.00 through January 3, 2015, 3.5 to 1.00 through January 1, 2017 and 3.00 to 1.00 thereafter, 3) minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00, and 4) minimum liquidity of at least $100 million. Borrowings are collateralized by substantially all assets of the company.\nOn March 12, 2015, we amended and restated our existing senior secured revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility\u201d) and increased the size of the Credit Facility from $300 million to $450 million. The restated agreement also contains an option permitting us to arrange additional commitments of $250 million ( Incremental Availability\u201d) and specifies that the proceeds of these loans may be used for working capital, acquisitions, stock repurchases and general corporate purposes. The borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest, at the Company's option, at an adjusted base rate plus a spread of 1.25%, or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 2.25%. The borrowings under the Credit Facility are collateralized by substantially all of the Company's assets. The financial covenants were amended to include the following conditions: 1) maximum total leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 through January 1, 2017, and 3.00 to 1.00 thereafter, 2) minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00. At January 3, 2016, the Company's outstanding borrowings of $449.0 million were recorded as part of long-term liabilities and are presented as Long-term revolving credit facility and long term debt\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We incurred financing costs of $2.3 million to the new lenders of the Credit Facility which has been capitalized and recognized in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These costs will be amortized over the life of the Credit Facility.\nAs per the terms of the Credit Facility, we entered into a Joinder Agreement on December 22, 2015 under which we borrowed an additional $97.2 million ( Term Loan A\u201d), net of costs. Term Loan A is subject to, at the Company's option, either an interest rate equal to (i) 3.25% over LIBOR or (ii) an interest rate equal to 2.25% over the greater of (x) the prime lending rate published by the Wall Street Journal, (y) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (z) the LIBOR rate for a one month interest period plus 1%. The Company paid a 1.00% upfront fee in connection with the Term Loan A.\nThe Credit Facility, as amended, provides for a $450 million revolving credit facility and generally contains the same representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default that it contained prior to the effectiveness of the Amendment. The Amendment did not change the interest rate or maturity applicable to the Credit Facility and the Credit Facility remains guaranteed by certain present and future wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries (the Guarantors\u201d) and secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets and the Guarantors.\nOn January 6, 2016, we entered into an Incremental Revolving Joinder Agreement to our Credit Facility to increase the amount of revolving commitments under our Credit Facility by an additional $90 million. The total aggregate amount of revolving commitments under the Credit Facility starting January 6, 2016 is $540 million.\nThe proceeds of the loans made under the Credit Facility may be used for working capital, acquisitions, stock repurchases and general corporate purposes. As of the filing date of this Form 10-K, $449.5 million aggregate principal amount of loans and letters of credit are outstanding under the Credit Facility and none of the Incremental Availability has been used.\nAs of January 3, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the Credit Facility.\nRefer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for more information on our senior secured revolving credit facility.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 3, 2016:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 and 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 and 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> After 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 167,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 160,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equipment loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease commitments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2.00% Senior Exchangeable Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Term Loan A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments on debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 449,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 449,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License fee commitments (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,037,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 216,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 716,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Purchase obligations primarily include non-cancelable purchase orders for materials, services, manufacturing equipment, building improvements and supplies in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations are defined as enforceable agreements that are legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including quantity, price and timing. \n (2) Operating leases includes payments relating to Spansion's lease for office space in San Jose for a new headquarters entered on May 22, 2014, which is no longer required. The lease is for a period of 12 years, with two options to extend for periods of five years each after the initial lease term. The term of the lease commenced on January1, 2015 and expires on December 31, 2026. \n (3) On April 30, 2012, we entered into a patent license agreement whereby we paid a total patent license fee of $14.0 million in fiscal 2012 and committed to pay another $5.9 million on or before April 30, 2016 representing fees for future purchases of patents and patent related services. In June 2015, the Company paid an additional license fee of $18.5 million under the existing license agreement due to the merger with Spansion in March 2015. \nAs of January 3, 2016 our unrecognized tax benefits were $28.4 million, which were classified as long-term liabilities. We believe it is possible that we may recognize approximately $7 million of our existing unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months as a result of the lapse of statutes of limitations and the resolution of agreements with domestic and various foreign tax authorities.\nSale of Spansion's Sunnyvale property\nOn January 23, 2014, Spansion sold its property in Sunnyvale, California, consisting of 24.5 acres of land with approximately 471,000 square feet of buildings that included its headquarters building and submicron development center, a Pacific Gas & Electric transmission facility and a warehouse building, for net consideration of $59.0 million. Spansion concurrently leased back approximately 170,000 square feet of the headquarters building on a month-to-month basis with the option to continue the lease for up to 24 months; thereafter either party could terminate the lease. The first six months of the lease were rent free; thereafter the rents were lower than the market rates. For accounting purposes, these rents were deemed to have been netted against the sale proceeds and represent prepaid rent. As such, the use of the property after its sale constituted continuing involvement, and recognition of the sale of the property was deferred until the lease period ended. In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we terminated the lease on the Sunnyvale building and recognized an immaterial gain.\nEquity Investment Commitments\nAs disclosed in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have committed to purchase additional preferred stock from a company that operates in the area of advanced battery storage. During the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016, we purchased $28.0 million of preferred stock which was recorded as part of our investments in non-marketable securities. Subject to the attainment of certain milestones, we may purchase additional preferred stock of this company.\nCapital Resources and Financial Condition\nOur long-term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest-bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and debt securities, the purchase of our stock through our stock buyback program and payments of regularly scheduled cash dividends. In addition we may use excess cash to invest in our ETD, enter into strategic investments and partnerships and pursue acquisitions. As of January 3, 2016 in addition to $226.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, we had $0.9 million invested in short-term investments for a total cash and short-term investment position of $227.6 million that is available for use in current operations.\nAs of January 3, 2016, approximately 63.0% of our cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments are held outside of the United States. While these amounts are primarily invested in U.S. dollars, a portion is held in foreign currencies. All offshore balances are exposed to local political, banking, currency control and other risks. In addition, these amounts, if repatriated may be subject to tax and other transfer restrictions.\nWe believe that liquidity provided by existing cash, cash equivalents and investments and our borrowing arrangements will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, should prevailing economic conditions, debt covenants constraints, and/or financial, business and other factors beyond our control adversely affect our estimates of our future cash requirements, we could be required to fund our cash requirements by alternative financing. There can be no assurance that additional financing, if needed, would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. We may also choose at any time to raise additional capital or debt to strengthen our financial position, facilitate growth, enter into strategic initiatives including the acquisition of other companies, repurchases of shares of stock or increase our dividends or pay a special dividend and provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of other business opportunities that arise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Cypress uses non-GAAP measures to assess the following financial measures which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures:\n \u00b7 Revenue \n \u00b7 Gross margin \n \u00b7 Research and development expenses \n \u00b7 Selling, general and administrative expenses \n \u00b7 Operating income (loss) \n \u00b7 Net income (loss) \n \u00b7 Diluted net income (loss) per share \nThe non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges primarily related to Spansion merger costs and related amortization, which represented approximately 83% of total adjustments for the year ended January 3, 2016 as well as stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Cypress's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Cypress's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Cypress's business and operations. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision-making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to Cypress's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G and to make clear to our investors the adjustments we make to GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands, except per shares amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,626,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 725,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 722,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 573,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 381,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 377,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 252,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 147,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 161,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 137,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 90,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 96,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP pretax profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 91,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP net income attributable to Cypress\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP diluted net income per share attributable to\nCypress\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that providing these Non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, are useful to investors because they allow investors to see our results through the eyes\u201d of management as these Non-GAAP financial measures reflect our internal measurement processes. Management believes that these Non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of our operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis and provides investors with another method for assessing our operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of our ongoing operations.\nCYPRESS SEMICONDUCTOR

\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the data used to prepare them. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and we are required to make estimates, judgments and assumptions in the course of such preparation. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, inventory valuation, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and financial instruments, stock-based compensation, and settlement costs, and income taxes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies that are affected by significant estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition:\nWe generate revenues by selling products to distributors, various types of manufacturers including original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d) and electronic manufacturing service providers ( EMSs\u201d). We recognize revenue on sales to OEMs and EMSs provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, title has transferred, collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, there are no customer acceptance requirements, and there are no remaining significant obligations.\nSales to certain distributors are made under agreements which provide the distributors with price protection, stock rotation and other allowances under certain circumstances. When we determine that the uncertainties associated with the rights given to these distributors, revenues and costs related to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the end customers. In those circumstances, revenues are recognized upon receiving notification from the distributors that products have been sold to the end customers. In these cases, at the time of shipment to distributors, we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to receive payment, relieves inventory for the value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributors, and defers the related margin and price adjustment as deferred income on sales to distributors on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any effects of distributor price adjustments are recorded as a reduction to deferred income at the time the distributors sell the products to the end customers and the distributor submits a valid claim for the price adjustment.\nWe have historically recognized a significant portion of revenue through distributors at the time the distributor resold the product to its end customer (also referred to as the sell-through basis of revenue recognition) given the difficulty in estimating the ultimate price of these product shipments and amount of potential returns. We continuously reassesses our ability to reliably estimate the ultimate price of these products and, over the past several years, have made investments in our systems and process around our distribution channel to improve the quality of the information it receives from our distributors. Given these ongoing investments, and based on the financial framework for estimating potential price adjustments, beginning the fourth quarter of 2014, we concluded that we were able to reasonable estimate returns and pricing concessions on certain product families and with certain distributors, and we recognized revenue at the time it shipped these specific products to the identified distributors, less its estimate of future price adjustments and returns. As a result of this change, we recognized an incremental $12.3 million of revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. The impact of this change resulted in an increase of $6.2 million to net income attributable to Cypress for fiscal 2014, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share. During fiscal 2015, we recognized $40.9 million of incremental revenue from this change, which resulted in a decrease in net loss of $25.0 million or $0.07 per basic and diluted shares. During fiscal 2015, we recognized $780.8 million or 68% of distribution revenue on a sell-in basis.\nWe record as a reduction to revenues reserves for sales returns, price protection and allowances, based upon historical experience rates and for any specific known customer amounts. We also provide certain distributors and EMSs with volume-pricing discounts, such as rebates and incentives, which are recorded as a reduction to revenues at the time of sale. Historically these volume discounts have not been significant.\nOur revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent, accurate and timely data from our distributors. Distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product, price, quantity, and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock. Because the data set is large and complex and because there may be errors in the reported data, we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors' reported inventories to their activities. Actual results could vary materially from those estimates.\nBusiness Combinations:\nWe apply the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d), in the accounting for acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Accounting for business combinations requires the Company's management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates it has made have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts Receivable:\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers' inability to make required payments. We make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by considering factors such as historical bad debt experience, specific customer creditworthiness, the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic trends that may affect a customer's ability to pay. If the data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our results of operations could be materially affected.\nValuation of Inventories:\nManagement periodically reviews the adequacy of our inventory reserves. We record a write-down for our inventories which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. We perform a detailed review of inventories each quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans and current sales levels. Inventory reserves are not relieved until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped. Our inventories may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and are sold in a highly competitive industry. If there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to record additional write-downs, and our gross margin could be adversely affected. In fiscal 2015, we recorded approximately $133 million of inventory reserves to write down inventory assumed as part of the merger.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets:\nOur business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities and equipment that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly under-utilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand. In addition, we have recorded intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions.\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our business, significant negative industry or economic trends, and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time. Impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value, and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analysis. If there is a significant adverse change in our business in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges on our long-lived assets.\nValuation of Goodwill:\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We assess our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. In accordance with ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, qualitative factors can be assessed to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test for goodwill impairment. If we believe, as a result of our qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required.\nWe have four reporting units of which two, Memory Products division (MPD) and Programmable Systems Division (PSD), have goodwill. Determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are also unpredictable and inherently uncertain.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended January 3, 2016 were as follows:\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> MPD\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> PSD\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill as of December 28, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill from merger with Spansion (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 739,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 937,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,676,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Measurement period adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,850\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,850\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill as of January 3, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 770,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 968,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,738,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Refer Note 2 for further details. \nOn the first day of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment using the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.\nWe estimated the fair values of our reporting units using a combination of the income and market approach. These valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, forecasted financial information, growth rates, terminal or residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\nThe income approach utilizes estimates of discounted future cash flows. Key assumptions used in the market approach include the selection of appropriate benchmark companies and the selection of an appropriate market value multiple for each reporting unit based on a comparison of the reporting unit with the benchmark companies as of the impairment testing date.\nIn performing our 2015 assessment, we applied a weighting of 75% to the income approach and 25% to the market approach. Given that the reporting units are transitioning out of a period of declining revenue and profit, we believe the income approach is a better indication of the going concern value of the reporting units as it better captures the expected improvement in revenue and profit. As such, we placed more weighing on the income approach. Furthermore, as the market approach reflected general macroeconomic concerns that were evidenced in valuations for multiple publicly traded companies, the Company concluded this approach was not as relevant to the impairment calculation.\nBased on our goodwill impairment testing, we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill. The fair value of our MPD reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 53% and the fair value of our PSD reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 9%. As a result, if we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit, it would have resulted in the fair value of our PSD reporting unit being less than its carrying value. As an overall test of the reasonableness of estimated fair values of our two reporting units, we reconciled the combined fair value estimates of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of the valuation date. The reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were relatively representative of the market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization. However, any significant reductions in the actual amount of future cash flows realized by our reporting units, reductions in the value of market comparables, or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair values of our reporting units. Such events could ultimately result in a material charge to our results of operations in future periods due to the potential for a write-down of the goodwill associated with our reporting units.\nBased on our testing, we determined that there was a risk of our PSD reporting unit failing the first step of goodwill impairment test in future periods. For this reporting unit, the underlying assumptions we used in assessing fair value include, but are not limited to, declines in our stock price or our peers' stock prices, relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or small changes in other key assumptions, such as revenue growth rates and discount rates. Specifically, the income approach valuation for PSD included the following assumptions for 2015:\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 3, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk free rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Peer company beta\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur PSD reporting unit is highly sensitive to management's plans for increasing sales and gross margins by expanding PSOC 3/4/5 and the Automotive business as well as the achievement of our cost reduction initiatives. If the actual revenue growth and profitability improvements forecasted for the PSD reporting unit do not achieve the levels we estimated in assessing the fair value of the PSD reporting unit, the fair value of the PSD reporting unit may decline. A future decline in the fair value of the PSD reporting unit may result in the recognition of an impairment charge to our earnings as a result of a write-down of the value of the goodwill associated with that reporting unit.\nOur next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed on the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. Such indicators include, but are not limited to, challenging economic conditions, such as a decline in our operating results, an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions. Such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a decrease in fair value and require us to record goodwill impairment charges.\nIn fiscal 2014, we elected to perform a qualitative analysis for impairment on goodwill rather than to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. We assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. After assessing many qualitative factors pertinent to our Company we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: 1) change in the industry and competitive environment, 2) market capitalization, 3) stock price and 4) overall financial performance. Based on the results of the testing, no goodwill impairment was recognized in fiscal 2014.\nIn fiscal 2013, we elected to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Based on the results of the testing, no goodwill impairment was recognized in 2013.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments:\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Our financial assets and financial liabilities that require recognition under the guidance generally include available-for-sale investments, employee deferred compensation plan and foreign currency derivatives. The guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. As such, fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity-specific measure. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:\n \u00b7 Level 1 includes instruments for which quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Our financial assets utilizing Level 1 inputs include U.S. treasuries, money market funds, marketable equity securities and our employee deferred compensation plan assets with the exception of our stable value funds which are considered Level 2 instruments. \n \u00b7 Level 2 includes instruments for which the valuations are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets consist of certain marketable debt instruments for which values are determined using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Our Level 2 instruments include certain U.S. government securities, commercial paper, corporate notes and bonds, assets held-for-sale and our employee deferred compensation plan liabilities and our stable value funds included in our deferred compensation plan assets. \n \u00b7 Level 3 includes valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. Financial assets utilizing Level 3 inputs primarily include auction rate securities. We do not have any financial assets or liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs. \nCash Flow Hedges:\nThe Company enters into cash flow hedges to protect non-functional currency revenues, inventory purchases and certain other operational expenses against variability in cash flows due to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company's foreign currency forward contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges have maturities between three and nine months. All hedging relationships are formally documented, and the hedges are designed to offset changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions at the inception of the hedge. The Company recognizes derivative instruments from hedging activities as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures them at fair value on a monthly basis. The Company records changes in the intrinsic value of its cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. Interest charges or forward points\u201d on the forward contracts are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recorded in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. When the forecasted transaction occurs, the Company reclassifies the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue or costs, depending on the risk hedged. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the Company will reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income (expense), net in its Consolidated Statements of Operations at that time.\nThe Company evaluates hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively and records any ineffective portion of the hedge in other income (expense), net in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer Note 11 for further details on cash flow and balance sheet hedges.\nStock-Based Compensation:\nUnder the fair value recognition provisions of the guidance, we recognize stock-based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the awards. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including measurement of level of achievement of performance milestones, the expected life of the share-based payment awards and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our future stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded.\nEmployee Benefit Plans:\nIn connection with the Merger, we assumed the Spansion Innovates Group Cash Balance Plan (a defined benefit pension plan) in Japan. A defined benefit pension plan is accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions such as turnover rates, discount rates and other factors. The discount rate assumption is determined by comparing the projected benefit payments to the Japanese corporate bonds yield curve as of end of the most recently completed fiscal year. The benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation (PBO), which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement. This liability is recorded in other long term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net periodic pension cost is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and includes service cost. Service cost represents the actuarial present value of participant benefits earned in the current year. Interest cost represents the time value of money associated with the passage of time on the PBO. Gains or losses resulting from a change in the PBO if actual results differ from actuarial assumptions will be accumulated and amortized over the future life of the plan participants if they exceed 10% of the PBO, being the corridor amount. If the amount of a net gain or loss does not exceed the corridor amount, it will be recorded to other comprehensive income (loss). See Note 17 for further details of the pension plans.\nAccounting for Income Taxes:\nOur global operations involve manufacturing, research and development and selling activities. Profits from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country taxes but are not subject to U.S. tax until repatriated to the U.S. United States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. Should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. This adjustment would increase income in the period such determination is made.\nThe calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to expense would result.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended that involve risks and uncertainties, which are discussed under Item 1A.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nGeneral\nCypress Semiconductor Corporation ( Cypress\u201d) delivers high-performance, high-quality solutions at the heart of today's most advanced embedded systems, from automotive, industrial and networking platforms to highly interactive consumer and mobile devices.

( Spansion\u201d) pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, as of December 1, 2014 (the Merger Agreement\u201d), for a total consideration of approximately $2.8 billion. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, Spansion shareholders received 2.457 Cypress shares for each Spansion share they owned. The Merger has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Topic 805, Business Combinations, with Cypress treated as the accounting acquirer. The post-Merger company is expected to realize more than $160 million in cost synergies on an annualized basis within two years, and create a leading global provider of microcontrollers and specialized memories needed in today's embedded systems.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes the financial results of legacy Spansion beginning March 12, 2015. The comparability of our operating results for the year ended January 3, 2016 to the same period in fiscal 2014 is significantly impacted by our Merger. In our discussion and analysis of comparative periods, we have quantified the contribution of additional revenue or expense resulting from this transaction wherever such amounts were material and identifiable. While identified amounts may provide indications of general trends, the analysis cannot completely address the effects attributable to integration efforts.\nDivestiture of TrueTouch\u00ae Business\nOn August 1, 2015, we completed the sale of the TrueTouch\u00ae mobile touchscreen business, which is a business unit within our Programmable Systems Division, to Parade Technologies ( Parade\u201d) for total cash proceeds of $98.6 million pursuant to the definitive agreement signed on June 11, 2015. Of the total cash proceeds, $10.0 million are held in an escrow account until January 2017 subject to any indemnity claims on post-closing adjustments, per the terms of the agreement. Post-sale, Cypress will continue to provide TrueTouch\u00ae solutions to its automotive, industrial and home appliance customers and to its mobile customers. In connection with the transaction, we sold certain assets associated with the disposed business mostly consisting of inventory with a net book value of $10.5 million and recognized a gain of $66.5 million in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2015. This gain has been presented as a separate line item Gain on divestiture of TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAlso in connection with the transaction, we entered into a Manufacturing Service Agreement (MSA) in which we agreed to sell finished wafers and devices to Parade during the one-year period following the close of the transaction. The terms of the MSA indicated that we would sell finished products to Parade at agreed-upon prices that were considered below fair market value, indicating that there was an embedded fair value that would be realized by Parade through those terms. Accordingly, we have allocated $19.9 million from the $98.6 million proceeds to the fair value of the MSA based on the forecasted wafer sales to Parade for the subsequent one-year period. Such amount was deferred on our consolidated balance sheet initially and is being amortized to revenue as we sell products to Parade. During the year ended January 3, 2016, we recognized $5.7 million of revenue from amortization of such deferred revenue.\nAs of the end of fiscal 2015, our organization included the following business segments:\n Business Segments Description PSD: Programmable Systems Division PSD focuses on high-performance, programmable solutions. The programmable portfolio includes high-performance Traveo\u2122 automotive microcontrollers, PSoC\u00ae programmable system-on-chip products, ARM\u00ae Cortex\u00ae-M4, -M3, -M0+ microcontrollers and R4 CPUs, analog PMIC Power Management ICs, CapSense\u00ae capacitive-sensing controllers, TrueTouch\u00ae touchscreen and fingerprint reader products, and PSoC Bluetooth Low Energy solutions for the IoT. PSD added Spansion's microcontroller and analog products starting March 12, 2015. MPD: Memory Products Division MPD focuses on high-performance parallel and serial NOR flash memories, NAND flash memories, static random access memory (SRAM), and high-reliability F-RAM\u2122 ferroelectric memory devices. Its purpose is to enhance our position in these products and invent new products and derivatives. MPD added Spansion's Flash memory products starting March 12, 2015. DCD: Data Communications Division DCD focuses on USB controllers, Bluetooth\u00ae Low Energy solutions that leverage Cypress's PRoC\u2122 programmable radio-on-chip technology, WirelessUSB\u2122 solutions, module solutions such as trackpads and Bluetooth Low Energy modules, and controllers for the new USB Type-C standard, which enables data transmission and power delivery over a single cable with a slimmer plug. DCD focuses primarily on industrial, handset and consumer electronics markets and applications. ETD: Emerging Technologies Division Also known as our startup\u201d division, ETD includes subsidiaries AgigA Tech Inc. and Deca Technologies Inc., as well as our foundry business and other development-stage activities. \nOur primary focus is profitable growth in our key markets. With the addition of the legacy Spansion business, we plan to capitalize on our expanded product portfolio and leadership positions in embedded processing and specialized memories to significantly extend our penetration of global markets such as automotive, industrial, communications, consumer, computation, data communications, mobile handsets and military. Our revenue model is based on the following product and market strategies: (a) increasing market share in our memory products by leveraging our market position and expanding our portfolio with new and complementary products, (b) growing revenue from our high-performance, programmable solutions and derivatives including PSoC programmable system-on-chip products and microcontrollers in the automotive and industrial markets, (c) increasing our DCD revenue through the introduction of new products such as USB Type-C solutions, SuperSpeed USB 3.0 peripheral controllers and Bluetooth\u00ae Low Energy solutions that leverage Cypress's PRoC\u2122 programmable radio-on-chip technology for the IoT and other applications, and (d) revenue growth from ETD, which includes our internal startup companies. For profitability, our focus is to integrate the acquired Spansion business successfully and realize the anticipated product cost and operational cost synergies. Our integration effort includes the re-focusing of portions of legacy Spansion business to higher-margin opportunities, particularly in the Flash memory business. We monitor our operating expenses closely to improve our operating leverage as driven by various company-wide initiatives, including our World Class Cost program to continuously reduce cost line items as well as a Human Resources effort to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency across the company.\nIn order to achieve our goals on revenue growth and profitability, Cypress will continue to pursue the following strategies:\n \u00b7 Successfully integrate our business with Spansion. We are committed to integrating the business of Cypress and Spansion successfully to realize the anticipated cost synergies and improve the bottom line. \n \u00b7 Cross-sell products from Cypress's expanded product portfolio in the wake of the Spansion Merger. We will continue to take advantage of product and business synergies and grow our top-line revenue. \n \u00b7 Focus on large and growing markets. We will continue to pursue business opportunities in large and growing markets, particularly the automotive and industrial markets. \n \u00b7 Drive profitability. Cypress has implemented and maintained a tight, corporate wide focus on gross margin and operating expenses. We are committed to maintaining our current strong operating expense management without compromising our new product development and investments in our Emerging Technologies Division. \n \u00b7 Drive programmable technologies, extend our leadership in programmable products and drive PSoC and microcontroller proliferation. We will continue to define, design and develop new programmable products and solutions that offer our customers increased flexibility and efficiency, higher performance, and higher levels of integration with a focus on analog functionality. We will continue to drive PSoC and microcontroller adoption in our key market segments. \n \u00b7 Collaborate with customers to build system-level solutions. We work closely with our customers from initial product design through manufacturing and delivery to optimize their design efforts, help them achieve product differentiation, improve their time-to-market and help them to develop whole product solutions. \n \u00b7 Leverage flexible manufacturing. Our manufacturing strategy combines capacity from leading foundries with output from our internal manufacturing facilities. This enables us to meet rapid swings in customer demand while reducing the burden of high fixed costs. \n \u00b7 Identify and exit legacy or non-strategic, underperforming businesses. We will continue to monitor and, if necessary, to exit certain business units that are inconsistent with our future initiatives and long-term financial plans so that we can focus our resources and efforts on our core programmable and proprietary business model. The sale of our TrueTouch\u00ae mobile touchscreen business to Parade Technologies, Ltd. during the third quarter of 2015 is an example of this business strategy. \n \u00b7 Pursue complementary strategic relationships. We will continue to assess opportunities to develop strategic relationships through acquisitions, investments, licensing and joint development projects. We also will continue to make significant investments in current ventures as well as new ventures. \nAs we continue to implement our strategies, there are many internal and external factors that could impact our ability to meet any or all of our objectives. Some of these factors are discussed under Item 1A.\nManufacturing Strategy\nOur core manufacturing strategy-\u201dflexible manufacturing\u201d-combines capacity from foundries with output from our internal manufacturing facilities. This strategy is intended to allow us to meet rapid swings in customer demand while lessening the burden of high fixed costs, a capability that is particularly important in high-volume consumer markets that we serve with our leading programmable product portfolio.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenues\nOur total revenues increased by $882.4 million or 121.6% to $1,607.9 million for the year ended January 3, 2016 compared to the prior year. For the year ended January 3, 2016, $962.3 million of the increase was attributable to revenue contributions from the acquired Spansion business which is included in the PSD and MPD divisions. The overall increase was partially offset by decrease in revenue from TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business as a result of divestiture of the business on August 1, 2015. The overall average selling price of our products, including Spansion products, for the year ended January 3, 2016 was $1.09. Excluding Spansion products, our ASP for the year ended January 3, 2016 was $1.14, which increased by $0.05 compared with the same period in the prior year.\nThe Company operates on a 52 or 53 week year ending on the Sunday nearest to December 31. Fiscal 2014 and 2013 were each 52 weeks and fiscal 2015 was a 53-week year, with the extra week in the fourth fiscal quarter. The additional week in 2015 did not materially affect the Company's results of operations or financial position.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, moderate pricing pressure in certain product lines, primarily due to competitive conditions. We have in the past been able to, and expect in the future to be able to, moderate average selling price declines in our product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices. We may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nConsistent with our accounting policies and generally accepted accounting principles, we have historically recognized a significant portion of revenue through distributors at the time the distributor resold the product to its end customer (also referred to as the sell-through basis of revenue recognition) given the difficulty in estimating the ultimate price of these product shipments and amount of potential returns. We continually reassess our ability to reliably estimate the ultimate price of these products and, over the past several years, we have made investments in our systems and processes around our distribution channel to improve the quality of the information we receive from our distributors. Given these ongoing investments, and based on the financial framework we use for estimating potential price adjustments, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, we concluded that we have become able to reasonably estimate returns and pricing concessions on certain product families and with certain distributors, and recognized revenue at the time we shipped these specific products to the identified distributors, less our estimate of future price adjustments and returns. During the year ended January 3, 2016, we recognized an incremental $40.9 million of revenue on additional product families for which revenue was previously recognized on a sell-through basis as we determined that we could reasonably estimate returns and pricing concessions at the time of shipment to distributors. This change resulted in a decrease to the net loss of $25.0 million for the year ended January 3, 2016 or $0.07 per basic and diluted share.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated revenues by segments:\n\nProgrammable Systems Division:\nRevenues from the Programmable Systems Division in fiscal 2015 increased by $330.7 million or 116.8% compared to fiscal 2014. The increase in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the $402.3 million of revenue contribution from the Spansion microcontroller and analog business for fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact of Spansion revenues, PSD decreased by $71.6 million for fiscal 2015, or 25.3%, compared to the prior year primarily due to weakness in our end customers' handset/mobile business demand, decrease in revenue from TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business as a result of divestiture of the business on August 1, 2015 and incremental revenue in fiscal 2014 as a result of the change in accounting for certain distributor revenues. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of PSD products to the automotive applications, where we experienced a ramp in volume from recent design wins.\nRevenues from the Programmable Systems Division in fiscal 2014 decreased by $9.5 million or 3.2% compared to fiscal 2013. The revenue decrease in fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to declines in sales of our TrueTouch\u00ae touchscreen products due to a decrease in revenue from our handset customers and lower average selling prices. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales of PSD products to industrial and automotive customers where we experienced a ramp in volume from new design wins. Fiscal 2014 revenue also included $8.2 million of incremental revenue as a result of the change in accounting for certain distributor revenues as discussed above.\nMemory Products Division:\nRevenues from the Memory Products Division increased in fiscal 2015 by $523.8 million or 150.6% compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to $560.0 million of revenue contribution from the Spansion flash memory business for fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact of Spansion revenues, MPD decreased by $36.2 million or 10.4% in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year primarily driven by sales decrease in the communication market segment.\nRevenues from the Memory Products Division in fiscal 2014 increased by $8.9 million or 2.6% as compared to fiscal 2013, primarily due to an increase in sales of nonvolatile products associated with our acquisition of Ramtron in fiscal 2012, offset by a decrease in SRAM products driven by a continuing decrease in demand from wireless and wireline end customers. Fiscal 2014 revenue also included $4.1 million of incremental revenue as a result of the change in accounting for certain distributor revenues as discussed above.\nData Communications Division:\nRevenue for the Data Communication Division in fiscal 2015 increased by $2.4 million or 3.4% compared to fiscal 2014 due to increasing revenue in our super speed USB products, offset by a decline in our trackpad products..\nRevenue for the Data Communication Division in fiscal 2014 decreased by $9.0 million or 11.4% compared to fiscal 2013 due to declining revenue in our legacy high-speed USB controllers, optical navigation and trackpad products.\nEmerging Technologies and Other:\nRevenues from the Emerging Technologies Division increased by $25.5 million or 106.2% in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to the overall increase in demand at all of our Emerging Technologies companies. The increase was also attributable to increase in our Foundry revenues as we began selling products to Parade Technologies in August 2015 under the Manufacturing Services Agreement, which was signed in connection with our disposition of TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business.\nRevenue from the Emerging Technologies Division in fiscal 2014 increased by $12.4 million or 107.3% compared to fiscal 2013 due to increased revenue in all three business - Deca Tech, Agiga Tech and our foundry business. The increase is due to the overall increase in demand as certain of our Emerging Technologies companies begin to ramp production with new customer design wins.\nCost of Revenues/Gross Margin\n\nGross margin consists of Revenues less Cost of revenues, and gross margin percentage is percentage of gross margin to revenue. Our gross margin can vary in any period depending on factors such as the mix of types of products sold and the impact of changes to inventory provisions, such as the write-down of inventory. Our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell, which is often difficult to estimate with accuracy. Therefore, if we achieve significant revenue growth in our lower margin product lines, or if we are unable to earn as much revenue as we expect from higher margin product lines, our gross margin may be negatively impacted.\nGross margin percentage declined to 24.9% in fiscal 2015 from 50.1% in fiscal 2014. The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to impact of the merger with Spansion, which historically had lower gross margins than Cypress, and $133.0 million of additional inventory reserves which were recorded on inventory assumed as a part of the Merger. The additional reserves on inventory were recognized as part of our strategy to focus on high margin, profitable business as a combined company. Total charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions, including reserves on inventory assumed as part of the Merger, totaled $152.5 million for fiscal 2015 and $19.8 million for fiscal 2014, unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 9.5% and 3.0%, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $6.4 million for fiscal 2015 and $3.7 million for fiscal 2014, favorably impacting our gross margin by 0.4% and 1.0%, respectively. Our gross margin for fiscal 2015 was also impacted by $84.4 million of amortization of fair value adjustments, net of reserves, relating to acquired legacy Spansion inventory.\nGross margin percentage increased to 50.1% in fiscal 2014 from 46.8% in fiscal 2013 primarily driven by lower cost of revenue expenses associated with the inventory acquired in the Ramtron acquisition, higher factory absorption and product and customer mix. Charges to cost of revenue for inventory reserve provisions were $19.8 million during fiscal 2014 and $12.8 million for fiscal 2013, unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 3% and 2%, respectively. The benefit realized from sales of inventory previously reserved were $3.7 million and $5.1 million for fiscal year 2014 and fiscal 2013, favorably impacting our gross margin by 1% and 1%, respectively.\nResearch and Development ( R&D\u201d)\n\nR&D expenditures increased by $116.8 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was mainly attributable to $108.3 million of additional expenses due to the Merger, primarily comprised of $63.0 million of labor costs due to additional headcount, $24.0 million of building, repairs and other overhead expenses, $7.7 million of material costs on R&D projects, $8.5 million of professional services related to Information technology and other outside services and $9.5 million of increase in stock-based compensation expense.\nR&D expenditures decreased by $26.3 million in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $9.9 million in stock-based compensation and a decrease of $1.0 million in deferred compensation expense. There was an additional decrease in consulting fees and other outside services of $2.9 million and $10.0 million, respectively, as a result of a worldwide cost cutting effort. As a percentage of revenues, R&D expenses were lower in fiscal 2014 driven by the decrease in total expense in the same period.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d)\n\nSG&A expenses increased by $152.8 million in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was mainly due to $99.6 million of expenses from the Merger, primarily comprised of $50.0 million of labor costs due to additional headcount, $39.0 million of building, supplies, repairs and other overhead expenses, and $15.0 million of professional services expense related to information technology, legal and finance. Additionally, we also incurred $17.4 million of costs for professional fees for legal and audit services related to the Merger integration activities, $5.0M of termination costs on legacy Spansion patent license agreement and $30.6 million of increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily related to the 2015 PARS grants.\nSG&A expenses decreased by $11.9 million in fiscal 2014 or 6.5% compared to fiscal 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in stock-based compensation of $13.4 million, a $7.9 million decrease in headcount related expenditures, a $2.0 million decrease in deferred compensation expense, a $1.6 million decrease in variable bonus-related expense, offset by $7.3 million of acquisition related expenditures associated with our proposed merger with Spansion, an increase of $2.7 million in legal fees and $1.3 million in accrued estimated legal settlements.\nAmortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets\nDuring fiscal 2015, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets increased by $101.7 million compared to fiscal 2014. The increase is primarily due to the amortization on the intangibles acquired in connection with the Merger.\nDuring fiscal 2014, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets decreased by $1.1 million compared to fiscal 2013. The decrease is primarily related to certain intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2012 that were fully amortized during fiscal 2013.\nRestructuring\nIn March 2015, we began the implementation of planned cost reduction and restructuring activities in connection with the Merger. As part of this Spansion integration-related restructuring plan, we expect to eliminate approximately 1,000 positions from the combined workforce across all business and functional areas on a global basis. The restructuring charge of $90.1 million recorded for the year ended January 3, 2016 primarily consists of severance costs, lease termination costs and impairment of property, plant and equipment. The lease termination costs include approximately $18 million relating to the buildings Spansion had leased prior to the Merger, which we decided not to occupy in the post-Merger period. The initial term of the lease commenced on January 1, 2015 and will expire on December 31, 2026.\nThe following table summarizes the restructuring charges recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods presented pursuant to the Spansion Integration-Related Restructuring Plan:\n\nWe anticipate that the remaining restructuring accrual balance will be paid out in cash through 2016 for employee terminations and over the remaining lease term through 2026 for the excess lease obligation.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we have realized approximately $137.7 million of synergy savings on an annualized basis from the restructuring actions taken. Upon completion of all of our actions, we anticipate our annualized synergy savings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to be approximately $160 million. When complete, we estimate approximately 40% of the savings will impact cost of goods sold and the remaining 60% will impact operating expenses. There can be no assurance that we will achieve these anticipated savings.\nGain on Divestiture of TruTouch\u00ae Mobile Business\nIn connection with the sale of the TrueTouch\u00ae mobile touchscreen business to Parade for total cash proceeds of $98.6 million, we sold certain assets associated with the disposed business mostly consisting of inventory with a net book value of $10.5 million and recognized a gain of $66.5 million in fiscal 2015, net of the amount of gain deferred in connection with an ongoing manufacturing service agreement we entered into with Parade in connection with the divestiture.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for fiscal 2015 was $16.4 million and represents accretion of interest expense on 2.00% Senior Exchangeable Notes, interest expense incurred on our revolving line of credit, Term Loan A and other debt.\nInterest expense for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 was $5.8 million and $8.1 million, respectively, and represents interest expense incurred on our revolving line of credit and other term debt.\nRefer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for more information about our credit facilities.\nOther Income (expense), Net\nThe following table summarizes the components of other income (expense), net:\n\nEmployee Deferred Compensation Plan\nWe have a deferred compensation plan, which provides certain key employees, including our executive management, with the ability to defer the receipt of compensation in order to accumulate funds for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. We do not make contributions to the deferred compensation plan and we do not guarantee returns on the investments. Participant deferrals and investment gains and losses remain as our liabilities and the underlying assets are subject to claims of general creditors. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized changes in fair value of the assets under the deferred compensation plan in Other income (expense), net\u201d of $1.4 million of interest expense, $3.0 million and $6.4 million of interest income, respectively. The increase or decrease in the fair value of the investments relates to the increased or decreased performance of the portfolio on a year over year basis. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for more information about our deferred compensation plan.\nGain on Sale of Investments in Marketable Equity Securities\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we sold our investment in a certain marketable equity security for $2.2 million, which resulted in a realized gain of $1.1 million.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Ramtron, we recognized a gain of $1.7 million on our initial investment in Ramtron of $3.4 million. For more information about our acquisition, refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8.\nUnrealized loss on marketable securities\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased 6.9 million ordinary shares of Hua Hong Semiconductor Limited (HHSL) for an aggregate price of $10.0 million in connection with their initial public offering. HHSL is the parent company of Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, which is one of our strategic foundry partners. We recorded an unrealized loss on our investment in HHSL's ordinary shares of $4.7 million and $1.5 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, as a result of the decline in the fair market value of the investment.\nEquity in Net Loss of Equity Method Investee\nDuring fiscal 2015, we invested an additional $28.0 million in a battery company. The additional investment in this company increased our ownership interest in the company's outstanding stock from 26.2% as of December 28, 2014 to 38.7% as of January 3, 2016. We have accounted for our investment in this entity under the equity method of accounting since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, when we changed from the cost method of accounting to the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, we are required to record our interest in the investee's reported net income or loss for each reporting period. Additionally, we are required to present our prior period financial results to reflect the equity method of accounting from the date of the initial investment in the company. Our results of operations include charges of $7.1 million, $5.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively, for the fiscal years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013. Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for more detailed discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense was $16.9 million in fiscal 2015. Our income tax benefit was $1.2 million and $7.8 million for fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. The tax expense for fiscal 2015 was primarily a result of non-U.S. income taxes on income earned in foreign jurisdictions. The tax benefit in fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to a release of previously accrued taxes of approximately $8.3 million related to settlements with taxing authorities and the lapsing of statutes of limitations, primarily offset by income taxes associated with our non-U.S. operations. The tax benefit in fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to a release of previously accrued taxes of approximately $13.8 million related to settlements with taxing authorities and the lapsing of statutes of limitation, primarily offset by income taxes associated with our non-U.S. operations.\nOur effective tax rate varies from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to earnings of foreign subsidiaries taxed at different rates and a full valuation allowance on net operating losses incurred in the U.S. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. We regularly assess our tax positions in light of legislative, bilateral tax treaty, regulatory and judicial developments in the many countries in which we and our affiliates do business.\nNon-U.S. tax authorities have completed their income tax examinations of our subsidiary in Israel for fiscal years 2008-2013 and our branch in Germany for fiscal years 2010 to 2013. Both Israel and Germany examinations did not result in material adjustments to our tax liabilities. Income tax examinations of our Malaysian subsidiary for the fiscal years 2007 to 2012 and our Thailand subsidiary for fiscal year 2010 are in progress. We do not believe the ultimate outcome of these examinations will result in a material increase to our tax liability.\nInternational revenues account for a significant portion of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the U.S. at rates ranging from 0% to 25%. The impact on our provision for income taxes of foreign income being taxed at rates different than the U.S. federal statutory rate was an expense of approximately $22.4 million, and benefit of $37.5 million and $15.4 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates as compared to the U.S. statutory federal rate that had the most significant impact on our provision for foreign income taxes in the periods presented include the Cayman Islands, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand.\nOn July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. On February 19, 2016, the Internal Revenue Service appealed the decision. A final decision has yet to be issued. At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the status of the current regulations, questions related to the scope of potential impact, and the risk of the Tax Court's decision being overturned upon appeal, we have not recorded any impact related to this issue as of January 3, 2016.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and working capital:\n\nKey Components of Cash Flows\n\nFiscal 2015:\nOperating Activities\nIn fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $8.8 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $103.3 million in fiscal 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a net loss of $378.9 million adjusted for a net non-cash items of $293.6 million and a net cash provided by change in operating assets and liabilities of $96.4 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization of $243.8 million, stock based compensation expense of $93.5 million, non-cash restructuring charges of $8.6 million and, gain on the sale of our TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business of $66.5 million. The net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was due a decrease in inventories of $228.3 million offset by an increase in accounts receivables of $117.4 million, increase in other assets of $6.0 million, decrease in accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities of $54.3 million and a decrease in deferred income of $14.2 million. The decrease in inventory was primarily due to $133.0 million of reserves recorded to write down inventory assumed from the Merger and was recognized as part of the Company's strategy to focus on high margin, profitable business as a combined company and to move away from the production and sale of inventory associated with non-strategic businesses.\nInvesting Activities\nIn fiscal 2015, we used $79.1 million of cash in our investing activities compared to $42.2 million in fiscal 2014. The cash we used in investing activities in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to $105.1 million in net cash paid on the Merger as part of purchase consideration, $47.2 million of cash used for property and equipment expenditures $28.0 million cash paid for equity investments and $6.1 million paid for a cost method investment. These increases were partially offset by $17.4 million of proceeds from the sales or maturities of investments and $98.6 million of cash proceeds from the sale of our TrueTouch\u00ae Mobile business, of the total cash proceeds received from the sale of our TrueTouch\u00ae mobile business, $10.0 million are held in an Escrow account until January 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nIn fiscal 2015, we generated $193.2 million of cash from our financing activities compared to $43.4 million in fiscal 2014. The cash we used in our financing activities in fiscal 2015 was primarily related our net borrowings on the revolving credit facility of $537.0 million, borrowings of $97.2 million on Term Loan A, net of costs, proceeds from settlement of capped calls which were assumed as part of the Merger of $25.3 million and net proceeds from the issuance of common shares under our employee stock plans of $52.3 million. The increases were offset by $315.0 million repayment of line of credit facility, $128.0 million of dividend payments, $55.1 million of repurchase of treasury stock and $9.6 million cash used for yield enhanced structured agreements settled in common stock.\nFiscal 2014:\nOperating Activities\nIn fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $103.3 million compared to $67.6 million in fiscal 2013. The increase in operating cash flows for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase in net income of $66.2 million compared to fiscal 2013. Our operating cash flow for 2014 of $103.3 million was primarily due to our net income of $16.5 million, net favorable non-cash adjustments to our net income including stock-based compensation of $50.2 million and depreciation and amortization of $46.7 million, and a net change in working capital of $15.7 million.\nInvesting Activities\nIn fiscal 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $42.2 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $0.3 million in fiscal 2013. The net cash used in our investing activities in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to investment purchases of $23.4 million, purchases of property and equipment of $20.9 million and investments made in other entities accounted for under the cost or equity method of accounting of $18.4 million, offset by the proceeds from sales of investments of $16.6 million.\nFinancing Activities\nIn fiscal 2014, net cash used in financing activities was $43.4 million compared to $45.0 million in fiscal 2013. The cash we used in our financing activities in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to payment of dividends of $69.2 million and the repayment of debt and obligations under capital leases of $6.3 million, offset by net proceeds of $32 million from the issuance of common shares under our employee stock plans.\nFiscal 2013:\nOperating Activities\nIn fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $67.6 million compared to $135 million in fiscal 2012. The decrease in operating cash flows for fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase in net loss of $24.8 million compared to fiscal 2012. Our operating cash flow for fiscal 2013 of $67.6 million was primarily due to our net loss of $50.1 million, offset by net favorable non-cash adjustments to our net loss including stock-based compensation of $73.0 million, depreciation and amortization of $48.4 million, and a net change in working capital of $20.1 million.\nInvesting Activities\nIn fiscal 2013, net cash provided by investing activities was $0.3 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $113.0 million in fiscal 2012. The cash provided by our investing activities in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to sales of investments of $64.4 million offset by investment purchases of $23.1 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $36.6 million primarily for our Emerging Technologies Division.\nFinancing Activities\nIn fiscal 2013, net cash used in financing activities was $45.0 million compared to $58.5 million in fiscal 2012. The cash we used in our financing activities in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to payment of dividends of $64.8 million, repayment on our long term revolving credit facility (Credit facility) of $145.0 million and repayment of other debt of $17.1 million, partially offset by net proceeds of $38.7 million from the issuance of common shares under our employee stock plans, and borrowings of $140.0 million on our Credit facility.\nLiquidity and Contractual obligations\nStock Repurchase Programs:\nOn October 20, 2015, our Board authorized a new $450 million stock buyback program. In connection with the approval of the new share repurchase plan, the share repurchase plan previously approved in September 2011 was terminated. The program allows us to purchase our common stock or enter into equity derivative transactions related to our common stock. The timing and actual amount expended with the new authorized funds will depend on a variety of factors including the market price of our common stock, regulatory, legal, and contractual requirements, alternatives uses of cash, availability of on shore cash and other market factors. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any particular amount of common stock and may be modified or suspended at any time at our discretion. From September 2011 through the termination of the program, we used $327.4 million from the program to repurchase 24.4 million shares at an average share price of $13.4. Under the new program authorized in October, 2015 through the end of fiscal 2015, we used $56.5 million to repurchase 5.7 million share at an average price of $10.0.\nAs of February 26, 2016, we repurchased a total of 29.3 million shares for a total cost of $237.8 million under the new program. As of February 26, 2016, the total dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the program is approximately $212.2 million.\nYield Enhancement Program ( YEP\u201d):\nAs discussed under Item 5 above and in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, we have periodically entered into short term yield enhanced structured agreements since fiscal 2009.\nIn fiscal 2014, we entered into short-term yield enhanced structured agreements with maturities ranging from 30 to 45 days at an aggregate price of $19.4 million. Upon settlement of these agreements, we received $19.7 million in cash. In fiscal 2013 we didn't enter into any short-term yield enhanced structured agreements.\nIn fiscal 2015, we entered into a short-term yield enhanced structured agreements with maturities ranging from 10 to 30 days at an aggregate price of $38.6 million. Upon settlement of these agreements, we received $29.4 million in cash and one million shares at an average price of $9.60.\nSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\nOn October 17, 2013, we amended our credit facility to reduce the revolving commitments to $300 million. In connection with the reduction, certain financial covenants were amended. The amended financial covenants include the following conditions: 1) maximum senior secured leverage ratio of 2.50 to 1.00 through January 1, 2017 and 2.25 to 1.00 thereafter, 2) maximum total leverage ratio of 4.25 to 1.00 through January 3, 2015, 3.5 to 1.00 through January 1, 2017 and 3.00 to 1.00 thereafter, 3) minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00, and 4) minimum liquidity of at least $100 million. Borrowings are collateralized by substantially all assets of the company.\nOn March 12, 2015, we amended and restated our existing senior secured revolving credit facility ( Credit Facility\u201d) and increased the size of the Credit Facility from $300 million to $450 million. The restated agreement also contains an option permitting us to arrange additional commitments of $250 million ( Incremental Availability\u201d) and specifies that the proceeds of these loans may be used for working capital, acquisitions, stock repurchases and general corporate purposes. The borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest, at the Company's option, at an adjusted base rate plus a spread of 1.25%, or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a spread of 2.25%. The borrowings under the Credit Facility are collateralized by substantially all of the Company's assets. The financial covenants were amended to include the following conditions: 1) maximum total leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 through January 1, 2017, and 3.00 to 1.00 thereafter, 2) minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00. At January 3, 2016, the Company's outstanding borrowings of $449.0 million were recorded as part of long-term liabilities and are presented as Long-term revolving credit facility and long term debt\u201d on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We incurred financing costs of $2.3 million to the new lenders of the Credit Facility which has been capitalized and recognized in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These costs will be amortized over the life of the Credit Facility.\nAs per the terms of the Credit Facility, we entered into a Joinder Agreement on December 22, 2015 under which we borrowed an additional $97.2 million ( Term Loan A\u201d), net of costs. Term Loan A is subject to, at the Company's option, either an interest rate equal to (i) 3.25% over LIBOR or (ii) an interest rate equal to 2.25% over the greater of (x) the prime lending rate published by the Wall Street Journal, (y) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (z) the LIBOR rate for a one month interest period plus 1%. The Company paid a 1.00% upfront fee in connection with the Term Loan A.\nThe Credit Facility, as amended, provides for a $450 million revolving credit facility and generally contains the same representations and warranties, covenants, and events of default that it contained prior to the effectiveness of the Amendment. The Amendment did not change the interest rate or maturity applicable to the Credit Facility and the Credit Facility remains guaranteed by certain present and future wholly-owned material domestic subsidiaries (the Guarantors\u201d) and secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets and the Guarantors.\nOn January 6, 2016, we entered into an Incremental Revolving Joinder Agreement to our Credit Facility to increase the amount of revolving commitments under our Credit Facility by an additional $90 million. The total aggregate amount of revolving commitments under the Credit Facility starting January 6, 2016 is $540 million.\nThe proceeds of the loans made under the Credit Facility may be used for working capital, acquisitions, stock repurchases and general corporate purposes. As of the filing date of this Form 10-K, $449.5 million aggregate principal amount of loans and letters of credit are outstanding under the Credit Facility and none of the Incremental Availability has been used.\nAs of January 3, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the Credit Facility.\nRefer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 for more information on our senior secured revolving credit facility.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of January 3, 2016:\n\n (1) Purchase obligations primarily include non-cancelable purchase orders for materials, services, manufacturing equipment, building improvements and supplies in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations are defined as enforceable agreements that are legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including quantity, price and timing. \n (2) Operating leases includes payments relating to Spansion's lease for office space in San Jose for a new headquarters entered on May 22, 2014, which is no longer required. The lease is for a period of 12 years, with two options to extend for periods of five years each after the initial lease term. The term of the lease commenced on January1, 2015 and expires on December 31, 2026. \n (3) On April 30, 2012, we entered into a patent license agreement whereby we paid a total patent license fee of $14.0 million in fiscal 2012 and committed to pay another $5.9 million on or before April 30, 2016 representing fees for future purchases of patents and patent related services. In June 2015, the Company paid an additional license fee of $18.5 million under the existing license agreement due to the merger with Spansion in March 2015. \nAs of January 3, 2016 our unrecognized tax benefits were $28.4 million, which were classified as long-term liabilities. We believe it is possible that we may recognize approximately $7 million of our existing unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months as a result of the lapse of statutes of limitations and the resolution of agreements with domestic and various foreign tax authorities.\nSale of Spansion's Sunnyvale property\nOn January 23, 2014, Spansion sold its property in Sunnyvale, California, consisting of 24.5 acres of land with approximately 471,000 square feet of buildings that included its headquarters building and submicron development center, a Pacific Gas & Electric transmission facility and a warehouse building, for net consideration of $59.0 million. Spansion concurrently leased back approximately 170,000 square feet of the headquarters building on a month-to-month basis with the option to continue the lease for up to 24 months; thereafter either party could terminate the lease. The first six months of the lease were rent free; thereafter the rents were lower than the market rates. For accounting purposes, these rents were deemed to have been netted against the sale proceeds and represent prepaid rent. As such, the use of the property after its sale constituted continuing involvement, and recognition of the sale of the property was deferred until the lease period ended. In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we terminated the lease on the Sunnyvale building and recognized an immaterial gain.\nEquity Investment Commitments\nAs disclosed in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have committed to purchase additional preferred stock from a company that operates in the area of advanced battery storage. During the fiscal year ended January 3, 2016, we purchased $28.0 million of preferred stock which was recorded as part of our investments in non-marketable securities. Subject to the attainment of certain milestones, we may purchase additional preferred stock of this company.\nCapital Resources and Financial Condition\nOur long-term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest-bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and debt securities, the purchase of our stock through our stock buyback program and payments of regularly scheduled cash dividends. In addition we may use excess cash to invest in our ETD, enter into strategic investments and partnerships and pursue acquisitions. As of January 3, 2016 in addition to $226.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, we had $0.9 million invested in short-term investments for a total cash and short-term investment position of $227.6 million that is available for use in current operations.\nAs of January 3, 2016, approximately 63.0% of our cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments are held outside of the United States. While these amounts are primarily invested in U.S. dollars, a portion is held in foreign currencies. All offshore balances are exposed to local political, banking, currency control and other risks. In addition, these amounts, if repatriated may be subject to tax and other transfer restrictions.\nWe believe that liquidity provided by existing cash, cash equivalents and investments and our borrowing arrangements will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, should prevailing economic conditions, debt covenants constraints, and/or financial, business and other factors beyond our control adversely affect our estimates of our future cash requirements, we could be required to fund our cash requirements by alternative financing. There can be no assurance that additional financing, if needed, would be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. We may also choose at any time to raise additional capital or debt to strengthen our financial position, facilitate growth, enter into strategic initiatives including the acquisition of other companies, repurchases of shares of stock or increase our dividends or pay a special dividend and provide us with additional flexibility to take advantage of other business opportunities that arise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Cypress uses non-GAAP measures to assess the following financial measures which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures:\n \u00b7 Revenue \n \u00b7 Gross margin \n \u00b7 Research and development expenses \n \u00b7 Selling, general and administrative expenses \n \u00b7 Operating income (loss) \n \u00b7 Net income (loss) \n \u00b7 Diluted net income (loss) per share \nThe non-GAAP measures set forth above exclude charges primarily related to Spansion merger costs and related amortization, which represented approximately 83% of total adjustments for the year ended January 3, 2016 as well as stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Cypress's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Cypress's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Cypress's business and operations. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision-making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to Cypress's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G and to make clear to our investors the adjustments we make to GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe believe that providing these Non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, are useful to investors because they allow investors to see our results through the eyes\u201d of management as these Non-GAAP financial measures reflect our internal measurement processes. Management believes that these Non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of our operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis and provides investors with another method for assessing our operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of our ongoing operations.\nCYPRESS SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(In thousands, except per-share data)\n(Unaudited)\n\n\n (1) Non-GAAP revenue includes for the three and twelve months ended January 3, 2016 includes $6.25 million and $17.5 million of Samsung intellectual property licensing revenue, not included in GAAP revenue as a result of the effect of purchase accounting for the Spansion Merger. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the data used to prepare them. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and we are required to make estimates, judgments and assumptions in the course of such preparation. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, inventory valuation, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and financial instruments, stock-based compensation, and settlement costs, and income taxes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies that are affected by significant estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are as follows:\nRevenue Recognition:\nWe generate revenues by selling products to distributors, various types of manufacturers including original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs\u201d) and electronic manufacturing service providers ( EMSs\u201d). We recognize revenue on sales to OEMs and EMSs provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, title has transferred, collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured, there are no customer acceptance requirements, and there are no remaining significant obligations.\nSales to certain distributors are made under agreements which provide the distributors with price protection, stock rotation and other allowances under certain circumstances. When we determine that the uncertainties associated with the rights given to these distributors, revenues and costs related to distributor sales are deferred until products are sold by the distributors to the end customers. In those circumstances, revenues are recognized upon receiving notification from the distributors that products have been sold to the end customers. In these cases, at the time of shipment to distributors, we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to receive payment, relieves inventory for the value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributors, and defers the related margin and price adjustment as deferred income on sales to distributors on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any effects of distributor price adjustments are recorded as a reduction to deferred income at the time the distributors sell the products to the end customers and the distributor submits a valid claim for the price adjustment.\nWe have historically recognized a significant portion of revenue through distributors at the time the distributor resold the product to its end customer (also referred to as the sell-through basis of revenue recognition) given the difficulty in estimating the ultimate price of these product shipments and amount of potential returns. We continuously reassesses our ability to reliably estimate the ultimate price of these products and, over the past several years, have made investments in our systems and process around our distribution channel to improve the quality of the information it receives from our distributors. Given these ongoing investments, and based on the financial framework for estimating potential price adjustments, beginning the fourth quarter of 2014, we concluded that we were able to reasonable estimate returns and pricing concessions on certain product families and with certain distributors, and we recognized revenue at the time it shipped these specific products to the identified distributors, less its estimate of future price adjustments and returns. As a result of this change, we recognized an incremental $12.3 million of revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. The impact of this change resulted in an increase of $6.2 million to net income attributable to Cypress for fiscal 2014, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share. During fiscal 2015, we recognized $40.9 million of incremental revenue from this change, which resulted in a decrease in net loss of $25.0 million or $0.07 per basic and diluted shares. During fiscal 2015, we recognized $780.8 million or 68% of distribution revenue on a sell-in basis.\nWe record as a reduction to revenues reserves for sales returns, price protection and allowances, based upon historical experience rates and for any specific known customer amounts. We also provide certain distributors and EMSs with volume-pricing discounts, such as rebates and incentives, which are recorded as a reduction to revenues at the time of sale. Historically these volume discounts have not been significant.\nOur revenue reporting is highly dependent on receiving pertinent, accurate and timely data from our distributors. Distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product, price, quantity, and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock. Because the data set is large and complex and because there may be errors in the reported data, we must use estimates and apply judgments to reconcile distributors' reported inventories to their activities. Actual results could vary materially from those estimates.\nBusiness Combinations:\nWe apply the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805\u201d), in the accounting for acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Accounting for business combinations requires the Company's management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates it has made have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts Receivable:\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers' inability to make required payments. We make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable by considering factors such as historical bad debt experience, specific customer creditworthiness, the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic trends that may affect a customer's ability to pay. If the data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our results of operations could be materially affected.\nValuation of Inventories:\nManagement periodically reviews the adequacy of our inventory reserves. We record a write-down for our inventories which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. We perform a detailed review of inventories each quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans and current sales levels. Inventory reserves are not relieved until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped. Our inventories may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and are sold in a highly competitive industry. If there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to record additional write-downs, and our gross margin could be adversely affected. In fiscal 2015, we recorded approximately $133 million of inventory reserves to write down inventory assumed as part of the merger.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets:\nOur business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities and equipment that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly under-utilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand. In addition, we have recorded intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions.\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our business, significant negative industry or economic trends, and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time. Impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value, and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analysis. If there is a significant adverse change in our business in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges on our long-lived assets.\nValuation of Goodwill:\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. We assess our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. In accordance with ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, qualitative factors can be assessed to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test for goodwill impairment. If we believe, as a result of our qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required.\nWe have four reporting units of which two, Memory Products division (MPD) and Programmable Systems Division (PSD), have goodwill. Determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are also unpredictable and inherently uncertain.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended January 3, 2016 were as follows:\n\n (1) Refer Note 2 for further details. \nOn the first day of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment using the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.\nWe estimated the fair values of our reporting units using a combination of the income and market approach. These valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, forecasted financial information, growth rates, terminal or residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.\nThe income approach utilizes estimates of discounted future cash flows. Key assumptions used in the market approach include the selection of appropriate benchmark companies and the selection of an appropriate market value multiple for each reporting unit based on a comparison of the reporting unit with the benchmark companies as of the impairment testing date.\nIn performing our 2015 assessment, we applied a weighting of 75% to the income approach and 25% to the market approach. Given that the reporting units are transitioning out of a period of declining revenue and profit, we believe the income approach is a better indication of the going concern value of the reporting units as it better captures the expected improvement in revenue and profit. As such, we placed more weighing on the income approach. Furthermore, as the market approach reflected general macroeconomic concerns that were evidenced in valuations for multiple publicly traded companies, the Company concluded this approach was not as relevant to the impairment calculation.\nBased on our goodwill impairment testing, we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill. The fair value of our MPD reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 53% and the fair value of our PSD reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 9%. As a result, if we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit, it would have resulted in the fair value of our PSD reporting unit being less than its carrying value. As an overall test of the reasonableness of estimated fair values of our two reporting units, we reconciled the combined fair value estimates of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of the valuation date. The reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were relatively representative of the market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization. However, any significant reductions in the actual amount of future cash flows realized by our reporting units, reductions in the value of market comparables, or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair values of our reporting units. Such events could ultimately result in a material charge to our results of operations in future periods due to the potential for a write-down of the goodwill associated with our reporting units.\nBased on our testing, we determined that there was a risk of our PSD reporting unit failing the first step of goodwill impairment test in future periods. For this reporting unit, the underlying assumptions we used in assessing fair value include, but are not limited to, declines in our stock price or our peers' stock prices, relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or small changes in other key assumptions, such as revenue growth rates and discount rates. Specifically, the income approach valuation for PSD included the following assumptions for 2015:\n\nOur PSD reporting unit is highly sensitive to management's plans for increasing sales and gross margins by expanding PSOC 3/4/5 and the Automotive business as well as the achievement of our cost reduction initiatives. If the actual revenue growth and profitability improvements forecasted for the PSD reporting unit do not achieve the levels we estimated in assessing the fair value of the PSD reporting unit, the fair value of the PSD reporting unit may decline. A future decline in the fair value of the PSD reporting unit may result in the recognition of an impairment charge to our earnings as a result of a write-down of the value of the goodwill associated with that reporting unit.\nOur next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed on the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. Such indicators include, but are not limited to, challenging economic conditions, such as a decline in our operating results, an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment, a substantial decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions. Such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a decrease in fair value and require us to record goodwill impairment charges.\nIn fiscal 2014, we elected to perform a qualitative analysis for impairment on goodwill rather than to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. We assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. After assessing many qualitative factors pertinent to our Company we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. In assessing the qualitative factors, we considered the impact of these key factors: 1) change in the industry and competitive environment, 2) market capitalization, 3) stock price and 4) overall financial performance. Based on the results of the testing, no goodwill impairment was recognized in fiscal 2014.\nIn fiscal 2013, we elected to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. Based on the results of the testing, no goodwill impairment was recognized in 2013.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments:\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Our financial assets and financial liabilities that require recognition under the guidance generally include available-for-sale investments, employee deferred compensation plan and foreign currency derivatives. The guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. As such, fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity-specific measure. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:\n \u00b7 Level 1 includes instruments for which quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Our financial assets utilizing Level 1 inputs include U.S. treasuries, money market funds, marketable equity securities and our employee deferred compensation plan assets with the exception of our stable value funds which are considered Level 2 instruments. \n \u00b7 Level 2 includes instruments for which the valuations are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets consist of certain marketable debt instruments for which values are determined using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Our Level 2 instruments include certain U.S. government securities, commercial paper, corporate notes and bonds, assets held-for-sale and our employee deferred compensation plan liabilities and our stable value funds included in our deferred compensation plan assets. \n \u00b7 Level 3 includes valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. Financial assets utilizing Level 3 inputs primarily include auction rate securities. We do not have any financial assets or liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs. \nCash Flow Hedges:\nThe Company enters into cash flow hedges to protect non-functional currency revenues, inventory purchases and certain other operational expenses against variability in cash flows due to foreign currency fluctuations. The Company's foreign currency forward contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges have maturities between three and nine months. All hedging relationships are formally documented, and the hedges are designed to offset changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions at the inception of the hedge. The Company recognizes derivative instruments from hedging activities as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures them at fair value on a monthly basis. The Company records changes in the intrinsic value of its cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. Interest charges or forward points\u201d on the forward contracts are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recorded in other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. When the forecasted transaction occurs, the Company reclassifies the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue or costs, depending on the risk hedged. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the Company will reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income (expense), net in its Consolidated Statements of Operations at that time.\nThe Company evaluates hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively and records any ineffective portion of the hedge in other income (expense), net in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer Note 11 for further details on cash flow and balance sheet hedges.\nStock-Based Compensation:\nUnder the fair value recognition provisions of the guidance, we recognize stock-based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the awards. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including measurement of level of achievement of performance milestones, the expected life of the share-based payment awards and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, our future stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded.\nEmployee Benefit Plans:\nIn connection with the Merger, we assumed the Spansion Innovates Group Cash Balance Plan (a defined benefit pension plan) in Japan. A defined benefit pension plan is accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions such as turnover rates, discount rates and other factors. The discount rate assumption is determined by comparing the projected benefit payments to the Japanese corporate bonds yield curve as of end of the most recently completed fiscal year. The benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation (PBO), which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement. This liability is recorded in other long term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net periodic pension cost is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and includes service cost. Service cost represents the actuarial present value of participant benefits earned in the current year. Interest cost represents the time value of money associated with the passage of time on the PBO. Gains or losses resulting from a change in the PBO if actual results differ from actuarial assumptions will be accumulated and amortized over the future life of the plan participants if they exceed 10% of the PBO, being the corridor amount. If the amount of a net gain or loss does not exceed the corridor amount, it will be recorded to other comprehensive income (loss). See Note 17 for further details of the pension plans.\nAccounting for Income Taxes:\nOur global operations involve manufacturing, research and development and selling activities. Profits from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country taxes but are not subject to U.S. tax until repatriated to the U.S. United States income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. Should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. This adjustment would increase income in the period such determination is made.\nThe calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment, a further charge to expense would result.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Recent Accounting
