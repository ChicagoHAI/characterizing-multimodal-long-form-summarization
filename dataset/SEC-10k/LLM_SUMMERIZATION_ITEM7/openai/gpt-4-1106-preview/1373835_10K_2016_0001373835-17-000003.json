Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nThroughout 2016, we continued to successfully execute the long-term strategies we outlined for our shareholders-meeting the needs of our customers, generating strong earnings and cash flows from our fee-based assets, executing capital expansion plans that underlie our growth objectives and maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. These results, combined with future growth opportunities, led our Board of Directors to approve an increase in our quarterly dividend effective with the first quarter of 2017 to $0.44 per share, which represents an increase in our annual dividend by $0.14 per share per year.\nDuring 2016, our earnings increased mainly due to expansion projects at Spectra Energy Partners and impairments in 2015 at Field Services, partially offset by pipeline inspection and repair costs related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania at Spectra Energy Partners and a lower Canadian dollar at Distribution and Western Canada Transmission & Processing.\nWe reported net income from controlling interests of $693 million and $1.00 of earnings per share for 2016 compared to net income from controlling interests of $196 million and $0.29 of earnings per share for 2015.\nEarnings highlights for 2016 compared to 2015 include the following:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Spectra Energy Partners' earnings benefited mainly from expansion projects, more than offset by pipeline inspection and repair costs related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Distribution's earnings remained flat mainly due to incremental earnings from the 2015 Dawn-Parkway expansion project and higher storage margins, offset by the effect of a lower Canadian dollar and warmer weather.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Western Canada Transmission & Processing's earnings decreased mainly due to lower firm gathering and processing revenues and the effect of a lower Canadian dollar, partially offset by lower plant turnaround costs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Field Services' earnings increased mainly due to the 2015 impairments of goodwill and other assets and an increase in gathering and processing margins, partially offset by expiration of hedges in 2016 and unfavorable results of initiatives to mitigate commodity price risk.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We invested $3.9 billion of capital and investment expenditures in 2016, including $3.3 billion of expansion and investment capital expenditures. Successful execution of our 2016 projects allowed us to continue to achieve aggregate returns over the past several years, consistent with our targeted return on capital employed range. Return on capital employed as it relates to expansion projects is calculated by us as incremental earnings before interest and taxes, generated by a project, divided by the total cost of the project. We continue to foresee significant expansion capital spending over the next several years, with approximately $4.6 billion planned for 2017, excluding contributions from noncontrolling interests. Concurrently, we executed on identified opportunities leveraging our asset footprint to capture incremental growth, connecting large diverse markets with growing supply throughout North America.\nWe are committed to an investment-grade balance sheet and continued prudent financial management of our capital structure. Therefore, financing growth activities will continue to be based on our strong and growing fee-based earnings and cash flows as well as the issuance of debt and equity securities. As of December 31, 2016, our revolving credit facilities included Spectra Energy Capital, LLC's (Spectra Capital's) two facilities totaling $3.0 billion, SEP's $2.5 billion facility, Westcoast's 400 million Canadian dollar facility, and Union Gas' 700 million Canadian dollar facility. These facilities are used principally as back-stops for commercial paper programs. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio was 56.4% and 59.8%, respectively.\nOn September 6, 2016, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Enbridge under which Enbridge and Spectra Energy will combine in a stock-for-stock merger transaction, which values Spectra Energy's stock at approximately $28 billion, based on the closing price of Enbridge's common shares as of September 2, 2016. This transaction was approved by the boards of directors and shareholders of both Spectra Energy and Enbridge and has received all necessary regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to close in February 27, 2017.\nOur Strategy. Our strategy is to create superior and sustainable value for our investors, customers, employees and communities by delivering natural gas, liquids and crude oil to premium markets. We will grow our business by way of organic growth, greenfield expansions and strategic acquisitions, with a steadfast focus on safety, reliability, customer responsiveness and profitability. We intend to accomplish this by:\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Building off the strength of our asset base.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maximizing that base through sector leading operations and service.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Effectively executing the projects we have secured.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Securing new growth opportunities that add value for our investors within each of our business segments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expanding our value chain participation into complementary infrastructure assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Natural gas supply dynamics continue to evolve, and there is general recognition that natural gas can be an effective solution for meeting the energy needs of North America and beyond. This causes us to be optimistic about future growth opportunities. Identified opportunities include growth in gas-fired power generation and industrial markets, LNG exports from North America, growth related to moving new sources of gas supplies to markets (including exports to Mexico) and significant new liquids pipeline infrastructure. With our advantage of providing continuous access from leading supply regions through to the last mile of pipe in growing markets, we expect to continue expanding our assets and operations to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\nCrude oil supply dynamics also continue to evolve as North American production moved from growth to decline. In recent years, growing North American crude oil production displaced imports from overseas and led to increased demand for crude oil transportation and logistics. Although depressed global crude oil prices resulted in declining North American oil production, we expect a return to attractive pricing and growing North American production outlook. Thus, we remain confident about long-term growth in North American oil production and our ability to capture future liquids and crude oil pipeline business.\nSuccessful execution of our strategy will depend on maintaining our reputation and leadership as a safe and reliable operator and the effective execution of our capital projects. Continued growth and new opportunities will be determined by key factors, such as the continued growth and production of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil within North America and our ability to provide creative solutions to meet the markets' evolving energy needs in both North America and beyond.\nWe continue to be actively engaged in the national discussions in both the U.S. and Canada regarding energy policy and have taken a lead role in shaping policy as it relates to pipeline safety and operations.\nSignificant Economic Factors For Our Business. Our regulated businesses are generally economically stable and are not significantly affected in the short-term by changing commodity prices. However, all of our businesses can be negatively affected in the long-term by sustained downturns in the economy or prolonged decreases in the demand for crude oil, natural gas and/or NGLs, all of which are beyond our control and could impair our ability to meet long-term goals.\nMost of our revenues are based on regulated tariff rates, which include the recovery of certain fuel costs. Lower overall economic output would reduce the volume of natural gas and NGLs transported and distributed or gathered and processed at our plants, and the volume of crude oil transported, resulting in lower earnings and cash flows. This decline would primarily affect distribution revenues and gathering and processing revenues, potentially in the short term. Transmission revenues could be affected by long-term economic declines resulting in the non-renewal of long-term contracts at the time of expiration. Pipeline transportation and storage customers continue to renew most contracts as they expire. Gathering and processing revenues and the earnings and cash distributions from our Field Services segment are also affected by volumes of natural gas made available to our systems, which are primarily driven by levels of natural gas drilling activity. While experiencing a decline in production from conventional gas wells, natural gas exploration and drilling activity in the areas that affect our Western Canada Transmission & Processing and Field Services segments remain stable, primarily driven by recent positive supply push\u201d developments around unconventional gas reserves production in numerous locations within North America as discussed further below and by demand pull\u201d projects in BC and the Pacific Northwest.\nOur combined key natural gas markets-the northeastern and the southeastern U.S., the Pacific Northwest, BC and Ontario-are projected to continue to exhibit higher than average annual growth in natural gas demand versus the North American and continental U.S. average growth rates through 2020. This demand growth is primarily driven by the natural gas-fired electricity generation sector, including regional Gulf Coast exports of LNG, exports to Mexico and a significant industrial and petrochemical expansion. The natural gas industry is currently experiencing a significant shift in the sources of supply, and this dramatic change is affecting our growth strategies. Traditionally, supply to our markets has come from the Gulf Coast region, both onshore and offshore, as well as from natural gas reserves in western and eastern Canada. The national supply\nprofile still includes significant production from traditional sources in the Rockies, Midcontinent, and the U.S. Gulf Coast and is augmented by significant resource growth in Appalachia and west Texas. Also, significant supply sources continue to be identified for development in western Canada. These supply shifts are shaping the growth strategies that we pursue, and therefore, will affect the nature of the projects anticipated in the capital and investment expenditure increases discussed below in Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Recent social and environmental activism and political pressures have arisen around the production processes associated with extracting natural gas from shale basins. Although we continue to believe that natural gas will remain a viable energy solution for the U.S. and Canada, these pressures could increase costs and/or cause uncertainty on timing of permitting and execution of new projects.\nOur key crude oil markets include the Rocky Mountain and Midwest states. Growth in our business is dependent on incremental crude oil supply from North American sources and the ability of that supply to displace imported crude oil from overseas. Lower crude oil prices over the past two years have adversely affected the availability and cost-competitiveness of North American crude oil supply. This has not adversely affected our crude oil pipeline business, but sustained low oil prices could have a negative impact on our current business and associated growth opportunities.\nIn certain areas of Western Canada Transmission & Processing's operations, lower natural gas prices resulting from increasing North American gas supply have reduced producer demand for expansions of the BC gas processing plants as well as renewals of existing gas processing contracts, and could continue to do so as long as gas prices remain below historical norms.\nDCP Midstream's business has commodity price exposure as a result of being compensated for certain services in the form of commodities rather than cash. For gathering and processing services and sales, DCP Midstream predominantly receives commodities as payment but may also receive fees, depending on the types of contracts. Over the past two years, commodity prices have declined substantially and have experienced significant volatility. Drilling activity levels vary by geographic area. As a result of lower commodity prices, some regions may see larger reductions in activity than others based on basin economics. Sustained low commodity prices could result in a decrease in exploration and development activities in the fields served by DCP Midstream's gas gathering, residue gas and NGL pipeline transportation systems, and DCP Midstream's natural gas treating and processing plants, which could lead to further reduced utilization of these assets.\nWhile the increase in natural gas supply has been largely positive for midstream companies, lower price dynamics and shifting preferences on producing basins may impact some of our business and pipelines in the long-term. The supply increase has had a negative impact on the seasonal price spreads historically seen between the summer and winter months. As a result, the value of storage assets and contracts has declined in recent years, however, significant increases in demand on the Gulf Coast, particularly for exports, should improve the value of our storage service in the future.\nOur businesses in the U.S. and Canada are subject to laws and regulations on the federal, state and provincial levels. Regulations applicable to the natural gas transmission, crude oil transportation and storage industries have a significant effect on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate. Changes to regulations are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that any future changes will have on our businesses.\nThese laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. Environmental laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties. In particular, compliance with major Clean Air Act regulatory programs may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures to obtain permits, evaluate off-site impacts of our operations, install emissions control equipment, and otherwise assure compliance.\nOur interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations administered by PHMSA of the DOT. These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines.\nPHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in a reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition or cash flows. Additionally, PHMSA issued an interim final rule, effective January 2017, that addresses safety issues related to underground natural gas storage facilities. We believe our existing storage facilities conform to the majority of the requirements of the new rule.\nIn light of the changing environmental and safety laws and regulations described above, we are evaluating efforts required to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations and, in addition, are assessing ways to improve overall system integrity, efficiency and reliability. The capital costs to effectively modernize our pipelines accordingly will be substantial and will be incurred over several years.\nAdditionally, investments and projects located in Canada expose us to risks related to Canadian laws, taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of the Canadian government. During the past several years, the Canadian dollar has fluctuated compared to the U.S. dollar, which affected earnings to varying degrees for brief periods. Changes in the exchange rate or any other factors are difficult to predict and may affect our future results.\nCertain of our segments' earnings are affected by fluctuations in commodity prices, especially the earnings of Field Services, which is most sensitive to changes in NGL prices. DCP Midstream manages its direct exposure to these market prices separate from Spectra Energy, and utilizes various risk management strategies, including the use of commodity derivatives.\nBased on current projections, our expected effective income tax rate will approximate 20%-21% for 2017. Our overall expected tax rate largely depends on the proportion of earnings in the U.S. to the earnings of our Canadian operations. Our earnings in the U.S. are subject to a combined federal and state statutory tax rate of approximately 37%. Our earnings in Canada are subject to a combined federal and provincial statutory tax rate of approximately 26%, but we anticipate an effective Canadian tax rate of less than 1% for 2017, driven primarily by the recognition of certain regulatory tax benefits. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further discussion about the tax impact of repatriating funds generated from our Canadian operations to Spectra Energy Corp (the U.S. parent).\nOur strategic objectives include a critical focus on capital expansion projects that will require access to capital markets. An inability to access capital at competitive rates could affect our ability to implement our strategy. Market disruptions or a downgrade in our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowings or affect our ability to access one or more sources of liquidity.\nDuring the past few years, capital expansion projects have been exposed to cost pressures associated with the availability of skilled labor, the pricing of materials and challenges associated with ensuring the protection of our environment and continual safety enhancements to our facilities. We have also experienced increased scrutiny placed on the permitting and construction of new projects from social and environmental activism; which can sometimes impact the timing of when construction activities, and the ultimate completion of a project, can occur relative to the expected timeline. We maintain a strong focus on project management activities to address these pressures as we move forward with planned expansion opportunities. Significant cost increases could negatively affect the returns ultimately earned on current and future expansions.\nFor further information related to management's assessment of our risk factors, see Part I.

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed at the parent-company levels, so the gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and interest and dividend income are excluded from the segments' EBITDA. We consider segment EBITDA to be a good indicator of each segment's operating performance from its operations, as it represents the results of our operations without regard to financing methods or capital structures. Our segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner.\nSpectra Energy Partners provides transmission, storage and gathering of natural gas for customers in various regions of the northeastern and southeastern U.S. and operates a crude oil pipeline system that connects Canadian and U.S. producers to refineries in the U.S. Rocky Mountain and Midwest regions.\nDistribution provides retail natural gas distribution services in Ontario, Canada, as well as natural gas transmission and storage services to other utilities and energy market participants.\nWestern Canada Transmission & Processing provides transmission of natural gas and natural gas gathering and processing services to customers in western Canada, the U.S. Pacific Northwest and the Maritime Provinces in Canada.\nField Services gathers, compresses, treats, processes, transports, stores and sells natural gas; produces, fractionates, transports, stores and sells NGLs; recovers and sells condensate; and trades and markets natural gas and NGLs. It conducts operations through DCP Midstream, which is owned 50% by us and 50% by Phillips 66.

The $97 million increase was primarily due to higher AFUDC resulting from higher capital spending and higher equity earnings from Sand Hills as a result of the continued ramp up and the expansion of the pipeline, as well as the fourth quarter 2014 U.S. Asset Dropdown of an additional 24.95% interest in SESH.\nMatters Affecting Future Spectra Energy Partners Results\nWe plan to grow our earnings through capital efficient projects, such as transportation and storage expansion to support a two-pronged supply push\u201d / market pull\u201d strategy, as well as continued focus on optimizing the performance of the existing operations through organizational efficiencies and cost control. Supply push\u201d is when producers agree to pay to transport\nspecified volumes of natural gas in order to support the construction of new pipelines or the expansion of existing pipelines. Market pull\u201d is taking gas away from established liquid supply points and building pipeline transportation capacity to satisfy end-user demand in new markets or demand growth in existing markets. Future earnings growth will be dependent on the success of our expansion plans in both the market and supply areas of the pipeline network, which includes, among other things, shale gas exploration and development areas, the ability to continue renewing service contracts and continued regulatory stability. Natural gas storage prices have recently been challenged as a result of increasing natural gas supply and narrower seasonal price spreads.\nGas supply and demand dynamics continue to change as a result of the development of non-conventional shale gas supplies. The increase in natural gas supply has resulted in declines in the price of natural gas in North America. As a result, a shift occurred to extraction of gas in richer, wet\u201d gas areas with higher NGL content which depressed activity in dry\u201d fields like the Fayetteville Shale formation where our Ozark assets are located. This, in turn, contributed to a resulting over-supply of pipeline take-away capacity in these areas. As the balance of supply and demand evolves, we expect activity in these areas to push prices higher. However, should supply and demand not come into balance, our businesses there may be subject to possible impairment. The supply increase has also had a negative impact on the seasonal price spreads historically seen between the summer and winter months. The value of storage assets and contracts has declined in recent years, negatively affecting the results of our storage facilities. While we expect storage values to stabilize and strengthen in the future, should these market factors continue to keep downward pressure on the seasonality spread and re-contracting, we could be subject to further reduced value and impairment of our storage assets.\nSpectra Energy Partners also plans to continue earnings growth by maximizing throughput on all sections of the pipeline systems. This entails connecting, where possible, to downstream pipelines, rail or barge terminals to extend the market reach of the pipeline to refinery-customers beyond the end of the pipeline. This also includes optimizing pipeline and storage operations and expanding terminal operations where appropriate.\nFuture earnings growth will be dependent on the success in renewing existing contracts or in securing new supply and market for all pipelines. This will require ongoing increases in supply of crude oil and continued access to attractive markets.\nOur businesses in the U.S. and Canada are subject to laws and regulations on the federal, state and provincial levels. Regulations applicable to the natural gas transmission, crude oil transportation and storage industries have a significant effect on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate. Changes to regulations are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that any future changes will have on our businesses.\nFERC's current policy permits pipelines and storage companies to include a tax allowance in the cost-of-service used as the basis for calculating their regulated rates. For pipelines and storage companies owned by partnerships or limited liability company interests, the current tax allowance policy reflects the actual or potential income tax liability on the FERC jurisdictional income attributable to all partnership or limited liability company interests if the ultimate owner of the interest has an actual or potential income tax liability on such income. On December 15, 2016, FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry requesting energy industry input on how the FERC should address income tax allowances in cost-based rates proposed by pipeline companies organized as part of a master limited partnership. This Notice of Inquiry was issued in response to a remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in United Airlines v. FERC, in which the court determined that FERC had not justified its conclusion that an oil pipeline organized as a partnership would not double recover\u201d its taxes under the current policy by both including a tax allowance in its cost-based rates and earning a return on equity calculated on a pre-tax basis. We cannot predict whether the FERC will successfully justify its conclusion that there is no double recovery of taxes under these circumstances or whether the FERC will modify its current policy on either income tax allowances or return on equity calculations for pipeline companies organized as part of a master limited partnership. However, any modification that reduces or eliminates an income tax allowance for pipeline companies organized as a part of a master limited partnership or decreases the return on equity for such pipelines could result in an adverse impact on our revenues associated with the transportation and storage services we provide pursuant to cost-based rates. We believe any changes would be prospective from the date of any FERC determination for our regulated entities. Some entities have authority to charge market-based rates and therefore this tax allowance issue does not affect the rates that they charge their customers.\nThese laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. Environmental laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties. In particular, compliance with major Clean Air Act regulatory programs may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures to obtain permits, evaluate offsite impacts of our operations, install pollution control equipment, and otherwise assure compliance.\nOur interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety regulations administered by PHMSA of the DOT. These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines.\nPHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in a reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition or cash flows. Additionally, PHMSA issued an interim final rule, effective January 2017, that addresses safety issues related to underground natural gas storage facilities. We believe our existing storage facilities conform to the majority of the requirements of the new rule.\nIn light of the changing environmental and safety laws and regulations described above, we are evaluating efforts required to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations and, in addition, are assessing ways to improve overall system integrity, efficiency and reliability. The capital costs to effectively modernize our pipelines accordingly will be substantial and will be incurred over several years.\nDistribution Table 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions, except where noted)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(157\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas purchased\n</td> <td>533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(158\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(188\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating, maintenance and other\n</td> <td>366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(79\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of customers, thousands\n</td> <td>1,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Heating degree days, Fahrenheit\n</td> <td>6,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(566\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(724\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipeline throughput, TBtu (a)\n</td> <td>762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canadian dollar exchange rate, average\n</td> <td>1.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Trillion British thermal units.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> 2016 Compared to 2015\nOperating Revenues.

This expansion will consist of a compressor station and associated facilities, and will lead to increased earnings. We expect that the long-term demand for natural gas in Ontario will remain relatively stable with continued growth in peak-day demand, subject to the impacts of future governmental actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some modest growth driven by low natural gas prices is expected to continue with specific interest coming from communities that are not currently serviced by natural gas, given the significant price advantage relative to their alternative energy options.\nNatural gas storage prices have recently been compressed as a result of increasing natural gas supply and narrower seasonal price spreads. Gas supply and demand dynamics continue to change as a result of the development of new unconventional shale gas supplies. These market factors will continue to affect Union Gas' unregulated storage and regulated transportation revenues in the near term. Going forward, Union Gas expects continued improvement in unregulated storage values.\nDuring the past several years, the Canadian dollar has fluctuated compared to the U.S. dollar, which affected earnings to varying degrees. Changes in the exchange rate or any other factors are difficult to predict and may affect future results.\nWestern Canada Transmission & Processing\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions, except where noted)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(265\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(617\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas and petroleum products purchased\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(125\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(273\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating, maintenance and other\n</td> <td>551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on sales of other assets and other, net\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(104\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(263\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipeline throughput, TBtu\n</td> <td>922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumes processed, TBtu\n</td> <td>636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canadian dollar exchange rate, average\n</td> <td>1.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared to 2015\nOperating Revenues.

Supply push\u201d growth projects are associated with gathering and processing expansions and incremental transportation capacity to support drilling activity in northern BC. Sizable growth in production is being driven by the application of new drilling technologies to unconventional gas reservoirs, with current growth heaviest in the southern and northern sections of the Montney play. Demand pull\u201d growth projects are associated with both small and large scale LNG exports as well as new natural gas-fired electricity generation, methanol, and fertilizer plants in BC and the Pacific Northwest. Prolific nearby gas supplies and favorable international market access have made gas focused projects in BC and the U.S. Pacific Northwest very attractive. Earnings can fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing of processing plant turnarounds that reduce revenues while a plant is out of service and increase operating costs as a result of the turnaround maintenance work. Western Canada Transmission & Processing's processing plants are generally scheduled for turnaround work every three to four years, with the work being staggered to prevent significant outages at any given time in a single geographic area. Future earnings will also be affected by the ability to renew service contracts and regulatory stability. Earnings from processing services will be affected by the ability to access additional natural gas reserves.\nDuring the past several years, the Canadian dollar has fluctuated compared to the U.S. dollar, which affected earnings to varying degrees for brief periods. Changes in the exchange rate are difficult to predict and may affect future results.\nIn certain areas of Western Canada Transmission & Processing's operations, lower natural gas prices resulting from increasing North American gas production have reduced producer demand for both expansions of the BC gas processing plants as well as renewals of existing gas processing contracts, and could continue to do so as long as gas prices remain below historical norms.\nField Services Table 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

the operating results of companies in the industry significantly affected by drilling activity, which may be impacted by prevailing commodity prices. DCP Midstream's business has commodity price exposure as a result of being compensated for certain services in the form of commodities rather than cash. Various factors impact both commodity prices and volumes. If commodity prices weaken for a sustained period, DCP Midstream's natural gas throughput and NGL volumes may be impacted, particularly as producers are curtailing or redirecting drilling, which could further reduce DCP Midstream's earnings and cash flows. Drilling activity levels vary by geographic area; DCP Midstream has observed decreases in drilling activity in certain regions, and increases in drilling activity in others.\nA decline in commodity prices has resulted in a decrease in exploration and development activities in certain fields served by DCP Midstream's gas gathering and residue gas and NGL pipeline transportation systems, and DCP Midstream's natural gas processing and treating plants, which could lead to further reduced utilization of these assets. DCP Midstream's long-term view is that commodity prices will be at levels that it believes will support growth in natural gas, condensate and NGL production. DCP Midstream believes that future commodity prices will be influenced by North American supply deliverability, the severity of winter and summer weather, the level of North American production and drilling activity by exploration and production companies and the balance of trade between imports and exports of LNG, NGLs and crude oil.\nNGL prices are impacted by the demand from petrochemical and refining industries and export facilities. The petrochemical industry has been making significant investment in building and expanding facilities to convert chemical plants from a heavier oil-based feedstock to lighter NGL-based feedstocks, including ethane. This increased demand in future years should provide support for the increasing supply of ethane. Prior to those facilities commencing operations ethane prices could remain weak with supply in excess of demand. In addition, export facilities are being expanded and built, which provide support for the increasing supply of NGLs. Although there can be, and has been, volatility in NGL prices, longer term DCP Midstream believes that there will be sufficient demand in NGLs to support increasing supply.\nOther Table 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating, maintenance and other\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(261\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>319\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on sales of other assets and other, net\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(126\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(384\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(58\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(326\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared to 2015\nEBITDA.

The $326 million change primarily reflects goodwill impairment charges associated with the Westcoast acquisition in 2002.\nMatters Affecting Future Other Results\nFuture results will continue to include operating costs related to corporate and business services we provide for our operations. We will also include the costs associated with the merger with Enbridge and self-insured losses associated with our captive insurance entities and the impact of stock prices changes on benefits expense.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe application of accounting policies and estimates is an important process that continues to evolve as our operations change and accounting guidance is issued. We have identified a number of critical accounting policies and estimates that require the use of significant estimates and judgments.\nWe base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at the time of application. These estimates and judgments may change as time passes and more information becomes available. If estimates are different than the actual amounts recorded, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to take into consideration the new information. We discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates and other significant accounting policies with our Audit Committee.\nRegulatory Accounting\nWe account for certain of our operations under accounting for regulated entities. As a result, we record assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under generally accepted accounting principles for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers or for instances where the regulator provides current rates that are intended to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future. We continually assess whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities. Based on this assessment, we believe our existing regulatory assets, which primarily relate to the future collection of deferred income tax costs for our Canadian regulated operations, are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state, provincial and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, regulatory asset write-offs would be required. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of regulatory assets. Total regulatory assets were $1,551\nmillion as of December 31, 2016 and $1,397 million as of December 31, 2015. Total regulatory liabilities were $434 million as of December 31, 2016 and $385 million as of December 31, 2015.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nWe had goodwill balances of $4,181 million at December 31, 2016 and $4,154 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in goodwill in 2016 was the result of foreign currency translation.\nAs permitted under accounting guidance on testing goodwill for impairment, we perform either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative assessment of each of our reporting units based on management's judgment. With respect to our qualitative assessments, we consider events and circumstances specific to us, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance, when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts.\nIn connection with our quantitative assessments, we primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair values of those reporting units. Key assumptions in the determination of fair value include the use of an appropriate discount rate and estimated future cash flows. In estimating cash flows, we incorporate expected long-term growth rates in key markets served by our operations, regulatory stability, the ability to renew contracts, commodity prices (where appropriate) and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as other factors that affect our reporting units' revenue, expense and capital expenditure projections.\nBased on the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing, no indicators of impairment were noted and the fair values of the reporting units that we assessed at April 1, 2016 (our annual testing date) were in excess of their respective carrying values.\nWe believe the assumptions used in our analyses are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the fair values of our reporting units. However, the assumptions used are subject to uncertainty, and declines in the future performance or cash flows of our reporting units, changing business conditions, further sustained declines in commodity prices or increases to our weighted average cost of capital assumptions may result in the recognition of impairment charges, which could be significant.\nNo triggering events have occurred with our reporting units since April 1, 2016 (our annual testing date) that would warrant re-testing for goodwill impairment.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues from the transmission, storage, processing, distribution and sales of natural gas, from the transportation and storage of crude oil, and from the sales of NGLs, are recognized when either the service is provided or the product is delivered. Revenues related to these services provided or products delivered but not yet billed are estimated each month. These estimates are generally based on contract data, regulatory information, estimated distribution usage based on historical data adjusted for heating degree days, commodity prices and preliminary throughput and allocation measurements. Final bills for the current month are billed and collected in the following month. Differences between actual and estimated revenues are immaterial.\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits\nThe calculations of pension and other post-retirement expense and liabilities require the use of numerous assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different reported expense and liability amounts, and future actual demographic and economic outcomes can differ from the assumptions. We believe that the most critical assumptions used in the accounting for pension and other post-retirement benefits are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the assumed discount rate, and the medical and prescription drug cost trend rate assumptions.\nFuture changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension and post-retirement plans will impact future pension expense and funding.\nThe expected return on plan assets is important, as certain of our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are partially funded. Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are developed by using a weighted average of expected returns for each asset class to which the plan assets are allocated. For 2016, the assumed average return was 7.50% for the U.S. pension plan assets, 7.15% for the Canadian pension plan assets and 6.33% for the U.S. other post-retirement benefit assets. A change in the rate of return of 25 basis points for these assets would impact annual benefit expense by approximately $1 million before tax for U.S. plans and by approximately $2 million before tax for Canadian plans. The Canadian other post-retirement benefit plans are not funded.\nSince pension and other post-retirement benefit cost and obligations are measured on a discounted basis, the discount\nrates used to determine the net periodic benefit cost and the benefit obligation are significant assumptions. Discount rates used for our defined benefit and other post-retirement benefit plans are based on the yields constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plans. Discount rates of 4.57% for the U.S. plans and 4.03% for the Canadian plans were used to calculate the 2016 net periodic benefit cost, and represent a weighted average of the applicable rates for all U.S. and Canadian plans, respectively. A 25 basis-point change in the discount rates would impact annual before-tax net periodic benefit cost by approximately $1 million for U.S. plans and $4 million for Canadian plans. Discount rates of 4.10% for the U.S. plans and 3.81% for the Canadian plans were used to calculate the 2016 year-end benefit obligations and represent a weighted average of the applicable rates for all U.S. and Canadian plans, respectively. The weighted average discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation decreased approximately 0.47% for the U.S. plans and approximately 0.22% for the Canadian plans during 2016. The decrease in the benefit obligation discount rate and actuarial experience during 2016 resulted in an increase in benefit obligations at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nSee Note 26 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on pension and other post-retirement benefits.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had negative working capital of $2,133 million. This balance includes commercial paper liabilities totaling $1,453 million and current maturities of long-term debt of $551 million. We will rely upon cash flows from operations and various financing transactions, which may include debt and/or equity issuances, to fund our liquidity and capital requirements for 2017. SEP is expected to be self-funding through its cash flows from operations, use of its revolving credit facility and its access to capital markets. We receive cash distributions from SEP in accordance with the partnership agreement, which considers our level of ownership and incentive distribution rights.\nWe have access to five revolving credit facilities, including Spectra Capital's two facilities totaling $3.0 billion, SEP's $2.5 billion facility, Westcoast's 400 million Canadian dollar facility and Union Gas' 700 million Canadian dollar facility, with available capacity of $1.9 billion under SEP's credit facility and $2.9 billion under our other subsidiaries' credit facilities. These facilities are used principally as back-stops for commercial paper programs. At Spectra Capital, SEP and Westcoast, we primarily use commercial paper for temporary funding of capital expenditures. At Union Gas, we primarily use commercial paper for temporary funding of capital expenditures and to support short-term working capital fluctuations. We also utilize commercial paper, other variable-rate debt and interest rate swaps to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable-rate debt. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of available credit facilities and Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity for a discussion of effective shelf registrations.\nOur consolidated capital structure includes commercial paper, long-term debt (including current maturities), preferred stock of subsidiaries and total equity. As of December 31, 2016, our capital structure was 56.4% debt, 25.8% common equity of controlling interests and 17.8% noncontrolling interests and preferred stock of subsidiaries.\nCash flows from operations for our 100%-owned and majority-owned businesses are stable given that approximately 90% of revenues are derived from fee-based services, of which most are regulated. However, total operating cash flows are subject to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, earnings sensitivities to weather, commodity prices, distributions from our equity investments and the timing of cost recoveries pursuant to regulatory approvals. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion.\nCash distributions from our equity investment, DCP Midstream, can fluctuate, mostly as a result of earnings sensitivities to commodity prices, as well as its level of capital expenditures and other investing activities. DCP Midstream funds its operations and investing activities mostly from its operating cash flows, third-party debt and equity transactions associated with DCP Partners. DCP Midstream is required to make quarterly tax distributions to us based on allocated taxable income. In addition to tax distributions, periodic distributions are determined by DCP Midstream's board of directors based on its earnings, operating cash flows and other factors, including capital expenditures and other investing activities, commodity prices outlook and the credit environment. We received no tax or periodic distributions from DCP Midstream during 2016 and 2015. We received total tax and periodic distributions from DCP midstream of $237 million in 2014. These distributions are classified within Cash Flows from Operating Activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We continue to assess the effect of sustained lower commodity prices and other activities at DCP Midstream on cash expected to be received from DCP Midstream and adjust our expansion or other activities as necessary.\nIn addition, cash flows from our Canadian operations are generally used to fund the ongoing Canadian businesses and future Canadian growth. At December 31, 2016, $164 million of Cash and Cash Equivalents was held by our Canadian subsidiaries. Historically, we have reinvested a substantial portion of our Canadian operations' earnings in Canada. Earnings not needed by our Canadian operations have been distributed to Spectra Energy Corp (the U.S. parent) with minimal incremental U.S. tax liability. We anticipate continued substantial reinvestment of our future Canadian earnings in Canada; however, future distributions to Spectra Energy Corp may incur incremental U.S. tax at the U.S. statutory rate without the ability to use foreign tax credits. The timing of when distributions may incur such incremental U.S. tax depends on many factors, such as the amount of future capital expansions in Canada, the tax characterization of our distributions as returns of capital or dividends, the impacts of tax planning on merger and acquisition activities and tax legislation at the time of the distributions.\nAs we execute on our strategic objectives around organic growth and expansion projects, expansion expenditures are expected to approximate $4.6 billion in 2017 and $2.0 billion in 2018, excluding contributions from noncontrolling interests. The timing and extent of these expenditures are likely to vary significantly from year to year, depending mostly on general economic conditions and market requirements. Given that we expect to continue to pursue expansion and earnings growth opportunities over the next several years and also given the scheduled maturities of our existing debt instruments, capital resources will continue to include long-term borrowings and possibly securing additional sources of capital including debt and/or equity securities. We remain committed to maintaining a capital structure and liquidity profile that continue to support an investment-grade credit rating.\nCash Flow Analysis\nThe following table summarizes the changes in cash flows for each of the periods presented:\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(3,830\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,782\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,003\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>1,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(199\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the period\n</td> <td>213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at end of the period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $221 million to $2,026 million in 2016 compared to 2015.

On March 1, 2016, we entered into an equity distribution agreement under which we may sell and issue common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $500 million. The equity distribution agreement allows us to offer and sell common stock at prices deemed appropriate through sales agents. Sales of common stock under the equity distribution agreement will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions through the facilities of the NYSE, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed upon by one or more of the sales agents and us. We intend to use the net proceeds from sales under this at-the-market program for general corporate purposes, including investments in subsidiaries to fund capital expenditures. We issued approximately 12.9 million of common shares to the public under this program, for total net proceeds of $383 million through December 31, 2016.\nIn April 2016, we issued 16.1 million common shares to the public for net proceeds of approximately $479 million. Net proceeds from the offering were used to purchase approximately 10.4 million common units in SEP. SEP used the proceeds from our unit purchase for general corporate purposes, including the funding of its current expansion capital plan.\nSEP Common Unit Issuances. In 2016, SEP issued 12.8 million common units to the public under its at-the-market program and approximately 262,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy. Total net proceeds to SEP were $591 million (net proceeds to Spectra Energy were $579 million). In April 2016, SEP issued 10.4 million common units and 0.2 million general partner units to Spectra Energy in a private placement transaction.\nIn connection with the issuances of the units, a $50 million gain ($31 million net of tax) to Additional Paid-in Capital and a $528 million increase in Equity-Noncontrolling Interests were recorded in 2016. The issuances decreased Spectra Energy's ownership in SEP from 78% to 75% at December 31, 2016.\nIn 2017, SEP has issued 0.5 million common units to the public and approximately 9,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy, for total net proceeds to SEP of $21 million (net proceeds to Spectra Energy were $21 million) through its at-the-market program.\nWestcoast Preferred Stock Issuance.

The terms of this new equity distribution agreement are substantially similar to those in SEP's previous agreements and allow SEP to sell and issue up to an aggregate offering price of $1 billion of common units. This at-the-market offering program allows SEP to offer and sell its common units, representing limited partner interests, at prices it deems appropriate through a sales agent. Sales of common units, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NYSE, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed to between SEP and the sales agent.\nSEP issued 12.0 million limited partner units to the public in 2015 under its at-the-market program and approximately 245,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy.

Proceeds from borrowings under the credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes. Amounts borrowed under the credit facility must be repaid following any change in control, including any that results from the proposed merger with Enbridge.\nOn April 29, 2016, we amended the Union Gas and SEP revolving credit agreements. The Union Gas revolving credit facility was increased to 700 million Canadian dollars and the SEP revolving facility was increased to $2.5 billion. The expiration of both facilities was extended, with both facilities expiring in 2021.\nOn April 29, 2016, we amended the Westcoast and Spectra Capital revolving credit agreements. The expiration of both credit facilities was extended, with both facilities expiring in 2021.\nThe issuances of commercial paper, letters of credit and revolving borrowings reduce the amounts available under the credit facilities. As of December 31, 2016, there were no letters of credit issued or revolving borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities.\nOur credit agreements contain various covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with those covenants. In addition, our credit agreements allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or in some cases, due to the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. Our debt and credit agreements do not contain provisions that trigger an acceleration of indebtedness based solely on the occurrence of a material adverse change in our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs noted above, the terms of our Spectra Capital credit agreements require our consolidated debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, as defined in the agreement, to be 65% or lower. Per the terms of the agreement, collateralized debt is excluded from the calculation of the ratio. This ratio was 56.3% at December 31, 2016. Our equity and, as a result, this ratio, is sensitive to significant movements of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar due to the significance of our Canadian operations as discussed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Risk.\u201d Based on the strength of our total capitalization as of December 31, 2016, however, it is not likely that a material adverse effect would occur as a result of a weakened Canadian dollar.\nDividends. Consistent with our near-term objective of increasing our cash dividend by $0.14 per year through 2018, we announced a $0.14 annual dividend increase on January 5, 2017. We expect to continue our policy of paying regular cash dividends. The declaration and payment of dividends are subject to the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the financial condition, earnings and capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per common share on January 5, 2017 payable on March 1, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2017.\nOther Financing Matters. Spectra Energy Corp, Spectra Capital and SEP have effective shelf registration statements on file with the SEC to register the issuance of unlimited amounts of various equity and debt securities. SEP also has $359 million available as of December 31, 2016 for the issuance of limited partner common units under another effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC related to its at-the-market program. Westcoast and Union Gas have an aggregate 1.2 billion Canadian dollars (approximately $893 million) available as of December 31, 2016 for the issuance of debt securities in the Canadian market under their medium term note shelf prospectuses, which expired on January 4, 2017.\nOn March 18, 2016, Westcoast filed a new 1 billion Canadian dollar short form base shelf prospectus, which provides for the issuance of first preferred shares. As of the date of this filing, Westcoast has 700 million Canadian dollars (approximately $521 million) available for the issuance of preferred shares under this prospectus, which expires on April 18, 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include financial guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. See Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of guarantee arrangements.\nMost of the guarantee arrangements that we enter into enhance the credit standings of certain subsidiaries, non-consolidated entities or less than 100%-owned entities, enabling them to conduct business. As such, these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility of us having to honor our contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of our subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events. Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of our operations.\nWe do not have material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures, except for normal operating lease arrangements, guarantee arrangements and financings entered into by DCP Midstream and our other equity investments. For additional information on these commitments, see Notes 21 and 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations\nWe enter into contracts that require payment of cash at certain periods based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices.

We have established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Our Chief Financial Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing credit risk and commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of NGLs and natural gas purchased as a result of our investment in DCP Midstream and processing associated with certain of our U.S. pipeline assets. Price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of these energy commodities. Our exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including contract size, length, market liquidity, location and unique or specific contract terms.\nDCP Midstream manages its direct exposure to market prices separate from Spectra Energy, and utilizes various risk management strategies, including the use of commodity derivatives.\nWe are exposed to market price fluctuations of NGLs, natural gas and oil in our Field Services segment. Based on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, a 10\u00a2 per-gallon change in NGL prices would affect our annual pre-tax earnings by approximately $25 million in 2017 and $40 million in 2016 for Field Services. For the same periods, a 50\u00a2 per-MMBtu change in natural gas prices would affect our annual pre-tax earnings by approximately $18 million in both periods, and a $10 per-barrel change in oil prices would affect our annual pre-tax earnings by approximately $20 million in both periods.\nThese hypothetical calculations consider estimated production levels, but do not consider other potential effects that might result from such changes in commodity prices. The actual effect of commodity price changes on our earnings could be significantly different than these estimates.\nSee also Notes 1 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. Our principal customers for natural gas transmission, storage, and gathering and processing services are industrial end-users, marketers, exploration and production companies, LDCs and utilities located throughout the U.S. and Canada. Customers on the Express-Platte system are primarily refineries located in the Rocky Mountain and Midwestern states of the U.S. Other customers include oil producers and marketing entities. We have concentrations of receivables from natural gas utilities and their affiliates, industrial customers and marketers throughout these regions, as well as retail distribution customers in Canada. These concentrations of customers may affect our overall credit risk in that risk factors can negatively affect the credit quality of the entire sector. Credit risk associated with gas distribution services are primarily affected by general economic conditions in the service territory.\nWhere exposed to credit risk, we analyze the customers' financial condition prior to entering into an agreement, establish credit limits and monitor the appropriateness of those limits on an ongoing basis. We also obtain parental guarantees, cash deposits or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support, where appropriate, based on our financial analysis of the customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each contract. A significant amount of our credit exposures for transmission, storage, and gathering and processing services are with customers who have an investment-grade rating (or the equivalent based on our evaluation) or are secured by collateral. However, we cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including possible declines in our customers' creditworthiness.\nBased on our policies for managing credit risk, our current exposures and our credit and other reserves, we do not anticipate a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non-performance by any counterparty.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. We manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable-rate exposures to percentages of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. We also enter into financial derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps and rate lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See also Notes 1, 17 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had interest rate hedges in place for various purposes. We are party to pay floating-receive fixed\u201d interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $2 billion to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt that arise as a result of changes in market interest rates. These swaps also allow us to transform a portion of the underlying interest payments related to our long-term fixed-rate debt securities into variable-rate interest payments in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable-rate debt.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2016, it was estimated that if short-term interest rates average 100 basis points higher (lower) in 2017 than in 2016, interest expense, net of offsetting interest income, would fluctuate by $39 million before tax. Comparatively, based on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2015, had short-term interest rates averaged 100 basis points higher (lower) in 2016 than in 2015, it was estimated that interest expense, net of offsetting interest income, would have fluctuated by approximately $35 million. These amounts were estimated by considering the effect of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate debt outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges, short term investments, and cash and cash equivalents outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur cost of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon, among other things, rates of return on plan assets. These plan assets expose us to price fluctuations in equity markets. In addition, our captive insurance companies maintain various investments to fund certain business risks and losses. Those investments may, from time to time, include investments in equity securities. Volatility of equity markets, particularly declines, will not only impact our cost of providing retirement and postretirement benefits, but will also impact the funding level requirements of those benefits.\nWe manage equity price risk by, among other things, diversifying our investments in equity investments, setting target allocations of investment types, periodically reviewing actual asset allocations and rebalancing allocations if warranted, and utilizing external investment advisors.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk from our Canadian operations. To mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, contracts may be denominated in or indexed to the U.S. dollar and/or local inflation rates, or investments may be naturally hedged through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency.\nTo monitor our currency exchange rate risks, we use sensitivity analysis, which measures the effect of devaluation of the Canadian dollar. An average 10% devaluation in the Canadian dollar exchange rate during 2016 would have resulted in an estimated net loss on the translation of local currency earnings of approximately $22 million on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, if a 10% devaluation had occurred on December 31, 2016, the Consolidated Balance Sheet would have been negatively impacted by $389 million through a cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI and this devaluation would result in an immaterial impact to our debt-to-total capitalization ratio. At December 31, 2016, one U.S. dollar translated into 1.34 Canadian dollars.\nAs discussed earlier, we maintain credit facilities that typically include financial covenants which limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of total capital for Spectra Energy or of a specific subsidiary. Failure to maintain these covenants could preclude us from issuing commercial paper or letters of credit or borrowing under our revolving credit facilities and could require other affiliates to immediately pay down any outstanding drawn amounts under other revolving credit agreements, which could adversely affect cash flows or restrict business. As a result of the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated equity, these fluctuations have a direct impact on our ability to maintain certain of these financial covenants.\nOTHER ISSUES\nFor information on other issues, see Notes 5 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nThroughout 2016, we continued to successfully execute the long-term strategies we outlined for our shareholders-meeting the needs of our customers, generating strong earnings and cash flows from our fee-based assets, executing capital expansion plans that underlie our growth objectives and maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. These results, combined with future growth opportunities, led our Board of Directors to approve an increase in our quarterly dividend effective with the first quarter of 2017 to $0.44 per share, which represents an increase in our annual dividend by $0.14 per share per year.\nDuring 2016, our earnings increased mainly due to expansion projects at Spectra Energy Partners and impairments in 2015 at Field Services, partially offset by pipeline inspection and repair costs related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania at Spectra Energy Partners and a lower Canadian dollar at Distribution and Western Canada Transmission & Processing.\nWe reported net income from controlling interests of $693 million and $1.00 of earnings per share for 2016 compared to net income from controlling interests of $196 million and $0.29 of earnings per share for 2015.\nEarnings highlights for 2016 compared to 2015 include the following:\n \u2022 Spectra Energy Partners' earnings benefited mainly from expansion projects, more than offset by pipeline inspection and repair costs related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania. \n \u2022 Distribution's earnings remained flat mainly due to incremental earnings from the 2015 Dawn-Parkway expansion project and higher storage margins, offset by the effect of a lower Canadian dollar and warmer weather. \n \u2022 Western Canada Transmission & Processing's earnings decreased mainly due to lower firm gathering and processing revenues and the effect of a lower Canadian dollar, partially offset by lower plant turnaround costs. \n \u2022 Field Services' earnings increased mainly due to the 2015 impairments of goodwill and other assets and an increase in gathering and processing margins, partially offset by expiration of hedges in 2016 and unfavorable results of initiatives to mitigate commodity price risk.  We invested $3.9 billion of capital and investment expenditures in 2016, including $3.3 billion of expansion and investment capital expenditures. Successful execution of our 2016 projects allowed us to continue to achieve aggregate returns over the past several years, consistent with our targeted return on capital employed range. Return on capital employed as it relates to expansion projects is calculated by us as incremental earnings before interest and taxes, generated by a project, divided by the total cost of the project. We continue to foresee significant expansion capital spending over the next several years, with approximately $4.6 billion planned for 2017, excluding contributions from noncontrolling interests. Concurrently, we executed on identified opportunities leveraging our asset footprint to capture incremental growth, connecting large diverse markets with growing supply throughout North America.\nWe are committed to an investment-grade balance sheet and continued prudent financial management of our capital structure. Therefore, financing growth activities will continue to be based on our strong and growing fee-based earnings and cash flows as well as the issuance of debt and equity securities. As of December 31, 2016, our revolving credit facilities included Spectra Energy Capital, LLC's (Spectra Capital's) two facilities totaling $3.0 billion, SEP's $2.5 billion facility, Westcoast's 400 million Canadian dollar facility, and Union Gas' 700 million Canadian dollar facility. These facilities are used principally as back-stops for commercial paper programs. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio was 56.4% and 59.8%, respectively.\nOn September 6, 2016, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Enbridge under which Enbridge and Spectra Energy will combine in a stock-for-stock merger transaction, which values Spectra Energy's stock at approximately $28 billion, based on the closing price of Enbridge's common shares as of September 2, 2016. This transaction was approved by the boards of directors and shareholders of both Spectra Energy and Enbridge and has received all necessary regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to close in February 27, 2017.\nOur Strategy. Our strategy is to create superior and sustainable value for our investors, customers, employees and communities by delivering natural gas, liquids and crude oil to premium markets. We will grow our business by way of organic growth, greenfield expansions and strategic acquisitions, with a steadfast focus on safety, reliability, customer responsiveness and profitability. We intend to accomplish this by:\n \u2022 Building off the strength of our asset base. \n \u2022 Maximizing that base through sector leading operations and service. \n \u2022 Effectively executing the projects we have secured. \n \u2022 Securing new growth opportunities that add value for our investors within each of our business segments. \n \u2022 Expanding our value chain participation into complementary infrastructure assets.  Natural gas supply dynamics continue to evolve, and there is general recognition that natural gas can be an effective solution for meeting the energy needs of North America and beyond. This causes us to be optimistic about future growth opportunities. Identified opportunities include growth in gas-fired power generation and industrial markets, LNG exports from North America, growth related to moving new sources of gas supplies to markets (including exports to Mexico) and significant new liquids pipeline infrastructure. With our advantage of providing continuous access from leading supply regions through to the last mile of pipe in growing markets, we expect to continue expanding our assets and operations to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\nCrude oil supply dynamics also continue to evolve as North American production moved from growth to decline. In recent years, growing North American crude oil production displaced imports from overseas and led to increased demand for crude oil transportation and logistics. Although depressed global crude oil prices resulted in declining North American oil production, we expect a return to attractive pricing and growing North American production outlook. Thus, we remain confident about long-term growth in North American oil production and our ability to capture future liquids and crude oil pipeline business.\nSuccessful execution of our strategy will depend on maintaining our reputation and leadership as a safe and reliable operator and the effective execution of our capital projects. Continued growth and new opportunities will be determined by key factors, such as the continued growth and production of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil within North America and our ability to provide creative solutions to meet the markets' evolving energy needs in both North America and beyond.\nWe continue to be actively engaged in the national discussions in both the U.S. and Canada regarding energy policy and have taken a lead role in shaping policy as it relates to pipeline safety and operations.\nSignificant Economic Factors For Our Business. Our regulated businesses are generally economically stable and are not significantly affected in the short-term by changing commodity prices. However, all of our businesses can be negatively affected in the long-term by sustained downturns in the economy or prolonged decreases in the demand for crude oil, natural gas and/or NGLs, all of which are beyond our control and could impair our ability to meet long-term goals.\nMost of our revenues are based on regulated tariff rates, which include the recovery of certain fuel costs. Lower overall economic output would reduce the volume of natural gas and NGLs transported and distributed or gathered and processed at our plants, and the volume of crude oil transported, resulting in lower earnings and cash flows. This decline would primarily affect distribution revenues and gathering and processing revenues, potentially in the short term. Transmission revenues could be affected by long-term economic declines resulting in the non-renewal of long-term contracts at the time of expiration. Pipeline transportation and storage customers continue to renew most contracts as they expire. Gathering and processing revenues and the earnings and cash distributions from our Field Services segment are also affected by volumes of natural gas made available to our systems, which are primarily driven by levels of natural gas drilling activity. While experiencing a decline in production from conventional gas wells, natural gas exploration and drilling activity in the areas that affect our Western Canada Transmission & Processing and Field Services segments remain stable, primarily driven by recent positive supply push\u201d developments around unconventional gas reserves production in numerous locations within North America as discussed further below and by demand pull\u201d projects in BC and the Pacific Northwest.\nOur combined key natural gas markets-the northeastern and the southeastern U.S., the Pacific Northwest, BC and Ontario-are projected to continue to exhibit higher than average annual growth in natural gas demand versus the North American and continental U.S. average growth rates through 2020. This demand growth is primarily driven by the natural gas-fired electricity generation sector, including regional Gulf Coast exports of LNG, exports to Mexico and a significant industrial and petrochemical expansion. The natural gas industry is currently experiencing a significant shift in the sources of supply, and this dramatic change is affecting our growth strategies. Traditionally, supply to our markets has come from the Gulf Coast region, both onshore and offshore, as well as from natural gas reserves in western and eastern Canada. The national supply\nprofile still includes significant production from traditional sources in the Rockies, Midcontinent, and the U.S. Gulf Coast and is augmented by significant resource growth in Appalachia and west Texas. Also, significant supply sources continue to be identified for development in western Canada. These supply shifts are shaping the growth strategies that we pursue, and therefore, will affect the nature of the projects anticipated in the capital and investment expenditure increases discussed below in Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Recent social and environmental activism and political pressures have arisen around the production processes associated with extracting natural gas from shale basins. Although we continue to believe that natural gas will remain a viable energy solution for the U.S. and Canada, these pressures could increase costs and/or cause uncertainty on timing of permitting and execution of new projects.\nOur key crude oil markets include the Rocky Mountain and Midwest states. Growth in our business is dependent on incremental crude oil supply from North American sources and the ability of that supply to displace imported crude oil from overseas. Lower crude oil prices over the past two years have adversely affected the availability and cost-competitiveness of North American crude oil supply. This has not adversely affected our crude oil pipeline business, but sustained low oil prices could have a negative impact on our current business and associated growth opportunities.\nIn certain areas of Western Canada Transmission & Processing's operations, lower natural gas prices resulting from increasing North American gas supply have reduced producer demand for expansions of the BC gas processing plants as well as renewals of existing gas processing contracts, and could continue to do so as long as gas prices remain below historical norms.\nDCP Midstream's business has commodity price exposure as a result of being compensated for certain services in the form of commodities rather than cash. For gathering and processing services and sales, DCP Midstream predominantly receives commodities as payment but may also receive fees, depending on the types of contracts. Over the past two years, commodity prices have declined substantially and have experienced significant volatility. Drilling activity levels vary by geographic area. As a result of lower commodity prices, some regions may see larger reductions in activity than others based on basin economics. Sustained low commodity prices could result in a decrease in exploration and development activities in the fields served by DCP Midstream's gas gathering, residue gas and NGL pipeline transportation systems, and DCP Midstream's natural gas treating and processing plants, which could lead to further reduced utilization of these assets.\nWhile the increase in natural gas supply has been largely positive for midstream companies, lower price dynamics and shifting preferences on producing basins may impact some of our business and pipelines in the long-term. The supply increase has had a negative impact on the seasonal price spreads historically seen between the summer and winter months. As a result, the value of storage assets and contracts has declined in recent years, however, significant increases in demand on the Gulf Coast, particularly for exports, should improve the value of our storage service in the future.\nOur businesses in the U.S. and Canada are subject to laws and regulations on the federal, state and provincial levels. Regulations applicable to the natural gas transmission, crude oil transportation and storage industries have a significant effect on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate. Changes to regulations are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that any future changes will have on our businesses.\nThese laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. Environmental laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties. In particular, compliance with major Clean Air Act regulatory programs may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures to obtain permits, evaluate off-site impacts of our operations, install emissions control equipment, and otherwise assure compliance.\nOur interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations administered by PHMSA of the DOT. These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines.\nPHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in a reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition or cash flows. Additionally, PHMSA issued an interim final rule, effective January 2017, that addresses safety issues related to underground natural gas storage facilities. We believe our existing storage facilities conform to the majority of the requirements of the new rule.\nIn light of the changing environmental and safety laws and regulations described above, we are evaluating efforts required to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations and, in addition, are assessing ways to improve overall system integrity, efficiency and reliability. The capital costs to effectively modernize our pipelines accordingly will be substantial and will be incurred over several years.\nAdditionally, investments and projects located in Canada expose us to risks related to Canadian laws, taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of the Canadian government. During the past several years, the Canadian dollar has fluctuated compared to the U.S. dollar, which affected earnings to varying degrees for brief periods. Changes in the exchange rate or any other factors are difficult to predict and may affect our future results.\nCertain of our segments' earnings are affected by fluctuations in commodity prices, especially the earnings of Field Services, which is most sensitive to changes in NGL prices. DCP Midstream manages its direct exposure to these market prices separate from Spectra Energy, and utilizes various risk management strategies, including the use of commodity derivatives.\nBased on current projections, our expected effective income tax rate will approximate 20%-21% for 2017. Our overall expected tax rate largely depends on the proportion of earnings in the U.S. to the earnings of our Canadian operations. Our earnings in the U.S. are subject to a combined federal and state statutory tax rate of approximately 37%. Our earnings in Canada are subject to a combined federal and provincial statutory tax rate of approximately 26%, but we anticipate an effective Canadian tax rate of less than 1% for 2017, driven primarily by the recognition of certain regulatory tax benefits. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further discussion about the tax impact of repatriating funds generated from our Canadian operations to Spectra Energy Corp (the U.S. parent).\nOur strategic objectives include a critical focus on capital expansion projects that will require access to capital markets. An inability to access capital at competitive rates could affect our ability to implement our strategy. Market disruptions or a downgrade in our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowings or affect our ability to access one or more sources of liquidity.\nDuring the past few years, capital expansion projects have been exposed to cost pressures associated with the availability of skilled labor, the pricing of materials and challenges associated with ensuring the protection of our environment and continual safety enhancements to our facilities. We have also experienced increased scrutiny placed on the permitting and construction of new projects from social and environmental activism; which can sometimes impact the timing of when construction activities, and the ultimate completion of a project, can occur relative to the expected timeline. We maintain a strong focus on project management activities to address these pressures as we move forward with planned expansion opportunities.

The $318 million decrease was driven by:\n \u2022 lower firm gathering and processing revenues, a decrease from the sale of Empress in August 2016 and lower NGL prices at Western Canada Transmission & Processing, \n \u2022 lower natural gas prices passed through to customers and lower usage due to warmer weather, partially offset by growth in the number of customers, incremental earnings from the 2015 Dawn-Parkway expansion project, higher rates due to increased demand side management (DSM) program charges and higher storage margins at Distribution and \n \u2022 the effects of a lower Canadian dollar at Distribution and Western Canada Transmission & Processing, partially offset by \n \u2022 higher revenues from expansion projects at Spectra Energy Partners.  Operating Expenses. The $474 million decrease was driven by:\n \u2022 lower plant turnaround costs, lower costs of NGL sales and a decrease from the sale of Empress in August 2016 at Western Canada Transmission & Processing, \n \u2022 lower natural gas prices passed through to customers and lower volumes of natural gas sold due to warmer weather, partially offset by growth in the number of customers and higher DSM program charges, net of lower employee related charges at Distribution, \n \u2022 the effects of a lower Canadian dollar at Distribution and Western Canada Transmission & Processing and \n \u2022 the 2015 goodwill impairment charges associated with the Westcoast acquisition in 2002 at Other, partially offset by \n \u2022 higher costs related to the merger with Enbridge and higher employee benefits costs at Other and \n \u2022 pipeline inspection and repair costs, higher costs related to expansion and property tax accruals due to the absence of a 2015 tax benefit at Spectra Energy Partners.  Gain (loss) on sales of other assets and other, net. The $30 million change was primarily the result of the sale of the Pesh natural gas processing facilities in the fourth quarter of 2016 at Western Canada Transmission & Processing.\nOther Income and Expenses. The $447 million change was primarily attributable to higher equity earnings from Field Services mainly due to the 2015 impairments of goodwill and other assets at DCP Midstream.\nInterest Expense. The $42 million decrease was mainly due to higher capitalized interest, the reversal of an interest accrual related to the release of tax reserves, and a lower Canadian dollar, partially offset by higher average long-term debt balances.\nIncome Tax Expense. The $55 million increase was primarily attributable to tax benefits associated with loss on investment due to impairments of goodwill and other assets at DCP Midstream in 2015, partially offset by the sale of Empress, tax rate changes and the release of tax reserves in 2016.\nThe effective tax rate was 17.5% in 2016 compared to 26% in 2015. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for reconciliations of our effective tax rates to the statutory tax rate.\nNet Income-Noncontrolling Interests. The $63 million increase was driven primarily by higher noncontrolling ownership interests at Spectra Energy Partners, partially offset by lower earnings at Spectra Energy Partners.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nOperating Revenues. The $669 million decrease was driven by:\n \u2022 the effects of a lower Canadian dollar at Distribution and Western Canada Transmission & Processing, \n \u2022 lower NGL prices, lower sales volumes of residual natural gas and non-cash mark-to-market gains and losses associated with the risk management program, net of an increase from settlement gains associated with the risk management program at Empress at Western Canada Transmission & Processing and \n \u2022 lower customer usage due to warmer weather, net of growth in the number of customers at Distribution, partially offset by \n \u2022 revenues from expansion projects primarily on Texas Eastern and East Tennessee at Spectra Energy Partners.  Operating Expenses. The $173 million decrease was driven by:\n \u2022 the effects of a lower Canadian dollar at Distribution and Western Canada Transmission & Processing, \n \u2022 decreased volumes of natural gas purchases for extraction and make-up and lower costs of sales at Western Canada Transmission & Processing and \n \u2022 lower volumes of natural gas sold due to warmer weather, net of growth in the number of customers at Distribution, partially offset by \n \u2022 goodwill impairment charges associated with the Westcoast acquisition in 2002 at Other.  Other Income and Expenses. The $596 million decrease was attributable to lower equity earnings from Field\nServices mainly due to decreased commodity prices and goodwill and other asset impairments.\nInterest Expense. The $43 million decrease was mainly due to a lower Canadian dollar and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by higher average long-term debt balances.\nIncome Tax Expense. The $221 million decrease was mainly due to tax benefits associated with loss on investment due to impairments of goodwill and other assets at DCP Midstream, lower earnings and the effect of a lower Canadian dollar.\nThe effective tax rate was 26% in 2015 compared to 23% in 2014. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for reconciliations of our effective tax rates to the statutory tax rate.\nNet Income-Noncontrolling Interests. The $63 million increase was driven by higher earnings from Spectra Energy Partners.\nFor a more detailed discussion of earnings drivers, see the segment discussions that follow.\nSegment Results\nManagement evaluates segment performance based on earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed at the parent-company levels, so the gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and interest and dividend income are excluded from the segments' EBITDA. We consider segment EBITDA to be a good indicator of each segment's operating performance from its operations, as it represents the results of our operations without regard to financing methods or capital structures. Our segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner.\nSpectra Energy Partners provides transmission, storage and gathering of natural gas for customers in various regions of the northeastern and southeastern U.S. and operates a crude oil pipeline system that connects Canadian and U.S. producers to refineries in the U.S. Rocky Mountain and Midwest regions.\nDistribution provides retail natural gas distribution services in Ontario, Canada, as well as natural gas transmission and storage services to other utilities and energy market participants.\nWestern Canada Transmission & Processing provides transmission of natural gas and natural gas gathering and processing services to customers in western Canada, the U.S. Pacific Northwest and the Maritime Provinces in Canada.\nField Services gathers, compresses, treats, processes, transports, stores and sells natural gas; produces, fractionates, transports, stores and sells NGLs; recovers and sells condensate; and trades and markets natural gas and NGLs. It conducts operations through DCP Midstream, which is owned 50% by us and 50% by Phillips 66. DCP Midstream operates in a diverse number of regions, including the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Niobrara/DJ Basin and the Midcontinent. As of December 31, 2016, DCP Midstream had an approximate 21% ownership interest in DCP Partners, a publicly-traded master limited partnership.\nSegment EBITDA is summarized in the following table.

The $78 million increase was driven by:\n \u2022 a $113 million increase due to expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern and Algonquin, \n \u2022 a $7 million increase in storage revenues due to new contracts at higher rates and \n \u2022 a $7 million increase in crude oil transportation revenues due to the Express Enhancement expansion project placed into service in October 2016, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $16 million decrease in recoveries of electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers, \n \u2022 a $15 million decrease in processing revenues primarily due to lower volumes, \n \u2022 a $10 million decrease in crude oil transportation revenues, as a result of lower volumes primarily on the Platte pipeline, substantially offset by increased tariff rates mainly on the Express pipeline and \n \u2022 a $9 million decrease in natural gas transportation revenues mainly from interruptible transportation on Texas Eastern and M&N U.S. and short-term firm transportation on Algonquin. \nOperating, Maintenance and Other. The $89 million increase was driven by:\n \u2022 an $80 million increase due to pipeline inspection and repair costs related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania, \n \u2022 a $47 million increase in costs related to expansion and \n \u2022 an $11 million increase in property tax accruals due to the absence of a 2015 tax benefit, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $16 million decrease in electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers, \n \u2022 an $11 million decrease in power costs due to lower usage in 2016 and maintenance costs on the Express and Platte pipelines, \n \u2022 a $9 million decrease due to a prior year non-cash impairment charge on Ozark Gas Gathering, \n \u2022 an $8 million decrease in operating costs and \n \u2022 a $4 million decrease in project development costs.  Other Income and Expenses. The $15 million increase was mainly due to higher allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) resulting from higher capital spending on expansion projects, partially offset by the absence of equity earnings from Sand Hills and Southern Hills owned until October 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nOperating Revenues. The $186 million increase was driven by:\n \u2022 a $137 million increase due to expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern and East Tennessee, \n \u2022 a $54 million increase in crude oil transportation revenues as a result of increased tariff rates mainly on the Express pipeline and higher volumes on the Express and Platte pipelines and \n \u2022 a $43 million increase in recoveries of electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $22 million decrease in processing revenues primarily due to lower prices, net of higher volumes, \n \u2022 an $18 million decrease in inventory settlement revenues due primarily to sales of excess tank oil in 2014 and lower crude oil prices on the Express and Platte pipelines, \n \u2022 an $8 million decrease in natural gas transportation revenues mainly from short-term firm and interruptible transportation on Texas Eastern and other revenue on East Tennessee, net of higher firm transportation on Algonquin and \n \u2022 a $6 million decrease in storage revenues due to lower rates.  Operating, Maintenance and Other. The $47 million increase was driven by:\n \u2022 a $43 million increase in electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers, \n \u2022 a $9 million increase due to the non-cash impairment charge on Ozark Gas Gathering and \n \u2022 an $8 million increase in operating costs, net of employee benefit costs, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $21 million decrease due to lower ad valorem tax accruals and \n \u2022 a $5 million decrease from project development costs expensed in 2014.  Other Income and Expenses. The $97 million increase was primarily due to higher AFUDC resulting from higher capital spending and higher equity earnings from Sand Hills as a result of the continued ramp up and the expansion of the pipeline, as well as the fourth quarter 2014 U.S. Asset Dropdown of an additional 24.95% interest in SESH.\nMatters Affecting Future Spectra Energy Partners Results\nWe plan to grow our earnings through capital efficient projects, such as transportation and storage expansion to support a two-pronged supply push\u201d / market pull\u201d strategy, as well as continued focus on optimizing the performance of the existing operations through organizational efficiencies and cost control. Supply push\u201d is when producers agree to pay to transport\nspecified volumes of natural gas in order to support the construction of new pipelines or the expansion of existing pipelines. Market pull\u201d is taking gas away from established liquid supply points and building pipeline transportation capacity to satisfy end-user demand in new markets or demand growth in existing markets. Future earnings growth will be dependent on the success of our expansion plans in both the market and supply areas of the pipeline network, which includes, among other things, shale gas exploration and development areas, the ability to continue renewing service contracts and continued regulatory stability. Natural gas storage prices have recently been challenged as a result of increasing natural gas supply and narrower seasonal price spreads.\nGas supply and demand dynamics continue to change as a result of the development of non-conventional shale gas supplies. The increase in natural gas supply has resulted in declines in the price of natural gas in North America. As a result, a shift occurred to extraction of gas in richer, wet\u201d gas areas with higher NGL content which depressed activity in dry\u201d fields like the Fayetteville Shale formation where our Ozark assets are located. This, in turn, contributed to a resulting over-supply of pipeline take-away capacity in these areas. As the balance of supply and demand evolves, we expect activity in these areas to push prices higher. However, should supply and demand not come into balance, our businesses there may be subject to possible impairment. The supply increase has also had a negative impact on the seasonal price spreads historically seen between the summer and winter months. The value of storage assets and contracts has declined in recent years, negatively affecting the results of our storage facilities. While we expect storage values to stabilize and strengthen in the future, should these market factors continue to keep downward pressure on the seasonality spread and re-contracting, we could be subject to further reduced value and impairment of our storage assets.\nSpectra Energy Partners also plans to continue earnings growth by maximizing throughput on all sections of the pipeline systems. This entails connecting, where possible, to downstream pipelines, rail or barge terminals to extend the market reach of the pipeline to refinery-customers beyond the end of the pipeline. This also includes optimizing pipeline and storage operations and expanding terminal operations where appropriate.\nFuture earnings growth will be dependent on the success in renewing existing contracts or in securing new supply and market for all pipelines. This will require ongoing increases in supply of crude oil and continued access to attractive markets.\nOur businesses in the U.S. and Canada are subject to laws and regulations on the federal, state and provincial levels. Regulations applicable to the natural gas transmission, crude oil transportation and storage industries have a significant effect on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate. Changes to regulations are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that any future changes will have on our businesses.\nFERC's current policy permits pipelines and storage companies to include a tax allowance in the cost-of-service used as the basis for calculating their regulated rates. For pipelines and storage companies owned by partnerships or limited liability company interests, the current tax allowance policy reflects the actual or potential income tax liability on the FERC jurisdictional income attributable to all partnership or limited liability company interests if the ultimate owner of the interest has an actual or potential income tax liability on such income. On December 15, 2016, FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry requesting energy industry input on how the FERC should address income tax allowances in cost-based rates proposed by pipeline companies organized as part of a master limited partnership. This Notice of Inquiry was issued in response to a remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in United Airlines v. FERC, in which the court determined that FERC had not justified its conclusion that an oil pipeline organized as a partnership would not double recover\u201d its taxes under the current policy by both including a tax allowance in its cost-based rates and earning a return on equity calculated on a pre-tax basis. We cannot predict whether the FERC will successfully justify its conclusion that there is no double recovery of taxes under these circumstances or whether the FERC will modify its current policy on either income tax allowances or return on equity calculations for pipeline companies organized as part of a master limited partnership. However, any modification that reduces or eliminates an income tax allowance for pipeline companies organized as a part of a master limited partnership or decreases the return on equity for such pipelines could result in an adverse impact on our revenues associated with the transportation and storage services we provide pursuant to cost-based rates. We believe any changes would be prospective from the date of any FERC determination for our regulated entities. Some entities have authority to charge market-based rates and therefore this tax allowance issue does not affect the rates that they charge their customers.\nThese laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. Environmental laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties. In particular, compliance with major Clean Air Act regulatory programs may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures to obtain permits, evaluate offsite impacts of our operations, install pollution control equipment, and otherwise assure compliance.\nOur interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety regulations administered by PHMSA of the DOT. These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines.\nPHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in a reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition or cash flows. Additionally, PHMSA issued an interim final rule, effective January 2017, that addresses safety issues related to underground natural gas storage facilities. We believe our existing storage facilities conform to the majority of the requirements of the new rule.\nIn light of the changing environmental and safety laws and regulations described above, we are evaluating efforts required to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations and, in addition, are assessing ways to improve overall system integrity, efficiency and reliability. The capital costs to effectively modernize our pipelines accordingly will be substantial and will be incurred over several years.\nDistribution Table 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions, except where noted)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(157\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas purchased\n</td> <td>533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(158\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(188\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating, maintenance and other\n</td> <td>366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(79\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of customers, thousands\n</td> <td>1,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Heating degree days, Fahrenheit\n</td> <td>6,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(566\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(724\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipeline throughput, TBtu (a)\n</td> <td>762\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canadian dollar exchange rate, average\n</td> <td>1.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\n (a) Trillion British thermal units.  2016 Compared to 2015\nOperating Revenues.

This expansion will consist of a compressor station and associated facilities, and will lead to increased earnings. We expect that the long-term demand for natural gas in Ontario will remain relatively stable with continued growth in peak-day demand, subject to the impacts of future governmental actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some modest growth driven by low natural gas prices is expected to continue with specific interest coming from communities that are not currently serviced by natural gas, given the significant price advantage relative to their alternative energy options.\nNatural gas storage prices have recently been compressed as a result of increasing natural gas supply and narrower seasonal price spreads. Gas supply and demand dynamics continue to change as a result of the development of new unconventional shale gas supplies. These market factors will continue to affect Union Gas' unregulated storage and regulated transportation revenues in the near term. Going forward, Union Gas expects continued improvement in unregulated storage values.\nDuring the past several years, the Canadian dollar has fluctuated compared to the U.S. dollar, which affected earnings to varying degrees. Changes in the exchange rate or any other factors are difficult to predict and may affect future results.\nWestern Canada Transmission & Processing\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions, except where noted)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(265\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(617\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas and petroleum products purchased\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(125\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(273\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating, maintenance and other\n</td> <td>551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on sales of other assets and other, net\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(104\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(263\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pipeline throughput, TBtu\n</td> <td>922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumes processed, TBtu\n</td> <td>636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canadian dollar exchange rate, average\n</td> <td>1.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared to 2015\nOperating Revenues.

Matters Affecting Future Western Canada Transmission & Processing Results\nWestern Canada Transmission & Processing plans to continue earnings growth through capital efficient supply push\u201d and demand pull\u201d initiatives. Supply push\u201d growth projects are associated with gathering and processing expansions and incremental transportation capacity to support drilling activity in northern BC. Sizable growth in production is being driven by the application of new drilling technologies to unconventional gas reservoirs, with current growth heaviest in the southern and northern sections of the Montney play. Demand pull\u201d growth projects are associated with both small and large scale LNG exports as well as new natural gas-fired electricity generation, methanol, and fertilizer plants in BC and the Pacific Northwest. Prolific nearby gas supplies and favorable international market access have made gas focused projects in BC and the U.S. Pacific Northwest very attractive. Earnings can fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing of processing plant turnarounds that reduce revenues while a plant is out of service and increase operating costs as a result of the turnaround maintenance work. Western Canada Transmission & Processing's processing plants are generally scheduled for turnaround work every three to four years, with the work being staggered to prevent significant outages at any given time in a single geographic area. Future earnings will also be affected by the ability to renew service contracts and regulatory stability. Earnings from processing services will be affected by the ability to access additional natural gas reserves.\nDuring the past several years, the Canadian dollar has fluctuated compared to the U.S. dollar, which affected earnings to varying degrees for brief periods. Changes in the exchange rate are difficult to predict and may affect future results.\nIn certain areas of Western Canada Transmission & Processing's operations, lower natural gas prices resulting from increasing North American gas production have reduced producer demand for both expansions of the BC gas processing plants as well as renewals of existing gas processing contracts, and could continue to do so as long as gas prices remain below historical norms.\nField Services Table 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

DCP Midstream's business has commodity price exposure as a result of being compensated for certain services in the form of commodities rather than cash. Various factors impact both commodity prices and volumes. If commodity prices weaken for a sustained period, DCP Midstream's natural gas throughput and NGL volumes may be impacted, particularly as producers are curtailing or redirecting drilling, which could further reduce DCP Midstream's earnings and cash flows. Drilling activity levels vary by geographic area; DCP Midstream has observed decreases in drilling activity in certain regions, and increases in drilling activity in others.\nA decline in commodity prices has resulted in a decrease in exploration and development activities in certain fields served by DCP Midstream's gas gathering and residue gas and NGL pipeline transportation systems, and DCP Midstream's natural gas processing and treating plants, which could lead to further reduced utilization of these assets. DCP Midstream's long-term view is that commodity prices will be at levels that it believes will support growth in natural gas, condensate and NGL production. DCP Midstream believes that future commodity prices will be influenced by North American supply deliverability, the severity of winter and summer weather, the level of North American production and drilling activity by exploration and production companies and the balance of trade between imports and exports of LNG, NGLs and crude oil.\nNGL prices are impacted by the demand from petrochemical and refining industries and export facilities. The petrochemical industry has been making significant investment in building and expanding facilities to convert chemical plants from a heavier oil-based feedstock to lighter NGL-based feedstocks, including ethane. This increased demand in future years should provide support for the increasing supply of ethane. Prior to those facilities commencing operations ethane prices could remain weak with supply in excess of demand. In addition, export facilities are being expanded and built, which provide support for the increasing supply of NGLs. Although there can be, and has been, volatility in NGL prices, longer term DCP Midstream believes that there will be sufficient demand in NGLs to support increasing supply.\nOther Table 195: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating, maintenance and other\n</td> <td>200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(261\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>319\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on sales of other assets and other, net\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income and expenses\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(126\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(384\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(58\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(326\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared to 2015\nEBITDA. The $258 million change was driven by:\n \u2022 $333 million due to the 2015 goodwill impairment charges associated with the Westcoast acquisition in 2002, partially offset by \n \u2022 $38 million due to higher costs primarily related to the merger with Enbridge announced on September 6, 2016, \n \u2022 $25 million due to higher employee benefit costs and \n \u2022 $10 million due to a captive insurance general liability reserve related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania.  2015 Compared to 2014\nEBITDA. The $326 million change primarily reflects goodwill impairment charges associated with the Westcoast acquisition in 2002.\nMatters Affecting Future Other Results\nFuture results will continue to include operating costs related to corporate and business services we provide for our operations. We will also include the costs associated with the merger with Enbridge and self-insured losses associated with our captive insurance entities and the impact of stock prices changes on benefits expense.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe application of accounting policies and estimates is an important process that continues to evolve as our operations change and accounting guidance is issued. We have identified a number of critical accounting policies and estimates that require the use of significant estimates and judgments.\nWe base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at the time of application. These estimates and judgments may change as time passes and more information becomes available. If estimates are different than the actual amounts recorded, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to take into consideration the new information. We discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates and other significant accounting policies with our Audit Committee.\nRegulatory Accounting\nWe account for certain of our operations under accounting for regulated entities. As a result, we record assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under generally accepted accounting principles for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers or for instances where the regulator provides current rates that are intended to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future. We continually assess whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities. Based on this assessment, we believe our existing regulatory assets, which primarily relate to the future collection of deferred income tax costs for our Canadian regulated operations, are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state, provincial and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, regulatory asset write-offs would be required. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of regulatory assets. Total regulatory assets were $1,551\nmillion as of December 31, 2016 and $1,397 million as of December 31, 2015. Total regulatory liabilities were $434 million as of December 31, 2016 and $385 million as of December 31, 2015.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nWe had goodwill balances of $4,181 million at December 31, 2016 and $4,154 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in goodwill in 2016 was the result of foreign currency translation.\nAs permitted under accounting guidance on testing goodwill for impairment, we perform either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative assessment of each of our reporting units based on management's judgment. With respect to our qualitative assessments, we consider events and circumstances specific to us, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance, when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts.\nIn connection with our quantitative assessments, we primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair values of those reporting units. Key assumptions in the determination of fair value include the use of an appropriate discount rate and estimated future cash flows. In estimating cash flows, we incorporate expected long-term growth rates in key markets served by our operations, regulatory stability, the ability to renew contracts, commodity prices (where appropriate) and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as other factors that affect our reporting units' revenue, expense and capital expenditure projections.\nBased on the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing, no indicators of impairment were noted and the fair values of the reporting units that we assessed at April 1, 2016 (our annual testing date) were in excess of their respective carrying values.\nWe believe the assumptions used in our analyses are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the fair values of our reporting units. However, the assumptions used are subject to uncertainty, and declines in the future performance or cash flows of our reporting units, changing business conditions, further sustained declines in commodity prices or increases to our weighted average cost of capital assumptions may result in the recognition of impairment charges, which could be significant.\nNo triggering events have occurred with our reporting units since April 1, 2016 (our annual testing date) that would warrant re-testing for goodwill impairment.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues from the transmission, storage, processing, distribution and sales of natural gas, from the transportation and storage of crude oil, and from the sales of NGLs, are recognized when either the service is provided or the product is delivered. Revenues related to these services provided or products delivered but not yet billed are estimated each month. These estimates are generally based on contract data, regulatory information, estimated distribution usage based on historical data adjusted for heating degree days, commodity prices and preliminary throughput and allocation measurements. Final bills for the current month are billed and collected in the following month. Differences between actual and estimated revenues are immaterial.\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits\nThe calculations of pension and other post-retirement expense and liabilities require the use of numerous assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different reported expense and liability amounts, and future actual demographic and economic outcomes can differ from the assumptions. We believe that the most critical assumptions used in the accounting for pension and other post-retirement benefits are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the assumed discount rate, and the medical and prescription drug cost trend rate assumptions.\nFuture changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension and post-retirement plans will impact future pension expense and funding.\nThe expected return on plan assets is important, as certain of our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are partially funded. Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are developed by using a weighted average of expected returns for each asset class to which the plan assets are allocated. For 2016, the assumed average return was 7.50% for the U.S. pension plan assets, 7.15% for the Canadian pension plan assets and 6.33% for the U.S. other post-retirement benefit assets. A change in the rate of return of 25 basis points for these assets would impact annual benefit expense by approximately $1 million before tax for U.S. plans and by approximately $2 million before tax for Canadian plans. The Canadian other post-retirement benefit plans are not funded.\nSince pension and other post-retirement benefit cost and obligations are measured on a discounted basis, the discount\nrates used to determine the net periodic benefit cost and the benefit obligation are significant assumptions. Discount rates used for our defined benefit and other post-retirement benefit plans are based on the yields constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plans. Discount rates of 4.57% for the U.S. plans and 4.03% for the Canadian plans were used to calculate the 2016 net periodic benefit cost, and represent a weighted average of the applicable rates for all U.S. and Canadian plans, respectively. A 25 basis-point change in the discount rates would impact annual before-tax net periodic benefit cost by approximately $1 million for U.S. plans and $4 million for Canadian plans. Discount rates of 4.10% for the U.S. plans and 3.81% for the Canadian plans were used to calculate the 2016 year-end benefit obligations and represent a weighted average of the applicable rates for all U.S. and Canadian plans, respectively. The weighted average discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation decreased approximately 0.47% for the U.S. plans and approximately 0.22% for the Canadian plans during 2016. The decrease in the benefit obligation discount rate and actuarial experience during 2016 resulted in an increase in benefit obligations at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nSee Note 26 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on pension and other post-retirement benefits.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had negative working capital of $2,133 million. This balance includes commercial paper liabilities totaling $1,453 million and current maturities of long-term debt of $551 million. We will rely upon cash flows from operations and various financing transactions, which may include debt and/or equity issuances, to fund our liquidity and capital requirements for 2017. SEP is expected to be self-funding through its cash flows from operations, use of its revolving credit facility and its access to capital markets. We receive cash distributions from SEP in accordance with the partnership agreement, which considers our level of ownership and incentive distribution rights.\nWe have access to five revolving credit facilities, including Spectra Capital's two facilities totaling $3.0 billion, SEP's $2.5 billion facility, Westcoast's 400 million Canadian dollar facility and Union Gas' 700 million Canadian dollar facility, with available capacity of $1.9 billion under SEP's credit facility and $2.9 billion under our other subsidiaries' credit facilities. These facilities are used principally as back-stops for commercial paper programs. At Spectra Capital, SEP and Westcoast, we primarily use commercial paper for temporary funding of capital expenditures. At Union Gas, we primarily use commercial paper for temporary funding of capital expenditures and to support short-term working capital fluctuations. We also utilize commercial paper, other variable-rate debt and interest rate swaps to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable-rate debt. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of available credit facilities and Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity for a discussion of effective shelf registrations.\nOur consolidated capital structure includes commercial paper, long-term debt (including current maturities), preferred stock of subsidiaries and total equity. As of December 31, 2016, our capital structure was 56.4% debt, 25.8% common equity of controlling interests and 17.8% noncontrolling interests and preferred stock of subsidiaries.\nCash flows from operations for our 100%-owned and majority-owned businesses are stable given that approximately 90% of revenues are derived from fee-based services, of which most are regulated. However, total operating cash flows are subject to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, earnings sensitivities to weather, commodity prices, distributions from our equity investments and the timing of cost recoveries pursuant to regulatory approvals. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion.\nCash distributions from our equity investment, DCP Midstream, can fluctuate, mostly as a result of earnings sensitivities to commodity prices, as well as its level of capital expenditures and other investing activities. DCP Midstream funds its operations and investing activities mostly from its operating cash flows, third-party debt and equity transactions associated with DCP Partners. DCP Midstream is required to make quarterly tax distributions to us based on allocated taxable income. In addition to tax distributions, periodic distributions are determined by DCP Midstream's board of directors based on its earnings, operating cash flows and other factors, including capital expenditures and other investing activities, commodity prices outlook and the credit environment. We received no tax or periodic distributions from DCP Midstream during 2016 and 2015. We received total tax and periodic distributions from DCP midstream of $237 million in 2014. These distributions are classified within Cash Flows from Operating Activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We continue to assess the effect of sustained lower commodity prices and other activities at DCP Midstream on cash expected to be received from DCP Midstream and adjust our expansion or other activities as necessary.\nIn addition, cash flows from our Canadian operations are generally used to fund the ongoing Canadian businesses and future Canadian growth. At December 31, 2016, $164 million of Cash and Cash Equivalents was held by our Canadian subsidiaries. Historically, we have reinvested a substantial portion of our Canadian operations' earnings in Canada. Earnings not needed by our Canadian operations have been distributed to Spectra Energy Corp (the U.S. parent) with minimal incremental U.S. tax liability. We anticipate continued substantial reinvestment of our future Canadian earnings in Canada; however, future distributions to Spectra Energy Corp may incur incremental U.S. tax at the U.S. statutory rate without the ability to use foreign tax credits. The timing of when distributions may incur such incremental U.S. tax depends on many factors, such as the amount of future capital expansions in Canada, the tax characterization of our distributions as returns of capital or dividends, the impacts of tax planning on merger and acquisition activities and tax legislation at the time of the distributions.\nAs we execute on our strategic objectives around organic growth and expansion projects, expansion expenditures are expected to approximate $4.6 billion in 2017 and $2.0 billion in 2018, excluding contributions from noncontrolling interests. The timing and extent of these expenditures are likely to vary significantly from year to year, depending mostly on general economic conditions and market requirements. Given that we expect to continue to pursue expansion and earnings growth opportunities over the next several years and also given the scheduled maturities of our existing debt instruments, capital resources will continue to include long-term borrowings and possibly securing additional sources of capital including debt and/or equity securities. We remain committed to maintaining a capital structure and liquidity profile that continue to support an investment-grade credit rating.\nCash Flow Analysis\nThe following table summarizes the changes in cash flows for each of the periods presented:\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(3,830\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,782\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,003\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>1,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(199\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the period\n</td> <td>213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at end of the period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $221 million to $2,026 million in 2016 compared to 2015. This change was driven mostly by non-cash goodwill impairments recorded in 2015, offset by higher earnings.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $26 million to $2,247 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This change was driven mostly by changes in working capital, mostly offset by lower earnings.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nNet cash flows used in investing activities increased $1,048 million to $3,830 million in 2016 compared to 2015. This change was driven mostly by:\n \u2022 a $902 million net increase in capital and investment expenditures and \n \u2022 a $396 million distribution received from Gulfstream with proceeds from a Gulfstream debt offering in 2015, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $204 million of proceeds related to the sale of Empress in 2016 and \n \u2022 a $148 million contribution to Gulfstream used to retire debt in 2016, compared to a $248 million contribution in 2015.  Net cash flows used in investing activities increased $779 million to $2,782 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This change was driven mostly by:\n \u2022 a $685 million net increase in capital and investment expenditures and \n \u2022 a $248 million contribution to Gulfstream used to retire debt, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $396 million distribution received from Gulfstream with proceeds from a Gulfstream debt offering in 2015, compared to a $200 million distribution from SESH with proceeds from a SESH debt offering in 2014.

Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities increased $1,350 million to $1,890 million in 2016 compared to 2015. This change was driven mostly by:\n \u2022 $879 million of proceeds from the issuance of Spectra Energy's common stock in 2016, \n \u2022 net commercial paper issuances of $319 million in 2016, compared to net commercial paper redemptions of $439 million in 2015 and \n \u2022 $229 million of proceeds from the issuance of Westcoast's preferred stock in 2016, compared to $84 million of proceeds in 2015, partially offset by \n \u2022 $531 million of net proceeds from long-term debt in 2016, compared to net proceeds of $1,300 million in 2015.  Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $540 million in 2015 compared to $199 million used in financing activities in 2014. This $739 million change was driven mostly by:\n \u2022 $1,300 million of net proceeds from long-term debt in 2015, compared to net repayments of long-term debt of $156 million in 2014 and \n \u2022 $546 million proceeds from the issuance of SEP units in 2015, compared to $327 million in 2014, partially offset by \n \u2022 net commercial paper redemptions of $439 million in 2015, compared to net commercial paper issuances of $574 million in 2014.

On March 1, 2016, we entered into an equity distribution agreement under which we may sell and issue common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $500 million. The equity distribution agreement allows us to offer and sell common stock at prices deemed appropriate through sales agents. Sales of common stock under the equity distribution agreement will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions through the facilities of the NYSE, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed upon by one or more of the sales agents and us. We intend to use the net proceeds from sales under this at-the-market program for general corporate purposes, including investments in subsidiaries to fund capital expenditures. We issued approximately 12.9 million of common shares to the public under this program, for total net proceeds of $383 million through December 31, 2016.\nIn April 2016, we issued 16.1 million common shares to the public for net proceeds of approximately $479 million. Net proceeds from the offering were used to purchase approximately 10.4 million common units in SEP. SEP used the proceeds from our unit purchase for general corporate purposes, including the funding of its current expansion capital plan.\nSEP Common Unit Issuances. In 2016, SEP issued 12.8 million common units to the public under its at-the-market program and approximately 262,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy. Total net proceeds to SEP were $591 million (net proceeds to Spectra Energy were $579 million). In April 2016, SEP issued 10.4 million common units and 0.2 million general partner units to Spectra Energy in a private placement transaction.\nIn connection with the issuances of the units, a $50 million gain ($31 million net of tax) to Additional Paid-in Capital and a $528 million increase in Equity-Noncontrolling Interests were recorded in 2016. The issuances decreased Spectra Energy's ownership in SEP from 78% to 75% at December 31, 2016.\nIn 2017, SEP has issued 0.5 million common units to the public and approximately 9,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy, for total net proceeds to SEP of $21 million (net proceeds to Spectra Energy were $21 million) through its at-the-market program.\nWestcoast Preferred Stock Issuance. On August 30, 2016, Westcoast issued 12 million Cumulative 5-Year Minimum Rate Reset Redeemable First Preferred Shares, Series 12 for an aggregate principle amount of 300 million Canadian dollars (approximately $229 million as of the issuance date). Net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.\nSignificant Financing Activities-2015\nDebt Issuances.

SEP Common Unit Issuances. In March 2015, SEP entered into an equity distribution agreement under which it may sell and issue common units up to an aggregate offering price of $500 million, and in December 2015, SEP replaced the equity distribution agreement. The terms of this new equity distribution agreement are substantially similar to those in SEP's previous agreements and allow SEP to sell and issue up to an aggregate offering price of $1 billion of common units. This at-the-market offering program allows SEP to offer and sell its common units, representing limited partner interests, at prices it deems appropriate through a sales agent. Sales of common units, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NYSE, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed to between SEP and the sales agent.\nSEP issued 12.0 million limited partner units to the public in 2015 under its at-the-market program and approximately 245,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy. Total net proceeds to SEP were $557 million (net proceeds to Spectra Energy were $546 million). The net proceeds were used for SEP's general partnership purposes, which may have included debt repayments, capital expenditures and/or additions to working capital.\nWestcoast Preferred Stock Issuance. In December 2015, Westcoast issued 4.6 million Cumulative 5-Year Minimum Rate\nReset Redeemable First Preferred Shares, Series 10 for an aggregate principal amount of 115 million Canadian dollars (approximately $84 million as of the issuance date). Net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund capital expenditures, to refinance maturing debt obligations and for other corporate purposes.\nSignificant Financing Activities-2014\nDebt Issuances.

Per the terms of the agreements, collateralized debt is excluded from the calculation of the ratio. This ratio was 56.3% at December 31, 2016. \n (b) Revolving credit facility contains a covenant that requires SEP to maintain a ratio of total Consolidated Indebtedness-to-Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the agreement, of 5.0 to 1 or less. As of December 31, 2016, this ratio was 3.8 to 1. \n (c) U.S. dollar equivalent at December 31, 2016. The revolving credit facility is 400 million Canadian dollars and contains a covenant that requires the Westcoast non-consolidated debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 75%. The ratio was 33.2% at December 31, 2016. \n (d) U.S. dollar equivalent at December 31, 2016. The revolving credit facility is 700 million Canadian dollars and contains a covenant that requires the Union Gas debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 75% and a provision which requires Union Gas to repay all borrowings under the facility for a period of two days during the second quarter of each year. The ratio was 69.0% at December 31, 2016.  On September 29, 2016, we entered into a new one-year, $2 billion credit facility at Spectra Capital, which expires in 2017. Proceeds from borrowings under the credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes. Amounts borrowed under the credit facility must be repaid following any change in control, including any that results from the proposed merger with Enbridge.\nOn April 29, 2016, we amended the Union Gas and SEP revolving credit agreements. The Union Gas revolving credit facility was increased to 700 million Canadian dollars and the SEP revolving facility was increased to $2.5 billion. The expiration of both facilities was extended, with both facilities expiring in 2021.\nOn April 29, 2016, we amended the Westcoast and Spectra Capital revolving credit agreements. The expiration of both credit facilities was extended, with both facilities expiring in 2021.\nThe issuances of commercial paper, letters of credit and revolving borrowings reduce the amounts available under the credit facilities. As of December 31, 2016, there were no letters of credit issued or revolving borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities.\nOur credit agreements contain various covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with those covenants. In addition, our credit agreements allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or in some cases, due to the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. Our debt and credit agreements do not contain provisions that trigger an acceleration of indebtedness based solely on the occurrence of a material adverse change in our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs noted above, the terms of our Spectra Capital credit agreements require our consolidated debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, as defined in the agreement, to be 65% or lower. Per the terms of the agreement, collateralized debt is excluded from the calculation of the ratio. This ratio was 56.3% at December 31, 2016. Our equity and, as a result, this ratio, is sensitive to significant movements of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar due to the significance of our Canadian operations as discussed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Risk.\u201d Based on the strength of our total capitalization as of December 31, 2016, however, it is not likely that a material adverse effect would occur as a result of a weakened Canadian dollar.\nDividends. Consistent with our near-term objective of increasing our cash dividend by $0.14 per year through 2018, we announced a $0.14 annual dividend increase on January 5, 2017. We expect to continue our policy of paying regular cash dividends. The declaration and payment of dividends are subject to the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the financial condition, earnings and capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per common share on January 5, 2017 payable on March 1, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2017.\nOther Financing Matters. Spectra Energy Corp, Spectra Capital and SEP have effective shelf registration statements on file with the SEC to register the issuance of unlimited amounts of various equity and debt securities. SEP also has $359 million available as of December 31, 2016 for the issuance of limited partner common units under another effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC related to its at-the-market program. Westcoast and Union Gas have an aggregate 1.2 billion Canadian dollars (approximately $893 million) available as of December 31, 2016 for the issuance of debt securities in the Canadian market under their medium term note shelf prospectuses, which expired on January 4, 2017.\nOn March 18, 2016, Westcoast filed a new 1 billion Canadian dollar short form base shelf prospectus, which provides for the issuance of first preferred shares. As of the date of this filing, Westcoast has 700 million Canadian dollars (approximately $521 million) available for the issuance of preferred shares under this prospectus, which expires on April 18, 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include financial guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. See Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of guarantee arrangements.\nMost of the guarantee arrangements that we enter into enhance the credit standings of certain subsidiaries, non-consolidated entities or less than 100%-owned entities, enabling them to conduct business. As such, these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility of us having to honor our contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of our subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events. Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of our operations.\nWe do not have material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures, except for normal operating lease arrangements, guarantee arrangements and financings entered into by DCP Midstream and our other equity investments. For additional information on these commitments, see Notes 21 and 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations\nWe enter into contracts that require payment of cash at certain periods based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices. The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations for each of the periods presented. The table below excludes all amounts classified as Current Liabilities on the December 31, 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet other than Current Maturities of Long-Term Debt. It is expected that the majority of Current Liabilities will be paid in cash in 2017.\nContractual Obligations as of December 31, 2016\nTable 251: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 &\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020 &\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022 &\nBeyond\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (b)\n</td> <td>331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations: (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Firm capacity payments (d)\n</td> <td>4,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy commodity contracts (e)\n</td> <td>303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchase obligations (f)\n</td> <td>1,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (g)\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\n (a) See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

For contracts where the price paid is based on an index, the amount is based on forward market prices at December 31, 2016. \n (f) Includes contracts for software and consulting or advisory services. Amounts also include contractual obligations for engineering, procurement and construction costs for pipeline projects. Amounts exclude certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand, where the timing of the purchase cannot be determined. \n (g) Includes estimated 2017 retirement plan contributions (see Note 26). We are unable to estimate retirement plan contributions beyond 2017 due primarily to uncertainties about market performance of plan assets. Excludes cash obligations for asset retirement activities (see Note 16) because the amount of cash flows to be paid to settle the asset retirement obligations is not known with certainty as we may use internal or external resources to perform retirement activities. Amounts also exclude reserves for litigation and environmental remediation (see Note 21) and regulatory liabilities (see Note 5) because we are uncertain as to the amount and/or timing of when cash payments will be required. Amounts also exclude deferred income taxes and investment tax credits on the Consolidated Balance Sheet since cash payments for income taxes are determined primarily by taxable income for each discrete fiscal year.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, credit exposure, interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. We have established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Our Chief Financial Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing credit risk and commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of NGLs and natural gas purchased as a result of our investment in DCP Midstream and processing associated with certain of our U.S. pipeline assets. Price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of these energy commodities. Our exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including contract size, length, market liquidity, location and unique or specific contract terms.\nDCP Midstream manages its direct exposure to market prices separate from Spectra Energy, and utilizes various risk management strategies, including the use of commodity derivatives.\nWe are exposed to market price fluctuations of NGLs, natural gas and oil in our Field Services segment. Based on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, a 10\u00a2 per-gallon change in NGL prices would affect our annual pre-tax earnings by approximately $25 million in 2017 and $40 million in 2016 for Field Services. For the same periods, a 50\u00a2 per-MMBtu change in natural gas prices would affect our annual pre-tax earnings by approximately $18 million in both periods, and a $10 per-barrel change in oil prices would affect our annual pre-tax earnings by approximately $20 million in both periods.\nThese hypothetical calculations consider estimated production levels, but do not consider other potential effects that might result from such changes in commodity prices. The actual effect of commodity price changes on our earnings could be significantly different than these estimates.\nSee also Notes 1 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. Our principal customers for natural gas transmission, storage, and gathering and processing services are industrial end-users, marketers, exploration and production companies, LDCs and utilities located throughout the U.S. and Canada. Customers on the Express-Platte system are primarily refineries located in the Rocky Mountain and Midwestern states of the U.S. Other customers include oil producers and marketing entities. We have concentrations of receivables from natural gas utilities and their affiliates, industrial customers and marketers throughout these regions, as well as retail distribution customers in Canada. These concentrations of customers may affect our overall credit risk in that risk factors can negatively affect the credit quality of the entire sector. Credit risk associated with gas distribution services are primarily affected by general economic conditions in the service territory.\nWhere exposed to credit risk, we analyze the customers' financial condition prior to entering into an agreement, establish credit limits and monitor the appropriateness of those limits on an ongoing basis. We also obtain parental guarantees, cash deposits or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support, where appropriate, based on our financial analysis of the customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each contract. A significant amount of our credit exposures for transmission, storage, and gathering and processing services are with customers who have an investment-grade rating (or the equivalent based on our evaluation) or are secured by collateral. However, we cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including possible declines in our customers' creditworthiness.\nBased on our policies for managing credit risk, our current exposures and our credit and other reserves, we do not anticipate a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non-performance by any counterparty.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. We manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable-rate exposures to percentages of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. We also enter into financial derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps and rate lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See also Notes 1, 17 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had interest rate hedges in place for various purposes. We are party to pay floating-receive fixed\u201d interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $2 billion to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt that arise as a result of changes in market interest rates. These swaps also allow us to transform a portion of the underlying interest payments related to our long-term fixed-rate debt securities into variable-rate interest payments in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable-rate debt.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2016, it was estimated that if short-term interest rates average 100 basis points higher (lower) in 2017 than in 2016, interest expense, net of offsetting interest income, would fluctuate by $39 million before tax. Comparatively, based on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2015, had short-term interest rates averaged 100 basis points higher (lower) in 2016 than in 2015, it was estimated that interest expense, net of offsetting interest income, would have fluctuated by approximately $35 million. These amounts were estimated by considering the effect of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate debt outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges, short term investments, and cash and cash equivalents outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur cost of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon, among other things, rates of return on plan assets. These plan assets expose us to price fluctuations in equity markets. In addition, our captive insurance companies maintain various investments to fund certain business risks and losses. Those investments may, from time to time, include investments in equity securities. Volatility of equity markets, particularly declines, will not only impact our cost of providing retirement and postretirement benefits, but will also impact the funding level requirements of those benefits.\nWe manage equity price risk by, among other things, diversifying our investments in equity investments, setting target allocations of investment types, periodically reviewing actual asset allocations and rebalancing allocations if warranted, and utilizing external investment advisors.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk from our Canadian operations. To mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, contracts may be denominated in or indexed to the U.S. dollar and/or local inflation rates, or investments may be naturally hedged through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency.\nTo monitor our currency exchange rate risks, we use sensitivity analysis, which measures the effect of devaluation of the Canadian dollar. An average 10% devaluation in the Canadian dollar exchange rate during 2016 would have resulted in an estimated net loss on the translation of local currency earnings of approximately $22 million on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, if a 10% devaluation had occurred on December 31, 2016, the Consolidated Balance Sheet would have been negatively impacted by $389 million through a cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI and this devaluation would result in an immaterial impact to our debt-to-total capitalization ratio. At December 31, 2016, one U.S. dollar translated into 1.34 Canadian dollars.\nAs discussed earlier, we maintain credit facilities that typically include financial covenants which limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of total capital for Spectra Energy or of a specific subsidiary. Failure to maintain these covenants could preclude us from issuing commercial paper or letters of credit or borrowing under our revolving credit facilities and could require other affiliates to immediately pay down any outstanding drawn amounts under other revolving credit agreements, which could adversely affect cash flows or restrict business. As a result of the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated equity, these fluctuations have a direct impact on our ability to maintain certain of these financial covenants.\nOTHER ISSUES\nFor information on other issues, see Notes 5 and 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nThroughout 2016, we continued to successfully execute the long-term strategies we outlined for our shareholders-meeting the needs of our customers, generating strong earnings and cash flows from our fee-based assets, executing capital expansion plans that underlie our growth objectives and maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. These results, combined with future growth opportunities, led our Board of Directors to approve an increase in our quarterly dividend effective with the first quarter of 2017 to $0.44 per share, which represents an increase in our annual dividend by $0.14 per share per year.\nDuring 2016, our earnings increased mainly due to expansion projects at Spectra Energy Partners and impairments in 2015 at Field Services, partially offset by pipeline inspection and repair costs related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania at Spectra Energy Partners and a lower Canadian dollar at Distribution and Western Canada Transmission & Processing.\nWe reported net income from controlling interests of $693 million and $1.00 of earnings per share for 2016 compared to net income from controlling interests of $196 million and $0.29 of earnings per share for 2015.\nEarnings highlights for 2016 compared to 2015 include the following:\n \u2022 Spectra Energy Partners' earnings benefited mainly from expansion projects, more than offset by pipeline inspection and repair costs related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania. \n \u2022 Distribution's earnings remained flat mainly due to incremental earnings from the 2015 Dawn-Parkway expansion project and higher storage margins, offset by the effect of a lower Canadian dollar and warmer weather. \n \u2022 Western Canada Transmission & Processing's earnings decreased mainly due to lower firm gathering and processing revenues and the effect of a lower Canadian dollar, partially offset by lower plant turnaround costs. \n \u2022 Field Services' earnings increased mainly due to the 2015 impairments of goodwill and other assets and an increase in gathering and processing margins, partially offset by expiration of hedges in 2016 and unfavorable results of initiatives to mitigate commodity price risk.  We invested $3.9 billion of capital and investment expenditures in 2016, including $3.3 billion of expansion and investment capital expenditures. Successful execution of our 2016 projects allowed us to continue to achieve aggregate returns over the past several years, consistent with our targeted return on capital employed range. Return on capital employed as it relates to expansion projects is calculated by us as incremental earnings before interest and taxes, generated by a project, divided by the total cost of the project. We continue to foresee significant expansion capital spending over the next several years, with approximately $4.6 billion planned for 2017, excluding contributions from noncontrolling interests. Concurrently, we executed on identified opportunities leveraging our asset footprint to capture incremental growth, connecting large diverse markets with growing supply throughout North America.\nWe are committed to an investment-grade balance sheet and continued prudent financial management of our capital structure. Therefore, financing growth activities will continue to be based on our strong and growing fee-based earnings and cash flows as well as the issuance of debt and equity securities. As of December 31, 2016, our revolving credit facilities included Spectra Energy Capital, LLC's (Spectra Capital's) two facilities totaling $3.0 billion, SEP's $2.5 billion facility, Westcoast's 400 million Canadian dollar facility, and Union Gas' 700 million Canadian dollar facility. These facilities are used principally as back-stops for commercial paper programs. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio was 56.4% and 59.8%, respectively.\nOn September 6, 2016, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Enbridge under which Enbridge and Spectra Energy will combine in a stock-for-stock merger transaction, which values Spectra Energy's stock at approximately $28 billion, based on the closing price of Enbridge's common shares as of September 2, 2016. This transaction was approved by the boards of directors and shareholders of both Spectra Energy and Enbridge and has received all necessary regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to close in February 27, 2017.\nOur Strategy. Our strategy is to create superior and sustainable value for our investors, customers, employees and communities by delivering natural gas, liquids and crude oil to premium markets. We will grow our business by way of organic growth, greenfield expansions and strategic acquisitions, with a steadfast focus on safety, reliability, customer responsiveness and profitability. We intend to accomplish this by:\n \u2022 Building off the strength of our asset base. \n \u2022 Maximizing that base through sector leading operations and service. \n \u2022 Effectively executing the projects we have secured. \n \u2022 Securing new growth opportunities that add value for our investors within each of our business segments. \n \u2022 Expanding our value chain participation into complementary infrastructure assets.  Natural gas supply dynamics continue to evolve, and there is general recognition that natural gas can be an effective solution for meeting the energy needs of North America and beyond. This causes us to be optimistic about future growth opportunities. Identified opportunities include growth in gas-fired power generation and industrial markets, LNG exports from North America, growth related to moving new sources of gas supplies to markets (including exports to Mexico) and significant new liquids pipeline infrastructure. With our advantage of providing continuous access from leading supply regions through to the last mile of pipe in growing markets, we expect to continue expanding our assets and operations to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\nCrude oil supply dynamics also continue to evolve as North American production moved from growth to decline. In recent years, growing North American crude oil production displaced imports from overseas and led to increased demand for crude oil transportation and logistics. Although depressed global crude oil prices resulted in declining North American oil production, we expect a return to attractive pricing and growing North American production outlook. Thus, we remain confident about long-term growth in North American oil production and our ability to capture future liquids and crude oil pipeline business.\nSuccessful execution of our strategy will depend on maintaining our reputation and leadership as a safe and reliable operator and the effective execution of our capital projects. Continued growth and new opportunities will be determined by key factors, such as the continued growth and production of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil within North America and our ability to provide creative solutions to meet the markets' evolving energy needs in both North America and beyond.\nWe continue to be actively engaged in the national discussions in both the U.S. and Canada regarding energy policy and have taken a lead role in shaping policy as it relates to pipeline safety and operations.\nSignificant Economic Factors For Our Business. Our regulated businesses are generally economically stable and are not significantly affected in the short-term by changing commodity prices. However, all of our businesses can be negatively affected in the long-term by sustained downturns in the economy or prolonged decreases in the demand for crude oil, natural gas and/or NGLs, all of which are beyond our control and could impair our ability to meet long-term goals.\nMost of our revenues are based on regulated tariff rates, which include the recovery of certain fuel costs. Lower overall economic output would reduce the volume of natural gas and NGLs transported and distributed or gathered and processed at our plants, and the volume of crude oil transported, resulting in lower earnings and cash flows. This decline would primarily affect distribution revenues and gathering and processing revenues, potentially in the short term. Transmission revenues could be affected by long-term economic declines resulting in the non-renewal of long-term contracts at the time of expiration. Pipeline transportation and storage customers continue to renew most contracts as they expire. Gathering and processing revenues and the earnings and cash distributions from our Field Services segment are also affected by volumes of natural gas made available to our systems, which are primarily driven by levels of natural gas drilling activity. While experiencing a decline in production from conventional gas wells, natural gas exploration and drilling activity in the areas that affect our Western Canada Transmission & Processing and Field Services segments remain stable, primarily driven by recent positive supply push\u201d developments around unconventional gas reserves production in numerous locations within North America as discussed further below and by demand pull\u201d projects in BC and the Pacific Northwest.\nOur combined key natural gas markets-the northeastern and the southeastern U.S., the Pacific Northwest, BC and Ontario-are projected to continue to exhibit higher than average annual growth in natural gas demand versus the North American and continental U.S. average growth rates through 2020. This demand growth is primarily driven by the natural gas-fired electricity generation sector, including regional Gulf Coast exports of LNG, exports to Mexico and a significant industrial and petrochemical expansion. The natural gas industry is currently experiencing a significant shift in the sources of supply, and this dramatic change is affecting our growth strategies. Traditionally, supply to our markets has come from the Gulf Coast region, both onshore and offshore, as well as from natural gas reserves in western and eastern Canada. The national supply\nprofile still includes significant production from traditional sources in the Rockies, Midcontinent, and the U.S. Gulf Coast and is augmented by significant resource growth in Appalachia and west Texas. Also, significant supply sources continue to be identified for development in western Canada. These supply shifts are shaping the growth strategies that we pursue, and therefore, will affect the nature of the projects anticipated in the capital and investment expenditure increases discussed below in Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d Recent social and environmental activism and political pressures have arisen around the production processes associated with extracting natural gas from shale basins. Although we continue to believe that natural gas will remain a viable energy solution for the U.S. and Canada, these pressures could increase costs and/or cause uncertainty on timing of permitting and execution of new projects.\nOur key crude oil markets include the Rocky Mountain and Midwest states. Growth in our business is dependent on incremental crude oil supply from North American sources and the ability of that supply to displace imported crude oil from overseas. Lower crude oil prices over the past two years have adversely affected the availability and cost-competitiveness of North American crude oil supply. This has not adversely affected our crude oil pipeline business, but sustained low oil prices could have a negative impact on our current business and associated growth opportunities.\nIn certain areas of Western Canada Transmission & Processing's operations, lower natural gas prices resulting from increasing North American gas supply have reduced producer demand for expansions of the BC gas processing plants as well as renewals of existing gas processing contracts, and could continue to do so as long as gas prices remain below historical norms.\nDCP Midstream's business has commodity price exposure as a result of being compensated for certain services in the form of commodities rather than cash. For gathering and processing services and sales, DCP Midstream predominantly receives commodities as payment but may also receive fees, depending on the types of contracts. Over the past two years, commodity prices have declined substantially and have experienced significant volatility. Drilling activity levels vary by geographic area. As a result of lower commodity prices, some regions may see larger reductions in activity than others based on basin economics. Sustained low commodity prices could result in a decrease in exploration and development activities in the fields served by DCP Midstream's gas gathering, residue gas and NGL pipeline transportation systems, and DCP Midstream's natural gas treating and processing plants, which could lead to further reduced utilization of these assets.\nWhile the increase in natural gas supply has been largely positive for midstream companies, lower price dynamics and shifting preferences on producing basins may impact some of our business and pipelines in the long-term. The supply increase has had a negative impact on the seasonal price spreads historically seen between the summer and winter months. As a result, the value of storage assets and contracts has declined in recent years, however, significant increases in demand on the Gulf Coast, particularly for exports, should improve the value of our storage service in the future.\nOur businesses in the U.S. and Canada are subject to laws and regulations on the federal, state and provincial levels. Regulations applicable to the natural gas transmission, crude oil transportation and storage industries have a significant effect on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate. Changes to regulations are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that any future changes will have on our businesses.\nThese laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. Environmental laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties. In particular, compliance with major Clean Air Act regulatory programs may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures to obtain permits, evaluate off-site impacts of our operations, install emissions control equipment, and otherwise assure compliance.\nOur interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations administered by PHMSA of the DOT. These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines.\nPHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in a reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition or cash flows. Additionally, PHMSA issued an interim final rule, effective January 2017, that addresses safety issues related to underground natural gas storage facilities. We believe our existing storage facilities conform to the majority of the requirements of the new rule.\nIn light of the changing environmental and safety laws and regulations described above, we are evaluating efforts required to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations and, in addition, are assessing ways to improve overall system integrity, efficiency and reliability. The capital costs to effectively modernize our pipelines accordingly will be substantial and will be incurred over several years.\nAdditionally, investments and projects located in Canada expose us to risks related to Canadian laws, taxes, economic conditions, fluctuations in currency rates, political conditions and policies of the Canadian government. During the past several years, the Canadian dollar has fluctuated compared to the U.S. dollar, which affected earnings to varying degrees for brief periods. Changes in the exchange rate or any other factors are difficult to predict and may affect our future results.\nCertain of our segments' earnings are affected by fluctuations in commodity prices, especially the earnings of Field Services, which is most sensitive to changes in NGL prices. DCP Midstream manages its direct exposure to these market prices separate from Spectra Energy, and utilizes various risk management strategies, including the use of commodity derivatives.\nBased on current projections, our expected effective income tax rate will approximate 20%-21% for 2017. Our overall expected tax rate largely depends on the proportion of earnings in the U.S. to the earnings of our Canadian operations. Our earnings in the U.S. are subject to a combined federal and state statutory tax rate of approximately 37%. Our earnings in Canada are subject to a combined federal and provincial statutory tax rate of approximately 26%, but we anticipate an effective Canadian tax rate of less than 1% for 2017, driven primarily by the recognition of certain regulatory tax benefits. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for further discussion about the tax impact of repatriating funds generated from our Canadian operations to Spectra Energy Corp (the U.S. parent).\nOur strategic objectives include a critical focus on capital expansion projects that will require access to capital markets. An inability to access capital at competitive rates could affect our ability to implement our strategy. Market disruptions or a downgrade in our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowings or affect our ability to access one or more sources of liquidity.\nDuring the past few years, capital expansion projects have been exposed to cost pressures associated with the availability of skilled labor, the pricing of materials and challenges associated with ensuring the protection of our environment and continual safety enhancements to our facilities. We have also experienced increased scrutiny placed on the permitting and construction of new projects from social and environmental activism; which can sometimes impact the timing of when construction activities, and the ultimate completion of a project, can occur relative to the expected timeline. We maintain a strong focus on project management activities to address these pressures as we move forward with planned expansion opportunities. Significant cost increases could negatively affect the returns ultimately earned on current and future expansions.\nFor further information related to management's assessment of our risk factors, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n2016 Compared to 2015\nOperating Revenues. The $318 million decrease was driven by:\n \u2022 lower firm gathering and processing revenues, a decrease from the sale of Empress in August 2016 and lower NGL prices at Western Canada Transmission & Processing, \n \u2022 lower natural gas prices passed through to customers and lower usage due to warmer weather, partially offset by growth in the number of customers, incremental earnings from the 2015 Dawn-Parkway expansion project, higher rates due to increased demand side management (DSM) program charges and higher storage margins at Distribution and \n \u2022 the effects of a lower Canadian dollar at Distribution and Western Canada Transmission & Processing, partially offset by \n \u2022 higher revenues from expansion projects at Spectra Energy Partners.  Operating Expenses. The $474 million decrease was driven by:\n \u2022 lower plant turnaround costs, lower costs of NGL sales and a decrease from the sale of Empress in August 2016 at Western Canada Transmission & Processing, \n \u2022 lower natural gas prices passed through to customers and lower volumes of natural gas sold due to warmer weather, partially offset by growth in the number of customers and higher DSM program charges, net of lower employee related charges at Distribution, \n \u2022 the effects of a lower Canadian dollar at Distribution and Western Canada Transmission & Processing and \n \u2022 the 2015 goodwill impairment charges associated with the Westcoast acquisition in 2002 at Other, partially offset by \n \u2022 higher costs related to the merger with Enbridge and higher employee benefits costs at Other and \n \u2022 pipeline inspection and repair costs, higher costs related to expansion and property tax accruals due to the absence of a 2015 tax benefit at Spectra Energy Partners.  Gain (loss) on sales of other assets and other, net. The $30 million change was primarily the result of the sale of the Pesh natural gas processing facilities in the fourth quarter of 2016 at Western Canada Transmission & Processing.\nOther Income and Expenses. The $447 million change was primarily attributable to higher equity earnings from Field Services mainly due to the 2015 impairments of goodwill and other assets at DCP Midstream.\nInterest Expense. The $42 million decrease was mainly due to higher capitalized interest, the reversal of an interest accrual related to the release of tax reserves, and a lower Canadian dollar, partially offset by higher average long-term debt balances.\nIncome Tax Expense. The $55 million increase was primarily attributable to tax benefits associated with loss on investment due to impairments of goodwill and other assets at DCP Midstream in 2015, partially offset by the sale of Empress, tax rate changes and the release of tax reserves in 2016.\nThe effective tax rate was 17.5% in 2016 compared to 26% in 2015. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for reconciliations of our effective tax rates to the statutory tax rate.\nNet Income-Noncontrolling Interests. The $63 million increase was driven primarily by higher noncontrolling ownership interests at Spectra Energy Partners, partially offset by lower earnings at Spectra Energy Partners.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nOperating Revenues. The $669 million decrease was driven by:\n \u2022 the effects of a lower Canadian dollar at Distribution and Western Canada Transmission & Processing, \n \u2022 lower NGL prices, lower sales volumes of residual natural gas and non-cash mark-to-market gains and losses associated with the risk management program, net of an increase from settlement gains associated with the risk management program at Empress at Western Canada Transmission & Processing and \n \u2022 lower customer usage due to warmer weather, net of growth in the number of customers at Distribution, partially offset by \n \u2022 revenues from expansion projects primarily on Texas Eastern and East Tennessee at Spectra Energy Partners.  Operating Expenses. The $173 million decrease was driven by:\n \u2022 the effects of a lower Canadian dollar at Distribution and Western Canada Transmission & Processing, \n \u2022 decreased volumes of natural gas purchases for extraction and make-up and lower costs of sales at Western Canada Transmission & Processing and \n \u2022 lower volumes of natural gas sold due to warmer weather, net of growth in the number of customers at Distribution, partially offset by \n \u2022 goodwill impairment charges associated with the Westcoast acquisition in 2002 at Other.  Other Income and Expenses. The $596 million decrease was attributable to lower equity earnings from Field\nServices mainly due to decreased commodity prices and goodwill and other asset impairments.\nInterest Expense. The $43 million decrease was mainly due to a lower Canadian dollar and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by higher average long-term debt balances.\nIncome Tax Expense. The $221 million decrease was mainly due to tax benefits associated with loss on investment due to impairments of goodwill and other assets at DCP Midstream, lower earnings and the effect of a lower Canadian dollar.\nThe effective tax rate was 26% in 2015 compared to 23% in 2014. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for reconciliations of our effective tax rates to the statutory tax rate.\nNet Income-Noncontrolling Interests. The $63 million increase was driven by higher earnings from Spectra Energy Partners.\nFor a more detailed discussion of earnings drivers, see the segment discussions that follow.\nSegment Results\nManagement evaluates segment performance based on earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are managed at the parent-company levels, so the gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and interest and dividend income are excluded from the segments' EBITDA. We consider segment EBITDA to be a good indicator of each segment's operating performance from its operations, as it represents the results of our operations without regard to financing methods or capital structures. Our segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate EBITDA in the same manner.\nSpectra Energy Partners provides transmission, storage and gathering of natural gas for customers in various regions of the northeastern and southeastern U.S. and operates a crude oil pipeline system that connects Canadian and U.S. producers to refineries in the U.S. Rocky Mountain and Midwest regions.\nDistribution provides retail natural gas distribution services in Ontario, Canada, as well as natural gas transmission and storage services to other utilities and energy market participants.\nWestern Canada Transmission & Processing provides transmission of natural gas and natural gas gathering and processing services to customers in western Canada, the U.S. Pacific Northwest and the Maritime Provinces in Canada.\nField Services gathers, compresses, treats, processes, transports, stores and sells natural gas; produces, fractionates, transports, stores and sells NGLs; recovers and sells condensate; and trades and markets natural gas and NGLs. It conducts operations through DCP Midstream, which is owned 50% by us and 50% by Phillips 66. DCP Midstream operates in a diverse number of regions, including the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Niobrara/DJ Basin and the Midcontinent. As of December 31, 2016, DCP Midstream had an approximate 21% ownership interest in DCP Partners, a publicly-traded master limited partnership.\nSegment EBITDA is summarized in the following table. Detailed discussions follow.\nEBITDA by Business Segment \n___________\n (a) Includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to segment EBITDA.  The amounts discussed below include intercompany transactions that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSpectra Energy Partners\n\n____________\n (a) Thousand barrels per day.  2016 Compared to 2015\nOperating Revenues. The $78 million increase was driven by:\n \u2022 a $113 million increase due to expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern and Algonquin, \n \u2022 a $7 million increase in storage revenues due to new contracts at higher rates and \n \u2022 a $7 million increase in crude oil transportation revenues due to the Express Enhancement expansion project placed into service in October 2016, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $16 million decrease in recoveries of electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers, \n \u2022 a $15 million decrease in processing revenues primarily due to lower volumes, \n \u2022 a $10 million decrease in crude oil transportation revenues, as a result of lower volumes primarily on the Platte pipeline, substantially offset by increased tariff rates mainly on the Express pipeline and \n \u2022 a $9 million decrease in natural gas transportation revenues mainly from interruptible transportation on Texas Eastern and M&N U.S. and short-term firm transportation on Algonquin. \nOperating, Maintenance and Other. The $89 million increase was driven by:\n \u2022 an $80 million increase due to pipeline inspection and repair costs related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania, \n \u2022 a $47 million increase in costs related to expansion and \n \u2022 an $11 million increase in property tax accruals due to the absence of a 2015 tax benefit, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $16 million decrease in electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers, \n \u2022 an $11 million decrease in power costs due to lower usage in 2016 and maintenance costs on the Express and Platte pipelines, \n \u2022 a $9 million decrease due to a prior year non-cash impairment charge on Ozark Gas Gathering, \n \u2022 an $8 million decrease in operating costs and \n \u2022 a $4 million decrease in project development costs.  Other Income and Expenses. The $15 million increase was mainly due to higher allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) resulting from higher capital spending on expansion projects, partially offset by the absence of equity earnings from Sand Hills and Southern Hills owned until October 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nOperating Revenues. The $186 million increase was driven by:\n \u2022 a $137 million increase due to expansion projects, primarily on Texas Eastern and East Tennessee, \n \u2022 a $54 million increase in crude oil transportation revenues as a result of increased tariff rates mainly on the Express pipeline and higher volumes on the Express and Platte pipelines and \n \u2022 a $43 million increase in recoveries of electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $22 million decrease in processing revenues primarily due to lower prices, net of higher volumes, \n \u2022 an $18 million decrease in inventory settlement revenues due primarily to sales of excess tank oil in 2014 and lower crude oil prices on the Express and Platte pipelines, \n \u2022 an $8 million decrease in natural gas transportation revenues mainly from short-term firm and interruptible transportation on Texas Eastern and other revenue on East Tennessee, net of higher firm transportation on Algonquin and \n \u2022 a $6 million decrease in storage revenues due to lower rates.  Operating, Maintenance and Other. The $47 million increase was driven by:\n \u2022 a $43 million increase in electric power and other costs passed through to gas transmission customers, \n \u2022 a $9 million increase due to the non-cash impairment charge on Ozark Gas Gathering and \n \u2022 an $8 million increase in operating costs, net of employee benefit costs, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $21 million decrease due to lower ad valorem tax accruals and \n \u2022 a $5 million decrease from project development costs expensed in 2014.  Other Income and Expenses. The $97 million increase was primarily due to higher AFUDC resulting from higher capital spending and higher equity earnings from Sand Hills as a result of the continued ramp up and the expansion of the pipeline, as well as the fourth quarter 2014 U.S. Asset Dropdown of an additional 24.95% interest in SESH.\nMatters Affecting Future Spectra Energy Partners Results\nWe plan to grow our earnings through capital efficient projects, such as transportation and storage expansion to support a two-pronged supply push\u201d / market pull\u201d strategy, as well as continued focus on optimizing the performance of the existing operations through organizational efficiencies and cost control. Supply push\u201d is when producers agree to pay to transport\nspecified volumes of natural gas in order to support the construction of new pipelines or the expansion of existing pipelines. Market pull\u201d is taking gas away from established liquid supply points and building pipeline transportation capacity to satisfy end-user demand in new markets or demand growth in existing markets. Future earnings growth will be dependent on the success of our expansion plans in both the market and supply areas of the pipeline network, which includes, among other things, shale gas exploration and development areas, the ability to continue renewing service contracts and continued regulatory stability. Natural gas storage prices have recently been challenged as a result of increasing natural gas supply and narrower seasonal price spreads.\nGas supply and demand dynamics continue to change as a result of the development of non-conventional shale gas supplies. The increase in natural gas supply has resulted in declines in the price of natural gas in North America. As a result, a shift occurred to extraction of gas in richer, wet\u201d gas areas with higher NGL content which depressed activity in dry\u201d fields like the Fayetteville Shale formation where our Ozark assets are located. This, in turn, contributed to a resulting over-supply of pipeline take-away capacity in these areas. As the balance of supply and demand evolves, we expect activity in these areas to push prices higher. However, should supply and demand not come into balance, our businesses there may be subject to possible impairment. The supply increase has also had a negative impact on the seasonal price spreads historically seen between the summer and winter months. The value of storage assets and contracts has declined in recent years, negatively affecting the results of our storage facilities. While we expect storage values to stabilize and strengthen in the future, should these market factors continue to keep downward pressure on the seasonality spread and re-contracting, we could be subject to further reduced value and impairment of our storage assets.\nSpectra Energy Partners also plans to continue earnings growth by maximizing throughput on all sections of the pipeline systems. This entails connecting, where possible, to downstream pipelines, rail or barge terminals to extend the market reach of the pipeline to refinery-customers beyond the end of the pipeline. This also includes optimizing pipeline and storage operations and expanding terminal operations where appropriate.\nFuture earnings growth will be dependent on the success in renewing existing contracts or in securing new supply and market for all pipelines. This will require ongoing increases in supply of crude oil and continued access to attractive markets.\nOur businesses in the U.S. and Canada are subject to laws and regulations on the federal, state and provincial levels. Regulations applicable to the natural gas transmission, crude oil transportation and storage industries have a significant effect on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate. Changes to regulations are ongoing and we cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that any future changes will have on our businesses.\nFERC's current policy permits pipelines and storage companies to include a tax allowance in the cost-of-service used as the basis for calculating their regulated rates. For pipelines and storage companies owned by partnerships or limited liability company interests, the current tax allowance policy reflects the actual or potential income tax liability on the FERC jurisdictional income attributable to all partnership or limited liability company interests if the ultimate owner of the interest has an actual or potential income tax liability on such income. On December 15, 2016, FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry requesting energy industry input on how the FERC should address income tax allowances in cost-based rates proposed by pipeline companies organized as part of a master limited partnership. This Notice of Inquiry was issued in response to a remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in United Airlines v. FERC, in which the court determined that FERC had not justified its conclusion that an oil pipeline organized as a partnership would not double recover\u201d its taxes under the current policy by both including a tax allowance in its cost-based rates and earning a return on equity calculated on a pre-tax basis. We cannot predict whether the FERC will successfully justify its conclusion that there is no double recovery of taxes under these circumstances or whether the FERC will modify its current policy on either income tax allowances or return on equity calculations for pipeline companies organized as part of a master limited partnership. However, any modification that reduces or eliminates an income tax allowance for pipeline companies organized as a part of a master limited partnership or decreases the return on equity for such pipelines could result in an adverse impact on our revenues associated with the transportation and storage services we provide pursuant to cost-based rates. We believe any changes would be prospective from the date of any FERC determination for our regulated entities. Some entities have authority to charge market-based rates and therefore this tax allowance issue does not affect the rates that they charge their customers.\nThese laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. Environmental laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties. In particular, compliance with major Clean Air Act regulatory programs may cause us to incur significant capital expenditures to obtain permits, evaluate offsite impacts of our operations, install pollution control equipment, and otherwise assure compliance.\nOur interstate pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety regulations administered by PHMSA of the DOT. These laws and regulations require us to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of our interstate pipelines.\nPHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. In this climate of increasingly stringent regulation, pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in a reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on our pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have an adverse effect on our operations, earnings, financial condition or cash flows. Additionally, PHMSA issued an interim final rule, effective January 2017, that addresses safety issues related to underground natural gas storage facilities. We believe our existing storage facilities conform to the majority of the requirements of the new rule.\nIn light of the changing environmental and safety laws and regulations described above, we are evaluating efforts required to maintain compliance with such laws and regulations and, in addition, are assessing ways to improve overall system integrity, efficiency and reliability. The capital costs to effectively modernize our pipelines accordingly will be substantial and will be incurred over several years.\nDistribution \n____________\n (a) Trillion British thermal units.  2016 Compared to 2015\nOperating Revenues.

Operating, Maintenance and Other. The $48 million decrease was driven by a $57 million decrease resulting from a lower Canadian dollar.\nMatters Affecting Future Distribution Results\nDistribution plans to continue to expand the Dawn to Parkway transmission system in response to increased customer demand to access new supplies at Dawn. This expansion will consist of a compressor station and associated facilities, and will lead to increased earnings. We expect that the long-term demand for natural gas in Ontario will remain relatively stable with continued growth in peak-day demand, subject to the impacts of future governmental actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some modest growth driven by low natural gas prices is expected to continue with specific interest coming from communities that are not currently serviced by natural gas, given the significant price advantage relative to their alternative energy options.\nNatural gas storage prices have recently been compressed as a result of increasing natural gas supply and narrower seasonal price spreads. Gas supply and demand dynamics continue to change as a result of the development of new unconventional shale gas supplies. These market factors will continue to affect Union Gas' unregulated storage and regulated transportation revenues in the near term. Going forward, Union Gas expects continued improvement in unregulated storage values.\nDuring the past several years, the Canadian dollar has fluctuated compared to the U.S. dollar, which affected earnings to varying degrees. Changes in the exchange rate or any other factors are difficult to predict and may affect future results.\nWestern Canada Transmission & Processing\n\n2016 Compared to 2015\nOperating Revenues. The $265 million decrease was driven by:\n \u2022 a $106 million decrease due to the sale of Empress, \n \u2022 a $66 million decrease in firm gathering and processing revenues, \n \u2022 a $45 million decrease resulting from a lower Canadian dollar, \n \u2022 a $37 million decrease arising from changes in non-cash mark-to-market commodity-related pricing adjustments associated with the risk management program at Empress and \n \u2022 a $23 million decrease due to lower NGL prices.  Natural Gas and Petroleum Products Purchased. The $125 million decrease was driven by:\n \u2022 a $92 million decrease due to the sale of Empress, \n \u2022 a $24 million decrease primarily as a result of lower costs of NGL sales and \n \u2022 a $6 million decrease resulting from a lower Canadian dollar.

Operating, Maintenance and Other. The $74 million decrease was driven by:\n \u2022 a $91 million decrease resulting from a lower Canadian dollar and \n \u2022 an $18 million decrease primarily in costs passed through to customers at M&N Canada, partially offset by \n \u2022 an $18 million increase due to overhead reduction costs and \n \u2022 a $7 million non-cash asset impairment loss related to a natural gas processing plant.  Matters Affecting Future Western Canada Transmission & Processing Results\nWestern Canada Transmission & Processing plans to continue earnings growth through capital efficient supply push\u201d and demand pull\u201d initiatives. Supply push\u201d growth projects are associated with gathering and processing expansions and incremental transportation capacity to support drilling activity in northern BC. Sizable growth in production is being driven by the application of new drilling technologies to unconventional gas reservoirs, with current growth heaviest in the southern and northern sections of the Montney play. Demand pull\u201d growth projects are associated with both small and large scale LNG exports as well as new natural gas-fired electricity generation, methanol, and fertilizer plants in BC and the Pacific Northwest. Prolific nearby gas supplies and favorable international market access have made gas focused projects in BC and the U.S. Pacific Northwest very attractive. Earnings can fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing of processing plant turnarounds that reduce revenues while a plant is out of service and increase operating costs as a result of the turnaround maintenance work. Western Canada Transmission & Processing's processing plants are generally scheduled for turnaround work every three to four years, with the work being staggered to prevent significant outages at any given time in a single geographic area. Future earnings will also be affected by the ability to renew service contracts and regulatory stability. Earnings from processing services will be affected by the ability to access additional natural gas reserves.\nDuring the past several years, the Canadian dollar has fluctuated compared to the U.S. dollar, which affected earnings to varying degrees for brief periods. Changes in the exchange rate are difficult to predict and may affect future results.\nIn certain areas of Western Canada Transmission & Processing's operations, lower natural gas prices resulting from increasing North American gas production have reduced producer demand for both expansions of the BC gas processing plants as well as renewals of existing gas processing contracts, and could continue to do so as long as gas prices remain below historical norms.\nField Services \n____________\n (a) Reflects 100% of volumes. \n (b) Trillion British thermal units per day. \n (c) Average price based on NYMEX Henry Hub. \n (d) Million British thermal units. \n (e) Does not reflect results of commodity hedges. \n (f) Average price based on NYMEX calendar month.  2016 Compared to 2015\nEBITDA increased $421 million mainly as the result of the following variances, each representing our 50% ownership portion of the earnings drivers at DCP Midstream:\n \u2022 a $400 million increase primarily as a result of the 2015 goodwill and other asset impairments, net of tax impacts, \n \u2022 an $88 million increase in gathering and processing margins primarily as a result of asset growth and favorable contract realignments, \n \u2022 a $45 million increase primarily as a result of a producer settlement, \n \u2022 a $24 million increase due to favorable results from ownership interests in NGL pipelines, partially offset by unfavorable results from wholesale propane and \n \u2022 a $19 million increase primarily attributable to lower operating expenses as a result of cost savings initiatives in operations, net of additional costs from asset growth, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $55 million decrease primarily as a result of the expiration of hedges in the first quarter of 2016, \n \u2022 a $35 million decrease resulting from increased net income attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily as a result of asset growth and prior year impairments, \n \u2022 a $20 million decrease from income taxes primarily as a result of a conversion of a taxable entity to a limited liability company and \n \u2022 a $15 million decrease from commodity-sensitive processing arrangements, due to decreased crude oil and natural gas prices, partially offset by increased NGL prices.  2015 Compared to 2014\nEBITDA decreased $678 million mainly as the result of the following variances, each representing our 50% ownership portion of the earnings drivers at DCP Midstream:\n \u2022 a $451 million decrease from commodity-sensitive processing arrangements, due to decreased NGL, crude oil and natural gas prices, \n \u2022 a $392 million decrease primarily as a result of goodwill and other asset impairments, net of tax impacts, \n \u2022 a $71 million decrease in gains associated with the issuance of partnership units by DCP Partners in 2015 compared to 2014 and \n \u2022 a $15 million decrease primarily attributable to higher depreciation expense as a result of asset growth, partially offset by \n \u2022 an $87 million increase in gathering and processing margins as a result of asset growth, net of volume declines in certain geographic regions, \n \u2022 an $81 million increase resulting from decreased net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of unrealized derivative activity, goodwill impairment recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 and a greater portion of distributions allocated to the general partner of DCP Partners through our incentive distribution rights, net of asset growth at DCP Partners, \n \u2022 a $36 million increase as a result of favorable results from ownership interests in NGL pipelines, primarily attributable to the ramp-up of the Sand Hills and Front Range pipelines and favorable results from wholesale propane, \n \u2022 a $24 million increase as a result of net gains on sales of assets in 2015, compared to a loss on the sale of an asset in 2014, \n \u2022 a $16 million increase primarily attributable to lower operating expenses as a result of cost savings initiatives, net of additional costs from asset growth and \n \u2022 a $14 million increase as a result of favorable results from third-party derivative instruments used to mitigate a portion of its expected commodity cash flow risk.  Supplemental Data\nBelow is supplemental information for DCP Midstream's operating results (presented at 100%):\n\nMatters Affecting Future Field Services Results\nThe midstream natural gas industry is cyclical, with the operating results of companies in the industry significantly affected by drilling activity, which may be impacted by prevailing commodity prices. DCP Midstream's business has commodity price exposure as a result of being compensated for certain services in the form of commodities rather than cash. Various factors impact both commodity prices and volumes. If commodity prices weaken for a sustained period, DCP Midstream's natural gas throughput and NGL volumes may be impacted, particularly as producers are curtailing or redirecting drilling, which could further reduce DCP Midstream's earnings and cash flows. Drilling activity levels vary by geographic area; DCP Midstream has observed decreases in drilling activity in certain regions, and increases in drilling activity in others.\nA decline in commodity prices has resulted in a decrease in exploration and development activities in certain fields served by DCP Midstream's gas gathering and residue gas and NGL pipeline transportation systems, and DCP Midstream's natural gas processing and treating plants, which could lead to further reduced utilization of these assets. DCP Midstream's long-term view is that commodity prices will be at levels that it believes will support growth in natural gas, condensate and NGL production. DCP Midstream believes that future commodity prices will be influenced by North American supply deliverability, the severity of winter and summer weather, the level of North American production and drilling activity by exploration and production companies and the balance of trade between imports and exports of LNG, NGLs and crude oil.\nNGL prices are impacted by the demand from petrochemical and refining industries and export facilities. The petrochemical industry has been making significant investment in building and expanding facilities to convert chemical plants from a heavier oil-based feedstock to lighter NGL-based feedstocks, including ethane. This increased demand in future years should provide support for the increasing supply of ethane. Prior to those facilities commencing operations ethane prices could remain weak with supply in excess of demand. In addition, export facilities are being expanded and built, which provide support for the increasing supply of NGLs. Although there can be, and has been, volatility in NGL prices, longer term DCP Midstream believes that there will be sufficient demand in NGLs to support increasing supply.\nOther \n2016 Compared to 2015\nEBITDA. The $258 million change was driven by:\n \u2022 $333 million due to the 2015 goodwill impairment charges associated with the Westcoast acquisition in 2002, partially offset by \n \u2022 $38 million due to higher costs primarily related to the merger with Enbridge announced on September 6, 2016, \n \u2022 $25 million due to higher employee benefit costs and \n \u2022 $10 million due to a captive insurance general liability reserve related to the Texas Eastern incident near Delmont, Pennsylvania.  2015 Compared to 2014\nEBITDA. The $326 million change primarily reflects goodwill impairment charges associated with the Westcoast acquisition in 2002.\nMatters Affecting Future Other Results\nFuture results will continue to include operating costs related to corporate and business services we provide for our operations. We will also include the costs associated with the merger with Enbridge and self-insured losses associated with our captive insurance entities and the impact of stock prices changes on benefits expense.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe application of accounting policies and estimates is an important process that continues to evolve as our operations change and accounting guidance is issued. We have identified a number of critical accounting policies and estimates that require the use of significant estimates and judgments.\nWe base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at the time of application. These estimates and judgments may change as time passes and more information becomes available. If estimates are different than the actual amounts recorded, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to take into consideration the new information. We discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates and other significant accounting policies with our Audit Committee.\nRegulatory Accounting\nWe account for certain of our operations under accounting for regulated entities. As a result, we record assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under generally accepted accounting principles for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers or for instances where the regulator provides current rates that are intended to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future. We continually assess whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities. Based on this assessment, we believe our existing regulatory assets, which primarily relate to the future collection of deferred income tax costs for our Canadian regulated operations, are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state, provincial and federal levels, and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, regulatory asset write-offs would be required. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of regulatory assets. Total regulatory assets were $1,551\nmillion as of December 31, 2016 and $1,397 million as of December 31, 2015. Total regulatory liabilities were $434 million as of December 31, 2016 and $385 million as of December 31, 2015.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nWe had goodwill balances of $4,181 million at December 31, 2016 and $4,154 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in goodwill in 2016 was the result of foreign currency translation.\nAs permitted under accounting guidance on testing goodwill for impairment, we perform either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative assessment of each of our reporting units based on management's judgment. With respect to our qualitative assessments, we consider events and circumstances specific to us, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance, when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts.\nIn connection with our quantitative assessments, we primarily use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine fair values of those reporting units. Key assumptions in the determination of fair value include the use of an appropriate discount rate and estimated future cash flows. In estimating cash flows, we incorporate expected long-term growth rates in key markets served by our operations, regulatory stability, the ability to renew contracts, commodity prices (where appropriate) and foreign currency exchange rates, as well as other factors that affect our reporting units' revenue, expense and capital expenditure projections.\nBased on the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing, no indicators of impairment were noted and the fair values of the reporting units that we assessed at April 1, 2016 (our annual testing date) were in excess of their respective carrying values.\nWe believe the assumptions used in our analyses are appropriate and result in reasonable estimates of the fair values of our reporting units. However, the assumptions used are subject to uncertainty, and declines in the future performance or cash flows of our reporting units, changing business conditions, further sustained declines in commodity prices or increases to our weighted average cost of capital assumptions may result in the recognition of impairment charges, which could be significant.\nNo triggering events have occurred with our reporting units since April 1, 2016 (our annual testing date) that would warrant re-testing for goodwill impairment.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues from the transmission, storage, processing, distribution and sales of natural gas, from the transportation and storage of crude oil, and from the sales of NGLs, are recognized when either the service is provided or the product is delivered. Revenues related to these services provided or products delivered but not yet billed are estimated each month. These estimates are generally based on contract data, regulatory information, estimated distribution usage based on historical data adjusted for heating degree days, commodity prices and preliminary throughput and allocation measurements. Final bills for the current month are billed and collected in the following month. Differences between actual and estimated revenues are immaterial.\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits\nThe calculations of pension and other post-retirement expense and liabilities require the use of numerous assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different reported expense and liability amounts, and future actual demographic and economic outcomes can differ from the assumptions. We believe that the most critical assumptions used in the accounting for pension and other post-retirement benefits are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the assumed discount rate, and the medical and prescription drug cost trend rate assumptions.\nFuture changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension and post-retirement plans will impact future pension expense and funding.\nThe expected return on plan assets is important, as certain of our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are partially funded. Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are developed by using a weighted average of expected returns for each asset class to which the plan assets are allocated. For 2016, the assumed average return was 7.50% for the U.S. pension plan assets, 7.15% for the Canadian pension plan assets and 6.33% for the U.S. other post-retirement benefit assets. A change in the rate of return of 25 basis points for these assets would impact annual benefit expense by approximately $1 million before tax for U.S. plans and by approximately $2 million before tax for Canadian plans. The Canadian other post-retirement benefit plans are not funded.\nSince pension and other post-retirement benefit cost and obligations are measured on a discounted basis, the discount\nrates used to determine the net periodic benefit cost and the benefit obligation are significant assumptions. Discount rates used for our defined benefit and other post-retirement benefit plans are based on the yields constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plans. Discount rates of 4.57% for the U.S. plans and 4.03% for the Canadian plans were used to calculate the 2016 net periodic benefit cost, and represent a weighted average of the applicable rates for all U.S. and Canadian plans, respectively. A 25 basis-point change in the discount rates would impact annual before-tax net periodic benefit cost by approximately $1 million for U.S. plans and $4 million for Canadian plans. Discount rates of 4.10% for the U.S. plans and 3.81% for the Canadian plans were used to calculate the 2016 year-end benefit obligations and represent a weighted average of the applicable rates for all U.S. and Canadian plans, respectively. The weighted average discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation decreased approximately 0.47% for the U.S. plans and approximately 0.22% for the Canadian plans during 2016. The decrease in the benefit obligation discount rate and actuarial experience during 2016 resulted in an increase in benefit obligations at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.\nSee Note 26 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on pension and other post-retirement benefits.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had negative working capital of $2,133 million. This balance includes commercial paper liabilities totaling $1,453 million and current maturities of long-term debt of $551 million. We will rely upon cash flows from operations and various financing transactions, which may include debt and/or equity issuances, to fund our liquidity and capital requirements for 2017. SEP is expected to be self-funding through its cash flows from operations, use of its revolving credit facility and its access to capital markets. We receive cash distributions from SEP in accordance with the partnership agreement, which considers our level of ownership and incentive distribution rights.\nWe have access to five revolving credit facilities, including Spectra Capital's two facilities totaling $3.0 billion, SEP's $2.5 billion facility, Westcoast's 400 million Canadian dollar facility and Union Gas' 700 million Canadian dollar facility, with available capacity of $1.9 billion under SEP's credit facility and $2.9 billion under our other subsidiaries' credit facilities. These facilities are used principally as back-stops for commercial paper programs. At Spectra Capital, SEP and Westcoast, we primarily use commercial paper for temporary funding of capital expenditures. At Union Gas, we primarily use commercial paper for temporary funding of capital expenditures and to support short-term working capital fluctuations. We also utilize commercial paper, other variable-rate debt and interest rate swaps to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable-rate debt. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of available credit facilities and Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity for a discussion of effective shelf registrations.\nOur consolidated capital structure includes commercial paper, long-term debt (including current maturities), preferred stock of subsidiaries and total equity. As of December 31, 2016, our capital structure was 56.4% debt, 25.8% common equity of controlling interests and 17.8% noncontrolling interests and preferred stock of subsidiaries.\nCash flows from operations for our 100%-owned and majority-owned businesses are stable given that approximately 90% of revenues are derived from fee-based services, of which most are regulated. However, total operating cash flows are subject to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, earnings sensitivities to weather, commodity prices, distributions from our equity investments and the timing of cost recoveries pursuant to regulatory approvals. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion.\nCash distributions from our equity investment, DCP Midstream, can fluctuate, mostly as a result of earnings sensitivities to commodity prices, as well as its level of capital expenditures and other investing activities. DCP Midstream funds its operations and investing activities mostly from its operating cash flows, third-party debt and equity transactions associated with DCP Partners. DCP Midstream is required to make quarterly tax distributions to us based on allocated taxable income. In addition to tax distributions, periodic distributions are determined by DCP Midstream's board of directors based on its earnings, operating cash flows and other factors, including capital expenditures and other investing activities, commodity prices outlook and the credit environment. We received no tax or periodic distributions from DCP Midstream during 2016 and 2015. We received total tax and periodic distributions from DCP midstream of $237 million in 2014. These distributions are classified within Cash Flows from Operating Activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We continue to assess the effect of sustained lower commodity prices and other activities at DCP Midstream on cash expected to be received from DCP Midstream and adjust our expansion or other activities as necessary.\nIn addition, cash flows from our Canadian operations are generally used to fund the ongoing Canadian businesses and future Canadian growth. At December 31, 2016, $164 million of Cash and Cash Equivalents was held by our Canadian subsidiaries. Historically, we have reinvested a substantial portion of our Canadian operations' earnings in Canada. Earnings not needed by our Canadian operations have been distributed to Spectra Energy Corp (the U.S. parent) with minimal incremental U.S. tax liability. We anticipate continued substantial reinvestment of our future Canadian earnings in Canada; however, future distributions to Spectra Energy Corp may incur incremental U.S. tax at the U.S. statutory rate without the ability to use foreign tax credits. The timing of when distributions may incur such incremental U.S. tax depends on many factors, such as the amount of future capital expansions in Canada, the tax characterization of our distributions as returns of capital or dividends, the impacts of tax planning on merger and acquisition activities and tax legislation at the time of the distributions.\nAs we execute on our strategic objectives around organic growth and expansion projects, expansion expenditures are expected to approximate $4.6 billion in 2017 and $2.0 billion in 2018, excluding contributions from noncontrolling interests. The timing and extent of these expenditures are likely to vary significantly from year to year, depending mostly on general economic conditions and market requirements. Given that we expect to continue to pursue expansion and earnings growth opportunities over the next several years and also given the scheduled maturities of our existing debt instruments, capital resources will continue to include long-term borrowings and possibly securing additional sources of capital including debt and/or equity securities. We remain committed to maintaining a capital structure and liquidity profile that continue to support an investment-grade credit rating.\nCash Flow Analysis\nThe following table summarizes the changes in cash flows for each of the periods presented:\n\nOperating Cash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $221 million to $2,026 million in 2016 compared to 2015. This change was driven mostly by non-cash goodwill impairments recorded in 2015, offset by higher earnings.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $26 million to $2,247 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This change was driven mostly by changes in working capital, mostly offset by lower earnings.\nInvesting Cash Flows\nNet cash flows used in investing activities increased $1,048 million to $3,830 million in 2016 compared to 2015. This change was driven mostly by:\n \u2022 a $902 million net increase in capital and investment expenditures and \n \u2022 a $396 million distribution received from Gulfstream with proceeds from a Gulfstream debt offering in 2015, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $204 million of proceeds related to the sale of Empress in 2016 and \n \u2022 a $148 million contribution to Gulfstream used to retire debt in 2016, compared to a $248 million contribution in 2015.  Net cash flows used in investing activities increased $779 million to $2,782 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This change was driven mostly by:\n \u2022 a $685 million net increase in capital and investment expenditures and \n \u2022 a $248 million contribution to Gulfstream used to retire debt, partially offset by \n \u2022 a $396 million distribution received from Gulfstream with proceeds from a Gulfstream debt offering in 2015, compared to a $200 million distribution from SESH with proceeds from a SESH debt offering in 2014.  Capital and Investment Expenditures by Business Segment\nCapital and investment expenditures are detailed by business segment in the following table.

Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities increased $1,350 million to $1,890 million in 2016 compared to 2015. This change was driven mostly by:\n \u2022 $879 million of proceeds from the issuance of Spectra Energy's common stock in 2016, \n \u2022 net commercial paper issuances of $319 million in 2016, compared to net commercial paper redemptions of $439 million in 2015 and \n \u2022 $229 million of proceeds from the issuance of Westcoast's preferred stock in 2016, compared to $84 million of proceeds in 2015, partially offset by \n \u2022 $531 million of net proceeds from long-term debt in 2016, compared to net proceeds of $1,300 million in 2015.  Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $540 million in 2015 compared to $199 million used in financing activities in 2014. This $739 million change was driven mostly by:\n \u2022 $1,300 million of net proceeds from long-term debt in 2015, compared to net repayments of long-term debt of $156 million in 2014 and \n \u2022 $546 million proceeds from the issuance of SEP units in 2015, compared to $327 million in 2014, partially offset by \n \u2022 net commercial paper redemptions of $439 million in 2015, compared to net commercial paper issuances of $574 million in 2014.  Significant Financing Activities-2016\nDebt Issuances. The following long-term debt issuances were completed during 2016 as part of our overall financing plan to fund capital expenditures, to refinance maturing debt obligations and for other corporate purposes:\n\n__________________\n (a) U.S. dollar equivalent at time of issuance. \nSpectra Energy Common Stock Issuances. On March 1, 2016, we entered into an equity distribution agreement under which we may sell and issue common stock up to an aggregate offering price of $500 million. The equity distribution agreement allows us to offer and sell common stock at prices deemed appropriate through sales agents. Sales of common stock under the equity distribution agreement will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions through the facilities of the NYSE, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed upon by one or more of the sales agents and us. We intend to use the net proceeds from sales under this at-the-market program for general corporate purposes, including investments in subsidiaries to fund capital expenditures. We issued approximately 12.9 million of common shares to the public under this program, for total net proceeds of $383 million through December 31, 2016.\nIn April 2016, we issued 16.1 million common shares to the public for net proceeds of approximately $479 million. Net proceeds from the offering were used to purchase approximately 10.4 million common units in SEP. SEP used the proceeds from our unit purchase for general corporate purposes, including the funding of its current expansion capital plan.\nSEP Common Unit Issuances. In 2016, SEP issued 12.8 million common units to the public under its at-the-market program and approximately 262,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy. Total net proceeds to SEP were $591 million (net proceeds to Spectra Energy were $579 million). In April 2016, SEP issued 10.4 million common units and 0.2 million general partner units to Spectra Energy in a private placement transaction.\nIn connection with the issuances of the units, a $50 million gain ($31 million net of tax) to Additional Paid-in Capital and a $528 million increase in Equity-Noncontrolling Interests were recorded in 2016. The issuances decreased Spectra Energy's ownership in SEP from 78% to 75% at December 31, 2016.\nIn 2017, SEP has issued 0.5 million common units to the public and approximately 9,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy, for total net proceeds to SEP of $21 million (net proceeds to Spectra Energy were $21 million) through its at-the-market program.\nWestcoast Preferred Stock Issuance. On August 30, 2016, Westcoast issued 12 million Cumulative 5-Year Minimum Rate Reset Redeemable First Preferred Shares, Series 12 for an aggregate principle amount of 300 million Canadian dollars (approximately $229 million as of the issuance date). Net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes.\nSignificant Financing Activities-2015\nDebt Issuances. The following long-term debt issuances were completed during 2015 as part of our overall financing plan to fund capital expenditures, to refinance maturing debt obligations and for other corporate purposes:\n\n__________________\n (a) U.S. dollar equivalent at time of issuance.  SEP Common Unit Issuances. In March 2015, SEP entered into an equity distribution agreement under which it may sell and issue common units up to an aggregate offering price of $500 million, and in December 2015, SEP replaced the equity distribution agreement. The terms of this new equity distribution agreement are substantially similar to those in SEP's previous agreements and allow SEP to sell and issue up to an aggregate offering price of $1 billion of common units. This at-the-market offering program allows SEP to offer and sell its common units, representing limited partner interests, at prices it deems appropriate through a sales agent. Sales of common units, if any, will be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the NYSE, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed to between SEP and the sales agent.\nSEP issued 12.0 million limited partner units to the public in 2015 under its at-the-market program and approximately 245,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy. Total net proceeds to SEP were $557 million (net proceeds to Spectra Energy were $546 million). The net proceeds were used for SEP's general partnership purposes, which may have included debt repayments, capital expenditures and/or additions to working capital.\nWestcoast Preferred Stock Issuance. In December 2015, Westcoast issued 4.6 million Cumulative 5-Year Minimum Rate\nReset Redeemable First Preferred Shares, Series 10 for an aggregate principal amount of 115 million Canadian dollars (approximately $84 million as of the issuance date). Net proceeds from the issuance were used to fund capital expenditures, to refinance maturing debt obligations and for other corporate purposes.\nSignificant Financing Activities-2014\nDebt Issuances. The following long-term debt issuances were completed during 2014:\n\n__________________\n (a) U.S. dollar equivalent at time of issuance.  SEP Common Unit Issuances. SEP issued 6.4 million limited partner units to the public in 2014 under its at-the-market program and approximately 132,000 general partner units to Spectra Energy. Total net proceeds to SEP were $334 million (net proceeds to Spectra Energy were $327 million). The net proceeds were used for SEP's general partnership purposes, which may have included debt repayments, future acquisitions, capital expenditures and/or additions to working capital.\nAvailable Credit Facilities and Restrictive Debt Covenants\n\n__________________\n (a) Revolving credit facilities contain a covenant requiring the Spectra Energy consolidated debt-to-total capitalization ratio, as defined in the agreements, to not exceed 65%. Per the terms of the agreements, collateralized debt is excluded from the calculation of the ratio. This ratio was 56.3% at December 31, 2016. \n (b) Revolving credit facility contains a covenant that requires SEP to maintain a ratio of total Consolidated Indebtedness-to-Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the agreement, of 5.0 to 1 or less. As of December 31, 2016, this ratio was 3.8 to 1. \n (c) U.S. dollar equivalent at December 31, 2016. The revolving credit facility is 400 million Canadian dollars and contains a covenant that requires the Westcoast non-consolidated debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 75%. The ratio was 33.2% at December 31, 2016. \n (d) U.S. dollar equivalent at December 31, 2016. The revolving credit facility is 700 million Canadian dollars and contains a covenant that requires the Union Gas debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 75% and a provision which requires Union Gas to repay all borrowings under the facility for a period of two days during the second quarter of each year. The ratio was 69.0% at December 31, 2016.  On September 29, 2016, we entered into a new one-year, $2 billion credit facility at Spectra Capital, which expires in 2017. Proceeds from borrowings under the credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes. Amounts borrowed under the credit facility must be repaid following any change in control, including any that results from the proposed merger with Enbridge.\nOn April 29, 2016, we amended the Union Gas and SEP revolving credit agreements. The Union Gas revolving credit facility was increased to 700 million Canadian dollars and the SEP revolving facility was increased to $2.5 billion. The expiration of both facilities was extended, with both facilities expiring in 2021.\nOn April 29, 2016, we amended the Westcoast and Spectra Capital revolving credit agreements. The expiration of both credit facilities was extended, with both facilities expiring in 2021.\nThe issuances of commercial paper, letters of credit and revolving borrowings reduce the amounts available under the credit facilities. As of December 31, 2016, there were no letters of credit issued or revolving borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities.\nOur credit agreements contain various covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with those covenants. In addition, our credit agreements allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or in some cases, due to the acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. Our debt and credit agreements do not contain provisions that trigger an acceleration of indebtedness based solely on the occurrence of a material adverse change in our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs noted above, the terms of our Spectra Capital credit agreements require our consolidated debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, as defined in the agreement, to be 65% or lower. Per the terms of the agreement, collateralized debt is excluded from the calculation of the ratio. This ratio was 56.3% at December 31, 2016. Our equity and, as a result, this ratio, is sensitive to significant movements of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar due to the significance of our Canadian operations as discussed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Risk.\u201d Based on the strength of our total capitalization as of December 31, 2016, however, it is not likely that a material adverse effect would occur as a result of a weakened Canadian dollar.\nDividends. Consistent with our near-term objective of increasing our cash dividend by $0.14 per year through 2018, we announced a $0.14 annual dividend increase on January 5, 2017. We expect to continue our policy of paying regular cash dividends. The declaration and payment of dividends are subject to the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the financial condition, earnings and capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain debt obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.44 per common share on January 5, 2017 payable on March 1, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2017.\nOther Financing Matters. Spectra Energy Corp, Spectra Capital and SEP have effective shelf registration statements on file with the SEC to register the issuance of unlimited amounts of various equity and debt securities. SEP also has $359 million available as of December 31, 2016 for the issuance of limited partner common units under another effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC related to its at-the-market program. Westcoast and Union Gas have an aggregate 1.2 billion Canadian dollars (approximately $893 million) available as of December 31, 2016 for the issuance of debt securities in the Canadian market under their medium term note shelf prospectuses, which expired on January 4, 2017.\nOn March 18, 2016, Westcoast filed a new 1 billion Canadian dollar short form base shelf prospectus, which provides for the issuance of first preferred shares. As of the date of this filing, Westcoast has 700 million Canadian dollars (approximately $521 million) available for the issuance of preferred shares under this prospectus, which expires on April 18, 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties. These arrangements include financial guarantees, stand-by letters of credit, debt guarantees, surety bonds and indemnifications. See Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of guarantee arrangements.\nMost of the guarantee arrangements that we enter into enhance the credit standings of certain subsidiaries, non-consolidated entities or less than 100%-owned entities, enabling them to conduct business. As such, these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk which are not included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The possibility of us having to honor our contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of our subsidiaries, investees and other third parties, or the occurrence of certain future events. Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of our operations.\nWe do not have material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures, except for normal operating lease arrangements, guarantee arrangements and financings entered into by DCP Midstream and our other equity investments. For additional information on these commitments, see Notes 21 and 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations\nWe enter into contracts that require payment of cash at certain periods based on certain specified minimum quantities and prices. The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations for each of the periods presented. The table below excludes all amounts classified as Current Liabilities on the December 31, 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet other than Current Maturities of Long-Term Debt. It is expected that the majority of Current Liabilities will be paid in cash in 2017.\nContractual Obligations as of December 31, 2016\n\n__________\n (a) See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts include principal payments and estimated scheduled interest payments over the life of the associated debt and capital lease obligations. \n (b) See Note 21. \n (c) Purchase obligations reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been excluded from the above table. \n (d) Includes firm capacity payments that provide us with uninterrupted firm access to natural gas transportation and storage. \n (e) Includes contractual obligations to purchase physical quantities of natural gas. For contracts where the price paid is based on an index, the amount is based on forward market prices at December 31, 2016. \n (f) Includes contracts for software and consulting or advisory services. Amounts also include contractual obligations for engineering, procurement and construction costs for pipeline projects. Amounts exclude certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand, where the timing of the purchase cannot be determined. \n (g) Includes estimated 2017 retirement plan contributions (see Note 26). We are unable to estimate retirement plan contributions beyond 2017 due primarily to uncertainties about market performance of plan assets. Excludes cash obligations for asset retirement activities (see Note 16) because the amount of cash flows to be paid to settle the asset retirement obligations is not known with certainty as we may use internal or external resources to perform retirement activities. Amounts also exclude reserves for litigation and environmental remediation (see Note 21) and regulatory liabilities (see Note 5) because we are uncertain as to the amount and/or timing of when cash payments will be required. Amounts also exclude deferred income taxes and investment tax credits on the Consolidated Balance Sheet since cash payments for income taxes are determined primarily by taxable income for each discrete fiscal year.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, credit exposure, interest rates, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates. We have established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Our Chief Financial Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing credit risk and commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of NGLs and natural gas purchased as a result of our investment in DCP Midstream and processing associated with certain of our U.S. pipeline assets. Price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of these energy commodities. Our exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including contract size, length, market liquidity, location and unique or specific contract terms.\nDCP Midstream manages its direct exposure to market prices separate from Spectra Energy, and utilizes various risk management strategies, including the use of commodity derivatives.\nWe are exposed to market price fluctuations of NGLs, natural gas and oil in our Field Services segment. Based on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, a 10\u00a2 per-gallon change in NGL prices would affect our annual pre-tax earnings by approximately $25 million in 2017 and $40 million in 2016 for Field Services. For the same periods, a 50\u00a2 per-MMBtu change in natural gas prices would affect our annual pre-tax earnings by approximately $18 million in both periods, and a $10 per-barrel change in oil prices would affect our annual pre-tax earnings by approximately $20 million in both periods.\nThese hypothetical calculations consider estimated production levels, but do not consider other potential effects that might result from such changes in commodity prices. The actual effect of commodity price changes on our earnings could be significantly different than these estimates.\nSee also Notes 1 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. Our principal customers for natural gas transmission, storage, and gathering and processing services are industrial end-users, marketers, exploration and production companies, LDCs and utilities located throughout the U.S. and Canada. Customers on the Express-Platte system are primarily refineries located in the Rocky Mountain and Midwestern states of the U.S. Other customers include oil producers and marketing entities. We have concentrations of receivables from natural gas utilities and their affiliates, industrial customers and marketers throughout these regions, as well as retail distribution customers in Canada. These concentrations of customers may affect our overall credit risk in that risk factors can negatively affect the credit quality of the entire sector. Credit risk associated with gas distribution services are primarily affected by general economic conditions in the service territory.\nWhere exposed to credit risk, we analyze the customers' financial condition prior to entering into an agreement, establish credit limits and monitor the appropriateness of those limits on an ongoing basis. We also obtain parental guarantees, cash deposits or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support, where appropriate, based on our financial analysis of the customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each contract. A significant amount of our credit exposures for transmission, storage, and gathering and processing services are with customers who have an investment-grade rating (or the equivalent based on our evaluation) or are secured by collateral. However, we cannot predict to what extent our business would be impacted by deteriorating conditions in the economy, including possible declines in our customers' creditworthiness.\nBased on our policies for managing credit risk, our current exposures and our credit and other reserves, we do not anticipate a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non-performance by any counterparty.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. We manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable-rate exposures to percentages of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. We also enter into financial derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps and rate lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See also Notes 1, 17 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had interest rate hedges in place for various purposes. We are party to pay floating-receive fixed\u201d interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $2 billion to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt that arise as a result of changes in market interest rates. These swaps also allow us to transform a portion of the underlying interest payments related to our long-term fixed-rate debt securities into variable-rate interest payments in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable-rate debt.\nBased on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2016, it was estimated that if short-term interest rates average 100 basis points higher (lower) in 2017 than in 2016, interest expense, net of offsetting interest income, would fluctuate by $39 million before tax. Comparatively, based on a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2015, had short-term interest rates averaged 100 basis points higher (lower) in 2016 than in 2015, it was estimated that interest expense, net of offsetting interest income, would have fluctuated by approximately $35 million. These amounts were estimated by considering the effect of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate debt outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges, short term investments, and cash and cash equivalents outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur cost of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon, among other things, rates of return on plan assets. These plan assets expose us to price fluctuations in equity markets. In addition, our captive insurance companies maintain various investments to fund certain business risks and losses. Those investments may, from time to time, include investments in equity securities. Volatility of equity markets, particularly declines, will not only impact our cost of providing retirement and postretirement benefits, but will also impact the funding level requirements of those benefits.\nWe manage equity price risk by, among other things, diversifying our investments in equity investments, setting target allocations of investment types, periodically reviewing actual asset allocations and rebalancing allocations if warranted, and utilizing external investment advisors.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk from our Canadian operations. To mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, contracts may be denominated in or indexed to the U.S. dollar and/or local inflation rates, or investments may be naturally hedged through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency.\nTo monitor our currency exchange rate risks, we use sensitivity analysis, which measures the effect of devaluation of the Canadian dollar. An average 10% devaluation in the Canadian dollar exchange rate during 2016 would have resulted in an estimated net loss on the translation of local currency earnings of approximately $22 million on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. In addition, if a 10% devaluation had occurred on December 31, 2016, the Consolidated Balance Sheet would have been negatively impacted by $389 million through a cumulative translation adjustment in AOCI and this devaluation would result in an immaterial impact to our debt-to-total capitalization ratio. At December 31, 2016, one U.S. dollar translated into 1.34 Canadian dollars.\nAs discussed earlier, we maintain credit facilities that typically include financial covenants which limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of total capital for Spectra Energy or of a specific subsidiary. Failure to maintain these covenants could preclude us from issuing commercial paper or letters of credit or borrowing under our revolving credit facilities and could require other affiliates to immediately pay down any outstanding drawn amounts under other revolving credit agreements, which could adversely affect cash flows or restrict business. As a result of the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our consolidated equity, these fluctuations have a direct impact on our ability to maintain certain of these financial covenants.\nOTHER

Key points from the MD&A include:\n\n1. Executive Overview:\n   - 2016 was a successful year with the execution of long-term strategies resulting in meeting customer needs, generating strong earnings and cash flows, executing capital expansion plans, and maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet.\n   - The board approved an increase in quarterly dividend to $0.44 per share.\n   - Net income from controlling interests was $693 million with $1.00 earnings per share compared to $196 million and $0.29 earnings per share in 2015.\n   - Capital investment of $3.9 billion, including $3.3 billion for expansion.\n   - Entered a definitive merger agreement with Enbridge valued at approximately $28 billion.\n   - A detailed strategy is outlined focused on creating value by organic growth, expansions, acquisitions, and connecting markets with growing supply.\n\n2. Results of Operations:\n   - Revenue decreased by $318 million, primarily due to lower revenues from Western Canada Transmission & Processing, and partially offset by higher revenues from Spectra Energy Partners' expansion projects.\n   - Operating expenses decreased by $474 million, with Spectra Energy Partners reporting increased expenses due to pipeline inspection, repair costs, and merger-related costs.\n   - Operating income increased by $126 million from $1,433 million in 2015 to $1,559 million in 2016.\n   - Interest expense decreased by $42 million mainly due to higher capitalized interest and other factors.\n   - The effective tax rate was 17.5% in 2016 compared to 26% in 2015.\n   - Net income-controlling interests was $693 million in 2016 compared to $196 million in 2015.\n\n3. Segment Results:\n   - EBITDA by Business Segment increased for Spectra Energy Partners and decreased for Distribution, Western Canada Transmission & Processing, and Field Services.\n   - For Spectra Energy Partners, income increased due to expansion projects but was partially offset by pipeline inspection and repair costs.\n   - For Distribution, earnings remained flat due to offsetting factors of expansion projects, storage margins, and the effect of a lower Canadian dollar.\n   - For Western Canada Transmission & Processing, earnings decreased mainly due to lower revenues and a lower Canadian dollar.\n   - For Field Services, earnings increased mainly due to impaired goodwill, and higher gathering and processing margins.\n   - The report discusses factors affecting future results for each segment, including market conditions, regulatory changes, and commodity prices.\n\n4. Liquidity and Capital Resources:\n   - Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $221 million to $2,026 million compared to 2015.\n   - Cash used in investing activities increased by $1,048 million to $3,830 million due to higher capital and investment expenditures.\n   - Financing activities provided $1,890 million in cash, including common stock issuances and debt issuances.\n   - Details of debt issuances, dividend increases, financing activities, and off-balance sheet arrangements are provided.\n\n5. Market Risk Disclosures:\n   - The company is exposed to market risks such as commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates, and it employs various risk management strategies to handle these risks.\n\nLastly, new accounting pronouncements are briefly mentioned, noting the reader should refer to Note 1 for a detailed discussion."}
