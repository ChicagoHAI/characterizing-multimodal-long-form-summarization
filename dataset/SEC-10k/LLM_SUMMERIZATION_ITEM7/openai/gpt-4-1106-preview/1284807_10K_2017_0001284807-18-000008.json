MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to clarify the results of our operations, certain changes in our financial position, liquidity, capital structure and business developments for the years covered by the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, the other related information including, but not limited to, the audited consolidated financial statements (including the notes thereto and the independent registered public accounting firm's reports thereon), and the description of our business, all as set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors discussed below and in Item 1A.\nCertain statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d are forward-looking statements.\u201d See Cautionary Statement with Respect to Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d\nGeneral\nWe are a leading manufacturer of exterior building products in North America, operating in two reportable segments: (i) Siding, Fencing, and Stone and (ii) Windows and Doors, which comprised approximately 47% and 53% of our sales, respectively, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. These two segments produce a comprehensive product line of vinyl siding, designer accents, cellular PVC trim, vinyl fencing, vinyl and composite railing, stone veneer and vinyl windows and doors used in both the new construction market and the home repair and remodeling market in the United States and Canada. Vinyl building products have the leading share of sales volume in siding and windows in the United States. We also manufacture vinyl and aluminum soffit and siding accessories, aluminum trim coil, wood windows, aluminum windows, vinyl and aluminum-clad windows and steel and fiberglass doors, enabling us to bundle complementary and color-matched products and accessories with our core products. We believe that our comprehensive product portfolio and geographically diverse, low cost manufacturing platform allow us to better serve our customers and provide us with a competitive advantage over other exterior building products suppliers.\nThe following is a summary of Ply Gem's recent acquisition history:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On September 19, 2014, Ply Gem completed an acquisition for cash consideration of approximately $130.0 million to acquire the capital stock of Fortune Brands Windows, Inc., and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries Simonton Building Products LLC, Simonton Industries, Inc., Simonton Windows, Inc., and SimEx, Inc. Simonton is a premier repair and remodeling window company with leading brand recognition and is part of the Windows and Doors segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On May 29, 2015, Ply Gem acquired substantially all of the assets of Canyon Stone, Inc. ( Canyon Stone\u201d), a manufacturer of stone veneer, for a purchase price of $21.0 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. Canyon Stone is included in our Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrior to January 11, 2010, Ply Gem Holdings was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ply Gem Investment Holdings, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ply Gem Prime. On January 11, 2010, Ply Gem Investment Holdings merged with and into Ply Gem Prime, with Ply Gem Prime being the surviving corporation. In May 2013, the Company issued 18,157,895 shares of common stock in an initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) and received gross proceeds of approximately $381.3 million in the IPO. The shares began trading on The New York Stock Exchange on May 23, 2013 under the symbol \"PGEM\". Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, Ply Gem Prime merged with and into Ply Gem Holdings, with Ply Gem Holdings being the surviving entity. In the merger, all of the preferred stock of Ply Gem Prime (including the subordinated debt of Ply Gem Prime that was converted into preferred stock in connection with the IPO) was converted into a number of shares of the Company's common stock based on the IPO price of the common stock and the liquidation value of and the maximum dividend amount in respect of the preferred stock.\nOn January 31, 2018, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub, each a wholly owned subsidiary of funds sponsored by CD&R. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the Merger\u201d), with Ply Gem Holdings surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the Acquisition\u201d). At the Effective Time, each of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, will be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive $21.64 in cash, without interest (the Merger Consideration\u201d), less any applicable withholding taxes. The consummation of the Merger remains subject to customary closing conditions. As a result of the Merger, we will cease to be a publicly traded company.\nWe are a holding company with no operations or assets of our own other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries. The terms of Ply Gem Industries' $350.0 million ABL Facility and the credit agreement governing the terms of its $430.0 million Term Loan Facility place restrictions on the ability of Ply Gem Industries and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends and otherwise transfer assets to us. Further, the terms of the indenture governing Ply Gem Industries' $650.0 million 6.50% Senior Notes place restrictions on the ability of Ply Gem Industries and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends and otherwise transfer assets to us.\nFinancial statement presentation\nNet sales. Net sales represent the fixed selling price of our products plus certain shipping charges less applicable provisions for discounts and allowances. Allowances include cash discounts, volume rebates and returns among others.\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold includes direct material and manufacturing costs, manufacturing depreciation, third-party and in-house delivery costs and product warranty expense.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG&A expense\u201d) includes all non-product related operating expenses, including selling, marketing, research and development costs, information technology, and other general and administrative expenses.\nOperating earnings (loss). Operating earnings (loss) represents net sales less cost of products sold, SG&A expense, and amortization of intangible assets.\nImpact of commodity pricing\nPVC resin, aluminum, and glass are major components in the production of our products and changes in PVC resin, aluminum, and glass prices have a direct impact on our cost of products sold. Historically, we have been able to pass on a substantial portion of significant price increases to our customers. The results of operations for individual quarters can be negatively impacted by a delay between the time of raw material cost increases and price increases that we implement in our products, or conversely can be positively impacted by a delay between the time of a raw material price decrease and competitive pricing moves that we implement accordingly.\nImpact of weather\nSince our building products are intended for exterior use, our sales and operating earnings tend to be lower during periods of inclement weather. Weather conditions in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year historically result in these quarters producing significantly less sales revenue than our second and third quarters of the year. As a result, we have historically had lower profits or higher losses in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. Our results of operations for individual quarters in the future may be impacted by adverse weather conditions. In addition, favorable or unfavorable weather conditions may influence the comparability of our results from year to year or from quarter to quarter.\nCritical accounting policies\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of judgments in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We periodically evaluate the judgments and estimates used for our critical accounting policies to ensure that such judgments and estimates are reasonable for our interim and year-end reporting requirements. These judgments and estimates are based upon our historical experience, current trends and information available from other sources, as appropriate. If different conditions occur compared to our assumptions and judgments, the results could be materially different from our estimates. Management also believes that the nine areas where different assumptions could result in materially different reported results are (1) goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests, (2) accounts receivable related to the estimation of allowances for doubtful accounts, (3) inventories in estimating reserves for obsolete and excess inventory, (4) warranty reserves, (5) insurance reserves, (6) income taxes including the Tax Receivable Agreement, (7) rebates, (8) pensions, and (9) environmental accruals and other contingencies. Although we believe the likelihood of a material difference in these areas is low based upon our historical experience, a 10% change in our allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory provision estimates, and warranty reserve at December 31, 2017 would result in an approximate $0.3 million, $0.8 million, and $7.7 million impact on expenses, respectively. Additionally, we have included in the discussion that follows our estimation methodology for both accounts receivable and inventories. While all significant policies are important to our consolidated financial statements, some of these policies may be viewed as being critical. Our critical accounting policies include:\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize sales based upon shipment of products to our customers net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances. Generally, the customer takes title upon shipment and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the product. For certain products, it is industry standard that customers take title to products upon delivery, at which time revenue is then recognized by the Company. Revenue includes the selling price of the product and all shipping costs paid by the customer. Revenue is reduced at the time of sale for estimated sales returns and all applicable allowances and discounts based on historical experience. We also provide for estimates of warranty, shipping costs and certain sales-related customer programs at the time of sale. Shipping and warranty costs are included in cost of products sold. Bad debt expense and certain marketing expenses are included in SG&A expense. We believe that our procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are reconciled to the actual amounts. Starting in fiscal 2018, in connection with the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we expect to include additional disaggregated revenue disclosures.\nAccounts Receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of our customers to make required payments, which is provided for in bad debt expense. We determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing our accounts receivable aging and evaluating individual customers' receivables, considering customers' financial condition, credit history and other current economic conditions. If a customer's financial condition was to deteriorate, which might impact its ability to make payment, then additional allowances may be required.\nInventories. Inventories in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We record provisions, as appropriate, to write-down obsolete and excess inventory to estimated net realizable value. The process for evaluating obsolete and excess inventory often requires subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may cause actual results to differ from the estimates at the time such inventory is disposed or sold.\nGoodwill Impairment. We perform an annual test for goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each year (November 25th for 2017) and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may exceed their fair value. We early adopted ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and other (Topic 350) during the year ended December 31, 2017. As such, we measure the goodwill impairment as the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in a reporting unit. We have elected not to utilize the qualitative Step Zero impairment assessment. There was no goodwill impairment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. However, we will continue to evaluate goodwill during future years and future declines in the residential housing and repair and remodeling markets or our market capitalization could result in goodwill impairments.\nTo evaluate goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of reporting units considering such factors as discounted cash flows and valuation multiples for comparable publicly traded companies. A significant reduction in projected sales and earnings which would lead to a reduction in future cash flows could indicate potential impairment.\nA summary of the key assumptions utilized in the goodwill impairment analysis at November 25, 2017, November 26, 2016, and November 28, 2015, as it relates to the fair values and the sensitivities for these assumptions follows:\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 28,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income approach:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated housing starts in terminal year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,049,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminal growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market approach:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Control premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sensitivities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in the terminal year growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase in the discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in the control premium\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of November 25, 2017, we reduced the terminal year estimated housing starts assumption from 1,100,000 in 2016 to 1,049,000 for the 2017 valuation, which reflects a normalized housing start level with an adjustment for potential pullback during the terminal period as the U.S. housing market has been in a growing market for over seven years. We estimate that normalized recurring housing starts will be in a range of 1,000,000 to 1,200,000 to keep up with U.S. population growth according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. We also maintained our terminal growth rate assumption at 3.0% for the three-year period, which is 0.5% lower than the assumption utilized in the Windows and Doors analysis due to Windows and Doors' higher correlation with the new construction market, which provides higher growth levels as we return to a normalized housing market. As of November 25, 2017, we increased Siding, Fencing, and Stone's discount rate by 0.5% to 11.5%, due to the risk associated with the decrease in operating earnings of $10.3 million or 6.6% from higher material costs not fully offset by higher net selling prices despite the net sales increase of $83.3 million achieved during 2017. As of November 26, 2016, we decreased Siding, Fencing, and Stone's discount rate by 0.5% to 11.0%, due to the consistent profitable financial performance demonstrated by Siding, Fencing, and Stone increasing their operating earnings $22.4 million or 16.6% during 2016.\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Windows and Doors\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 28,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income approach:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated housing starts in terminal year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,049,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminal growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market approach:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Control premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sensitivities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in the terminal year growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase in the discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in the control premium\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of November 25, 2017, we reduced the terminal year estimated housing starts assumption from 1,100,000 in 2016 to 1,049,000 for the 2017 valuation, which reflects a normalized housing start level with an adjustment for a potential pullback during the terminal period as the U.S. housing market has been in a growing market for over seven years. As of November 25, 2017, we increased the Windows and Doors' discount rate by 2.0% to 18.0% to account for the risk associated with continuing projected gross margin expansion within the competitive building products industry combined with the risk of a pullback in the terminal year despite the $12.9 million or 29.5% improvement in operating earnings achieved during 2017. As of November 26, 2016, we decreased the Windows and Doors' discount rate by 1.0% to 16.0% as a reflection of the improved operating performance of the Windows and Doors reporting unit which increased their operating earnings $25.4 million or 139.5% during the year ended December 31, 2016 due to improved gross profit margins resulting from higher selling prices and favorable material costs.\nAs of November 25, 2017, we maintained the Windows and Doors' control premium at 10.0%, consistent with the prior year due to the consistent performance of the business achieved during 2017.\nOverall, we utilize the same key assumptions in preparing the prospective financial information ( PFI\u201d) utilized in the discounted cash flow test for the Siding, Fencing, and Stone and Windows and Doors reporting units. However, each reporting unit is impacted differently by industry trends, how market factors are influencing the reporting units' expected performance, competition, and other unique business factors as mentioned above. The Windows and Doors reporting unit has more exposure to the new construction market which experienced depressed housing market conditions during 2009-2011, which ultimately decreased operating performance for this reporting unit. Siding, Fencing, and Stone's performance has been more consistent and profitable resulting in less risk in the PFI.\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 28,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated Windows and Doors reporting unit fair value increase (decrease) in the event of a 10% increase in the weighting of the market multiples method\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated Siding, Fencing, and Stone reporting unit fair value increase (decrease) in the event of a 10% increase in the weighting of the market multiples method\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of November 25, 2017, the discounted cash flow method valuation produced a higher value for both reporting units than the guideline public company method and as such the change to market multiple weighting would reduce the 2017 valuation.\nWe provide no assurance that: (1) valuation multiples will not decline, (2) discount rates will not increase, or (3) the earnings, book values or projected earnings and cash flows of our reporting units will not decline. We will continue to analyze changes to these assumptions in future periods. We will continue to evaluate goodwill during future periods and future declines in the residential housing and remodeling markets could result in future goodwill impairments.\nIncome Taxes. We utilize the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes, which requires that the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the amounts included in our federal, state, and foreign income tax returns be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The amount recorded in our consolidated financial statements reflects estimates of final amounts due to timing of completion and filing of actual income tax returns. Estimates are required with respect to, among other things, the appropriate state income tax rates used in the various states in which we and our subsidiaries are required to file, the potential utilization of operating and capital loss carry-forwards for federal, state, and foreign income tax purposes and valuation allowances required, if any, for tax assets that may not be realized in the future. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, certain positions could be challenged, and the positions may not be fully sustained. We have executed a tax sharing agreement with Ply Gem Holdings and Ply Gem Investment Holdings pursuant to which tax liabilities for each respective party are computed on a stand-alone basis. The tax sharing agreement was amended in 2013 to reflect the merger of Ply Gem Prime Holdings with and into Ply Gem Holdings. Our U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return, unitary, combined, or separate state income tax returns. Gienow Canada and Mitten file separate Canadian income tax returns.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we determined that a valuation allowance was no longer required against our net federal deferred tax assets and a portion of our net state deferred tax assets. As a result, we released approximately $86.5 million of our valuation allowance since positive evidence outweighed negative evidence thereby allowing us to achieve the more likely than not\u201d realization threshold. We still remain in a valuation allowance position at December 31, 2017 against our deferred tax assets for certain state and Canadian jurisdictions as it is currently deemed more likely than not\u201d that the benefit of such net tax assets will not be utilized as the Company continues to be in a three-year cumulative loss position for these states and Canadian jurisdictions. Refer to Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes.\nTax Receivable Agreement ( TRA\u201d) Liability. The TRA liability generally provides for our payment to the Tax Receivable Entity of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in the U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we actually realize in periods ending after the IPO as a result of (i) net operating loss carryovers (\"NOLs\") from periods ending before January 1, 2013, (ii) deductible expenses attributable to the IPO and (iii) deductions related to imputed interest. Since the inception of the TRA liability with the 2013 IPO, we have historically had a full valuation allowance for federal purposes and had partial valuation allowances on certain state and Canadian jurisdictions. As a result of the tax valuation allowance position for federal and state purposes, we historically calculated the TRA liability considering (i) current year taxable income only (due to the uncertainty of future taxable income associated with the Company's previous cumulative loss position) and (ii) future income due to the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we released our discrete valuation allowance on our federal deferred tax assets and certain state deferred tax assets of approximately $55.2 million, due to positive factors outweighing negative evidence thereby allowing us to achieve the more likely than not\u201d realization threshold. The factors surrounding the release of this valuation allowance thereby eliminated any uncertainty as to future taxable income. Consequently, for purposes of calculating the TRA liability, we utilized future forecasts of taxable income beyond the 2016 tax year to determine the TRA liability. Our future taxable income estimate was used to determine the cumulative NOLs that are expected to be utilized and the TRA liability was accordingly adjusted using the 85% TRA rate as we retain the benefit of 15% of the tax savings. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a $69.5 million and $79.7 million liability, respectively, for the amount due pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nASC 740 Income Taxes requires a company to record the effects of a tax law change in the period of enactment. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the recently enacted Tax Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB\u201d) 118 requires that the company include in its financial statements a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimate has been determined. Accordingly, we have performed an earnings and profits analysis associated with the one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result of accumulated losses, there will be no income tax effect recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 based on the reasonable estimate guidance provided by SAB 118. We are continuing to assess the impact from the Tax Act and may record further adjustments in 2018.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes net sales and net income by segment and is derived from the accompanying consolidated statements of operations included in this report.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>970,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>886,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>840,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Windows and Doors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,086,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,024,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>999,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Windows and Doors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,930\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,317\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(954\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Windows and Doors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Windows and Doors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69,333\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72,710\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74,858\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,654\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>688\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on modification or\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,747\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax receivable agreement liability adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60,874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,947\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations based on the amounts and the percentage relationship of the items listed to net sales for the periods indicated. However, our results of operations set forth in the tables below may not necessarily be representative of our future operating results.\nThis review of performance is organized by business segment, reflecting the way we manage our business. Each business group leader is responsible for operating results down to operating earnings (loss). We use operating earnings as a performance measure as it captures the income and expenses within the management control of our business leaders. Corporate management is responsible for making all financing decisions. Therefore, each segment discussion focuses on the factors affecting operating earnings, while interest expense and income taxes and certain other unallocated expenses are separately discussed at the corporate level.\nSiding, Fencing, and Stone Segment\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of operations data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>970,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>886,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>840,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency transaction gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(954\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $83.3 million or 9.4% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The 9.4% net sales increase was driven by a $76.5 million or 9.4% net sales increase for the U.S. market and a net sales increase of $6.8 million or 9.1% for the Canadian market for the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016. In the U.S. market, the 9.4% net sales increase resulted from improved U.S. market demand for our products, new business wins, and higher average selling prices, which increased in response to higher material costs. The favorable U.S. demand factors increased our vinyl siding unit sales by 7.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, our average selling prices increased 0.5% in response to higher material costs resulting in higher net sales of approximately $15.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Overall, we achieved the 9.4% net sales increase in the U.S. market from improved volume, price, and market share gains that were partially offset by inventory buybacks of $2.7 million related to new business wins during the year ended December 31, 2017. In Canada, we achieved the 9.1% net sales increase from increased unit volume sales of 4.6% for our vinyl siding products in Canada and a favorable foreign currency impact of $2.2 million. Our improved net sales in the Canadian market continues to reflect the stabilization in the Canadian market despite the challenging conditions that currently exist in Canada from the significant decline in energy prices that have stymied housing and economic development particularly in Western Canada for the last several years.\nOur building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore, single family housing starts commencing in the period from September 2016 to September 2017 directly impacts the demand for our products for the year ended December 31, 2017. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single family housing starts increased 9.6% during this lag affected period reflecting these improved market conditions. Specifically, the heavy vinyl siding geographic areas in the Northeast increased 3.2% while the Midwest increased 9.4% during the lag affected year. In addition to the new construction market improvement, remodeling activity, according to the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity ( LIRA\u201d), reflected the 2017 fourth quarter trailing twelve months increasing 6.6% compared to 2016. However, due to the relative high dollar value or big ticket\u201d nature of our replacement products, we believe that true remodeling market demand for our big ticket exterior products increased approximately 3.0%. Since our Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment is heavily weighted to the repair and remodeling market, we estimate the weighted average U.S. market increase to be 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, which we exceeded with our 7.0% vinyl siding unit net sales increase in the U.S. for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our 7.0% vinyl siding unit sales increase also exceeded the market indicators as reported by the Vinyl Siding Institute which reported that U.S. vinyl siding industry shipments increased 5.7% during the year. The improved U.S. and Canadian market conditions accounted for the majority of the 9.4% net sales increase achieved during the year ended December 31, 2017, however our sales also benefited from new business wins, which we believe is demonstrated by the improvement in our U.S. market position in vinyl siding, which increased from 39.8% to 40.4% during 2017 relative to 2016, while our share of the Canadian vinyl siding market improved from 31.5% to 32.7% during 2017 relative to 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the percentage of net sales in vinyl siding and metal accessories represented approximately 57.0% and 25.2% and 58.0% and 24.7%, respectively, with our net sales of other products comprising approximately 17.8% and 17.3%, respectively.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $46.7 million or 5.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The net sales increase resulted from a $52.0 million net sales increase or 7.1% in the U.S. market partially offset by a net sales decrease of $5.3 million or 4.9% for the Canadian market. In the U.S. market, the 7.1% net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by improved U.S. market demand for our products, new business wins of approximately $34.0 million, and $11.7 million of net sales attributed to our Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015. Excluding Canyon Stone, our net sales in the U.S. market would have increased 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Our net sales growth in the U.S. market resulted from increased unit sales of approximately 10.6% partially offset by lower average selling prices of approximately 4.4% that were reduced in response to lower raw material input costs experienced during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The lower average selling prices for our products negatively impacted our net sales by approximately $35.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The positive demand factors in the U.S. market were partially offset by continued weaker market demand in Canada which when combined with $3.8 million of negative foreign currency resulted in the $5.3 million Canadian net sales decrease. Market demand in Canada has been negatively impacted by the 2016 decline in energy prices, particularly in Western Canada, where housing starts have declined significantly in Alberta (21.0%).\nOur building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore, single family housing starts commencing in the period from September 2015 to September 2016 directly impacts the demand for our products for the year ended December 31, 2016. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single family housing starts increased 9.0% during this lag affected period reflecting the improved market conditions. In addition to the new construction market improvement, remodeling activity, according to the LIRA, reflected the 2016 trailing twelve months increasing 6.0% compared to the 2015 period. However, due to the relative higher dollar value or big ticket\u201d nature of our replacement products, we believe that true remodeling market demand for our big ticket exterior products increased 3.0% to 4.0%. Since our Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment is heavily weighted to the repair and remodeling market, we estimate the weighted average U.S. market repair and remodeling increase to be 5.4% for 2016. Our U.S. unit sales increase of 10.6% outperformed the estimated market increase but was partially offset by our lower average selling prices. The improvement in single family housing starts and remodeling expenditures as well as our ability to exceed these market indicators on a unit basis is evidenced by the Vinyl Siding Institute reporting that U.S. vinyl siding industry shipments increased 5.2% while shipments in Canada decreased 8.5% for 2016 relative to 2015 compared to our vinyl industry shipments increase of 8.1% in the U.S. and our 4.5% decrease in Canada.\nThe improved U.S. market conditions drove our 5.6% net sales increase during the year ended December 31, 2016; however our sales also benefited from new business wins of $34.0 million which we believe is demonstrated by the improvement in our U.S. market position in vinyl siding which increased from 38.8% to 39.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015, while our share of the Canadian vinyl siding market improved from 30.2% to 31.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $11.2 million or 4.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The gross profit decrease resulted from higher raw material input costs that were not fully offset by increased average selling prices, higher freight costs and the near-term negative impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The increased raw material costs were largely related to aluminum and PVC resin which increased 22.2% and 10.3%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016. This unfavorable material cost pricing decreased gross profit by approximately $28.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016. Although we were able to partially offset this $28.6 million with selling price increases of $15.0 million that were implemented during the first and second quarters of 2017, our realization from the early price increases was below expectations due to timing and market acceptance and, as a result, we announced additional price increases during the second quarter of 2017. These additional price increases are expected to improve gross margins during 2018. While historically we have successfully demonstrated our ability to pass along these material cost increases to customers, which enables our gross margins to remain relatively stable over an annualized period, our gross profit margins may be compressed during periods of rising raw material costs and expand as our selling price increases take effect or material inflation abates. In addition to the higher material costs, we also incurred increased freight expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $5.1 million due to a 15.1% increase in diesel costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 as well as limited experienced drivers and route availability which impacted our common carrier cost, as well as higher operating costs relative to the year ended December 31, 2016 that negatively impacted our gross profit. Furthermore, we incurred unfavorable mix from the $25.6 million increase in metal sales during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, which carry lower gross profit margins than vinyl sales. The negative trends within gross profit were partially offset by improved operating metrics within our Canadian business which experienced higher gross profit of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, which can be attributed to higher average selling prices, improved market conditions within Canada that led to unit volume increases, and favorable foreign currency rates.\nIn addition to the higher material, operating, and freight costs as well as unfavorable product mix, our siding, fencing and stone segment was also negatively impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma by approximately $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Hurricane Harvey's torrential rainfall and flooding of the Houston, Texas area negatively impacted our raw material sourcing with two of the four domestic PVC resin producers declaring force majeure\u201d. In addition, we incurred higher freight charges related to moving our existing supply of PVC resin between our plants because of the temporary PVC resin shortage in the Houston chemical market which supplies a significant percentage of the total U.S. PVC resin market. Since Hurricanes Harvey and Irma occurred on August 24th and September 10th, respectively, the negative impact from these storms commenced during the later portion of our third quarter but permeated into our fourth quarter as well from continued negative raw material pricing, sourcing and freight costs. Overall, our gross profit declined during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 despite volume increases and higher average selling prices as they were fully offset by higher material, freight, and operating costs.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased from 29.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 25.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 370 basis point decrease for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from increased raw material costs primarily for aluminum and PVC resin that were not fully offset during 2017 by increased selling prices. Also, our sales of our metal accessories, which typically carry lower gross profit margins, outpaced our vinyl siding sales, that resulted in a negative product mix impact on our gross profit percentage. In addition, our gross profit margins were unfavorably impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma as well as higher operating and freight costs experienced during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $21.2 million or 8.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The gross profit increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily resulted from the 5.6% net sales increase and included approximately $3.4 million of gross profit from our Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015. Excluding Canyon Stone, our gross profit increase would have been $17.8 million or 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOverall, the higher sales volumes experienced during 2016 in the U.S. market of 5.5% enabled us to increase our operating leverage and gross profit relative to 2015. In addition, we experienced favorable material cost pricing during the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015 specifically for aluminum and PVC resin. This favorable net material cost pricing favorably impacted gross profit by approximately $33.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015, but was offset by $35.2 million of lower net selling prices that were reduced as a result of lower material costs. In addition, our Canadian gross profit declined 12.7% or $4.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $3.0 million as well as the declining Canadian economic conditions prevalent in Western Canada which are heavily dependent on energy prices to sustain their economy partially offset by favorable material costing of $0.9 million.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 28.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 29.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 excluding the impact of the Canyon Stone acquisition. The 90 basis point increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted mainly from improved operating leverage from the 5.6% net sales increase as well as favorable material cost pricing and freight expense partially offset by lower average sales prices, an unfavorable foreign currency impact from a weakening Canadian dollar as well as weakening demand in Canada due to the economic slowdown.\nSG&A Expense\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased from the year ended December 31, 2016 by approximately $2.8 million or 3.2%. The $2.8 million SG&A expense increase resulted from $2.9 million in higher selling and marketing expenses related to the 9.4% net sales increase, $0.9 million in higher legal and professional expenses, $0.7 million in unfavorable workers compensation expenses, $0.2 million in higher research and development expenses, and $0.5 million in increased SG&A expenses for the stone business partially offset by lower management compensation expense of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense decreased 60 basis points from 10.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the lower management compensation expense and improved operating leverage related to the net sales increase.\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased from the year ended December 31, 2015 by approximately $1.1 million or 1.2%. Excluding the impact of the Canyon Stone acquisition which was completed on May 29, 2015 and incurred SG&A expense of approximately $2.6 million, SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $3.7 million or 4.0% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. SG&A expense decreased primarily due to lower sales and marketing spending that resulted from our initiative to better leverage our marketing resources. The success of these initiatives is demonstrated with the SG&A expense reduction while achieving $34.0 million in market share gains during 2016.\nAs a percentage of net sales excluding Canyon Stone, SG&A expense decreased from 10.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 10.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease reflects improved leverage on the fixed component of our SG&A expenses relative to the net sales increase as well as the impact of certain sales and marketing cost initiatives which resulted in our sales and marketing expenses decreasing $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $3.8 million or 29.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to certain customer relationship intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net sales, amortization expense decreased to 0.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 1.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2015 at approximately $12.7 million and 1.4% of net sales relative to $12.9 million and 1.5% of net sales, respectively.\nCurrency Transaction Gain (Loss)\nA currency transaction impact was established in 2013 with the acquisition of Mitten within the Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment. The currency transaction gain for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.3 million. The currency transaction gain for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.2 million and for the year ended December 31, 2015 was a transaction loss of $1.0 million related to the Mitten entity. The $1.2 million increase in the foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to the positive movement in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWindows and Doors Segment\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of operations data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,086,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,024,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>999,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency transaction gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $61.1 million or 6.0% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The 6.0% net sales increase resulted from improved U.S. and Canadian market demand conditions, which primarily favorably impacted our new construction. For the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 our U.S. new construction business increased $54.1 million or 8.3% due in part to higher average selling prices of 2.7% and our U.S. repair and remodeling business decreased $11.4 million or 4.1% from lower unit volume sales of 1.9% partially offset by higher average selling prices of 3.9%. Our Canadian net sales increased $18.4 million or 19.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an improving Western Canadian market which culminated in a unit volume increase of 14.1% and a favorable foreign currency impact of $2.1 million. Our Western Canada sales have been impacted by depressed market conditions that resulted from the significant decline in energy prices that have stymied housing and economic development in Western Canada, however recently we have begun to see some recovery in those markets.\nThe net sales increase for the U.S. market can be attributed to improved market conditions as evidenced by the U.S. Census Bureau reporting that single family housing starts increased 9.6% during the lag effected period which resulted in higher net sales for our new construction business. Our building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore single family starts commencing in the period from September 2016 to September 2017 directly impacts the demand for our products for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the repair and remodeling business, LIRA reported that the 2017 trailing twelve months increased 6.6% compared to the 2016 period creating a favorable demand environment. However, due to the relative high dollar value or big ticket\u201d nature of our replacement products, we believe that true remodeling market demand for our big ticket exterior products increased approximately 3.0%. Our vinyl unit net sales for new construction increased 4.4% which was less than the 9.6% new construction market increase while our repair and remodeling unit sales decreased 1.9% which was lower than the repair and remodeling demand market indicators for the year ended December 31, 2017. The lower unit volumes for new construction relative to market indicators resulted from our ability to realize higher average selling prices on our products combined with aggressive price action taken by certain competitors which suppressed our market gains. The lower unit volumes relative to the overall market for our repair and remodeling window products was caused by acquisition integration activities for certain customers, which adversely impacted unit volumes in certain geographic areas. In addition, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma negatively impacted our ability to ship product to significant markets in Houston and Florida for certain days in late third quarter and early fourth quarter resulting in estimated lost net sales of approximately $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Despite these lower net sales amounts relative to demand market indicators for our new construction and repair and remodeling businesses, we achieved an overall 6.0% net sales increase due in part to higher average selling prices of 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. These higher average selling prices increased our U.S. and Canadian net sales by approximately $30.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $25.4 million or 2.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 can be attributed to the improved U.S. market conditions favorably impacting both our new construction business as well as our repair and remodeling business. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, our new construction business increased $38.7 million or 6.7% while our repair and remodeling business increased $6.1 million or 2.0%. This U.S. net sales increase was partially offset by a $19.4 million net sales decline or 17.0% for our Canadian net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to a weakening Canadian market.\nThe net sales increase for the U.S. market can be attributed to improved market conditions as evidenced by the U.S. Census Bureau reporting that single family housing starts increased 9.0% during the lag effected period which resulted in higher net sales for our new construction products. Our building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore single family starts commencing in the period from September 2015 to September 2016 directly impacts the demand for our products for the year ended December 31, 2016. As previously mentioned, we believe that true market demand for big ticket repair and remodeling products increased 3.0% to 4.0%. Our net sales for new construction and repair and remodeling were lower than the demand market indicators for the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to lower sales in certain geographical areas, namely Texas, specifically Houston, due to extraordinary levels of rainfall which negatively impacted the construction industry and economic conditions in the Houston market related to the oil and gas industry. Our net sales of window products in the Houston market declined $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition to Houston, we incurred lost sales in our repair and remodeling business of $11.3 million and $2.2 million in our new construction business from competitive price action taken by certain competitors in other geographic regions in which we maintained our pricing discipline in the marketplace.\nDespite these lower net sales amounts relative to demand market indicators for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, we achieved higher average selling prices of 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. These higher average selling prices increased our U.S. net sales by approximately $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The overall U.S. net sales increase of $44.8 million was partially offset by a $19.4 million or 17.0% net sales decline for our Western Canadian business which endured challenging market conditions negatively impacted by demand softness due to declining energy prices and poor economic growth as well as a negative foreign currency impact of $3.1 million.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $17.5 or 8.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The gross profit increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from the continued improvement in our new construction business partially offset by declining gross profit performance for our repair and remodeling business within the U.S. while our Canadian business experienced improved gross profit of $5.9 million relative to the prior year period. Gross profit for our U.S. new construction business increased $12.7 million while our repair and remodeling gross profit declined $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The gross profit net improvement for our U.S. businesses was driven by increased selling prices of 3.1%, improved operating efficiencies and favorable product mix, which improved gross profit by $30.8 million partially offset by lower gross margins within our repair and remodeling business which experienced reduced unit volumes during the year decreasing our manufacturing operating leverage. Our Canadian business also experienced favorable pricing of $3.2 million from higher average selling prices for the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016. These factors coupled with improved manufacturing leverage from the unit volume increases and a favorable foreign currency impact of $0.5 million enabled our Canadian business to realize improved gross profit of $5.9 million despite the challenging economic and demand conditions that exist in Western Canada due to lower energy prices. For the Windows and Doors segment, we achieved higher average selling prices during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 from announced price increases implemented to offset the aforementioned raw material cost increases for aluminum and PVC resin as well as glass costs. These higher material costs negatively impacted our gross profit by approximately $14.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to the higher material costs, we also incurred increased freight expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $4.0 million due to a 15% increase in diesel costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 as well as limited experienced drivers and route availability which impacted our common carrier cost.\nIn addition to the higher material and freight costs, our gross profit was negatively impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma during the year ended December 31, 2017. We incurred lost sales of approximately $10.0 million with an estimated gross profit of approximately $2.8 million from the hurricanes impacting our significant new construction and repair and remodeling window markets in Florida and Houston as well as higher material costs of approximately $1.1 million and higher freight expenses of approximately $0.6 million from moving our existing supply of PVC resin between our plants because of the temporary shortages in the Houston area. Since Hurricanes Harvey and Irma occurred on August 24th and September 10th, respectively, the negative impact from these storms commenced during the later portion of our third quarter but permeated into our fourth quarter as well from continued negative raw material pricing, sourcing, and freight costs. Overall, our net sales increase of 6.0% achieved through improved market conditions and higher selling prices was mitigated by higher material costs and the negative hurricane impact resulting in a gross profit improvement of 8.6% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 19.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 20.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 50 basis point increase in gross profit reflects improvements of 110 basis points for our U.S. new construction businesses and 190 basis points for our Canadian business partially offset by an 80 basis point deterioration in our repair and remodeling business due to lower operating leverage on reduced unit sales volume. These net gross margin improvements resulted from improved demand levels and higher average selling prices partially offset by rising material costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $21.4 or 11.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The gross profit increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily resulted from the continued improvement in our new construction and repair and remodeling businesses partially offset by the negative impact from lower net sales in Canada. Gross profit for our U.S. new construction and repair and remodeling business increased $16.1 million and $6.9 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The gross profit improvement for our U.S. businesses was driven by increased selling prices of 3.3%, favorable product mix and lower raw material costs and cost savings and synergies that were realized from our Simonton acquisition. These favorable factors were partially offset by higher costs in our U.S. new construction window business related to labor and freight. These overall net gross profit improvements in the U.S. were partially offset by a gross profit decrease of $1.6 million for our Western Canadian business which experienced weaker market demand due to depressed economic conditions including a negative foreign currency impact of $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 18.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 19.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The 170 basis point gross profit increase reflects improvements for both our U.S. new construction and repair and remodeling window businesses from improved demand levels, higher average selling prices, and favorable material costs partially offset by a decrease for our Canadian business driven by the 17.0% net sales decrease which decreased operating leverage during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nSG&A Expense\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $4.6 million or 3.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The $4.6 million SG&A expense increase primarily resulted from increased selling and marketing expenses of $2.0 million related to the net sales increase of 6.0% and higher bad debt expense of $1.3 million. In addition, we experienced a favorable $1.3 million movement for a severance accrual reversal during the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense decreased 30 basis points from 14.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 14.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $3.9 million or 2.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The SG&A expense decrease was attributable primarily to 2015 activity for acquisition integration and restructuring activities related to our repair and remodeling window acquisition which originally occurred in September 2014 as well as combining our Canadian window manufacturing facilities into a single facility. Specifically, our U.S. window repair and remodeling business incurred lower severance expenses of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, our U.S. window businesses experienced $5.0 million in lower management incentive compensation and lower sales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 partially offset by increased legal fees of approximately $2.8 million primarily related to legal settlements completed in December 2016 and January 2017 as well as increased legal expense associated with the 2015 resolution of class action litigation for our new construction business of $3.2 million. Our Canadian window business experienced lower restructuring and integration charges of $2.2 million, as well as lower personnel costs of $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the economic slowdown with lower demand levels as well as integration activities that occurred during 2015 finalizing our combination of our Western Canadian manufacturing facilities into a single location in Alberta.\nAs a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense decreased from 15.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 14.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The 80 basis point decrease primarily resulted from lower severance expense for our U.S. repair and remodeling window business, lower management compensation expense, lower selling and marketing expenses partially offset by increased legal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, our Canadian window business incurred lower restructuring and personnel expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 from integration activities that were incurred during 2015 finalizing our combination our manufacturing operations into a single location in Alberta.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2016 at $12.3 million and 1.1% of net sales and $12.3 million and 1.2% of net sales, respectively. Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2015 at $12.3 million and 1.2% of net sales and $12.4 million and 1.2% of net sales, respectively.\nCurrency Transaction Gain (Loss)\nThe currency transaction gain for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.1 million increasing $1.0 million from a gain of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the fluctuation in the Canadian dollar as compared to the U.S. dollar for 2017. The currency transaction gain for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.1 million increasing $2.3 million from a loss of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the fluctuation in the Canadian dollar as compared to the U.S. dollar for 2016. Our Gienow acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2013, increased our transactional exposure to the Canadian currency. Management continues to evaluate methodologies to effectively hedge this foreign currency risk.\nUnallocated Operating Earnings, Interest, and (Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes Table 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of operations data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,930\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32,141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30,317\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,930\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,317\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69,363\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72,716\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74,863\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax receivable agreement liability adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60,874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,947\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on modification or extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,747\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Provision) benefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46,654\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>688\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating loss/SG&A Expense\nUnallocated SG&A expense includes items which are not directly attributed to or allocated to either of our reporting segments. Such items include legal costs, corporate payroll, and unallocated finance and accounting expenses. The unallocated operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $3.2 million or 10.0% compared to the same period in 2016 due to decreased management incentive compensation of $3.9 million and lower stock compensation expense of $0.6 million partially offset by increased centralization activities of certain functional areas such as research and development ($0.1 million) and marketing ($0.3 million), along with an increase various other professional fees and personnel expenses of ($0.9 million).\nThe unallocated operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $1.8 million or 6.0% compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to increased centralization of certain functional areas such as research and development ($1.0 million), marketing ($1.0 million), and information technology ($0.7 million) along with increased incentive compensation of approximately $0.4 million partially offset by decreases in stock compensation expense of $0.9 million and various other professional fees and personnel expenses of $0.4 million. One element that drove the increased research and development expense within the unallocated segment was the opening of the Insight Center in Durham, NC during 2016, a facility that supports product development and innovation.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by approximately $3.4 million or 4.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the reduction in the Term Loan Facility principal balance year over year. During March, August and November 2016, we made a total of $160.0 million in voluntary payments on the Term Loan Facility and another $40.0 million voluntary payment on the Term Loan Facility was made in November 2017, in addition to our normal quarterly amortization payments of $1.1 million, or $4.3 million annually, which reduced our outstanding borrowings and our annual interest expense.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by approximately $2.1 million or 2.9% compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of the reduction in the Term Loan Facility principal balance year over year and lower average borrowings on the ABL Facility year over year. During 2016, we made $160.0 million of voluntary payments on the Term Loan Facility in addition to our normal quarterly amortization payments of $1.1 million, or $4.3 million annually, which reduced our outstanding borrowings and our annual interest expense.\nInterest income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was consistent with the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nTax receivable agreement liability adjustment\nSince the inception of the TRA liability with the Company's 2013 initial public offering, we have historically been in a full valuation allowance for federal purposes and a partial valuation allowance for certain state and Canadian jurisdictions. As a result of the Company's tax valuation allowance position for federal and state purposes, we historically calculated the TRA liability considering (i) current year taxable income only (due to the uncertainty of future taxable income associated with our previous cumulative loss position) and (ii) future income due to the expected reversals of deferred tax liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we released our federal valuation allowance and a portion of our state valuation allowance for $55.2 million, due to positive factors outweighing negative evidence, specifically no longer being in a cumulative loss position. The factors surrounding the release of this valuation allowance thereby eliminated any uncertainty as to future taxable income. Consequently, we were able to utilize future forecasts of taxable income beyond the 2016 tax year to determine the TRA liability as of December 31, 2016. Our future taxable income estimates were used to determine the cumulative net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\") that are expected to be utilized and the TRA liability was accordingly adjusted using the 85% TRA rate. As a result of including future taxable income beyond 2016, we recognized a $60.9 million adjustment to the TRA liability during the year ended December 31, 2016 bringing the total TRA liability to $79.7 million as of December 31, 2016.\nThe TRA liability as of December 31, 2017 was $69.5 million. This amount represents the originally anticipated TRA liability at the IPO date with approximately $5.2 million remaining to be expensed through operations for state purposes as we remain in a state tax valuation allowance position as of December 31, 2017 for certain states. This remaining liability will be recognized as the state valuation allowances are released in future years. The $10.2 million decrease in the TRA liability for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted primarily from a $10.7 million decrease for the reduction in the future federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% due to the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017, which reduces the value of the NOLs to be utilized in future periods. The $10.7 million was partially offset by $0.5 million of imputed interest accrual related to the 2016 TRA payment.\nThe $47.9 million increase for the TRA liability adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from the $55.2 million discrete federal valuation allowance release along with our ability to utilize future forecasts of taxable income beyond the 2016 tax year to determine the TRA liability as of December 31, 2016, as described above.\nThe $12.9 million TRA liability adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from increases in taxable income estimates resulting from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities as well as increases in our 2015 taxable income compared to the 2014 period. The $115.9 million increase in our 2015 taxable income can be attributed to the following factors (i) the continued U.S. housing recovery which is estimated to have had a 10.0% year over year increase in single family housing starts according to the U.S. Census Bureau, (ii) improvements in the repair and remodeling market evidenced by the 5.6% increase in homeowner improvements during 2015 versus 2014 according to LIRA, (iii) the positive income contributions from our acquisition of Simonton which was completed in September 2014, and (iv) continued improvements in our existing operations specifically for our U.S. windows business which increased its operating earnings by approximately $45.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. All of these items increased our taxable income estimate for the year ended December 31, 2015 and, as a result, our estimate of the TRA liability.\nLoss on modification or extinguishment of debt\nDuring November 2017, we voluntarily paid $40.0 million on the Term Loan Facility to reduce our outstanding indebtedness as allowable under the terms of the agreement governing the Term Loan Facility. We performed an analysis to determine the proper accounting treatment for this voluntary payment by evaluating the change in cash flows and determining that there were no changes in the creditors as a result of the payment. Consequently, we recognized a loss on debt modification or extinguishment of approximately $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisting of the proportionate write off of the related debt issuance costs and debt discount.\nDuring 2016, we voluntarily paid $160.0 million on the Term Loan Facility to reduce our outstanding indebtedness as allowable under the terms of the agreement governing the Term Loan Facility. We performed an analysis to determine the proper accounting treatment for these voluntary payments by evaluating the change in cash flows and determining that there were no changes in the creditors as a result of the payment. Consequently, we recognized a loss on debt modification or extinguishment of approximately $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisting of the proportionate write off of the related debt issuance costs and debt discount.\nIncome taxes\nThe income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $98.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily related to an increase in pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the reversal of the valuation allowance for federal and certain state jurisdictions during the year ended December 31, 2016. The income tax provision of approximately $46.7 million is comprised of $40.7 million of federal tax expense, $6.5 million of state tax expense, and a $0.5 million foreign income tax benefit. Our pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $115.0 million including the $10.7 million Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment compared to pre-tax income of $23.5 million including the $60.9 million Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we remain in a valuation allowance position for certain state and Canadian jurisdictions.\nThe income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to an approximate $52.0 million tax benefit compared to an approximate $0.7 million tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015. The income tax benefit of approximately $52.0 million is comprised of $53.6 million of federal tax benefit, $2.6 million state tax expense, and $1.0 million foreign income tax benefit. The increase in tax benefit is primarily due to the release of the discrete valuation allowance of $55.2 million partially offset by state income tax, remaining valuation allowances, and foreign income taxes. Our pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $23.5 million including the $60.9 million tax receivable agreement liability adjustment compared to pre-tax income of $31.6 million including the $12.9 million tax receivable agreement liability adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, makes broad and complex changes to the Code including, but not limited to, reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations, eliminating the corporate AMT and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized, creating the BEAT, creating a general limitation on deductible interest expense, and changing rules related to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years after December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, as a result of the corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 enacted in the Tax Act, we recorded an expense of $4.3 million due to the re-measurement of the deferred tax assets at the reduced income tax rate which reduced the future benefit we will realize associated with these assets. This expense has been recognized in income taxes within our consolidated statement of operations.\nASC 740 Income Taxes requires a company to record the effects of a tax law change in the period of enactment. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the recently enacted Tax Act, SAB 118 requires that we include in our financial statements a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimate has been determined. Accordingly, we have performed an earnings and profits analysis associated with the one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result of accumulated losses, there will be no income tax effect recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 based on the reasonable estimate guidance provided by SAB 118. We are continuing to assess the impact from the Tax Act and may record further adjustments in 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n2015 Debt Transaction\nOn November 5, 2015, Ply Gem Industries entered into a second amended and restated ABL Facility. Among other things, the second amended and restated ABL Facility: (i) increased the overall facility to $350.0 million, (ii) provided an accordion feature of $50.0 million, and (iii) established the applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility to a range of 1.25% to 2.00% for Eurodollar rate loans, depending on availability. All outstanding loans under the second amended and restated ABL Facility are due and payable in full on November 5, 2020.\nGeneral cash flow movements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents increased to $71.4 million compared to approximately $51.6 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase in cash was driven by a $5.8 million improvement in operating earnings, $5.0 million lower TRA payments and $120.0 million less in voluntary payments on the Term Loan Facility in 2017 versus 2016 partially offset by $43.1 million lower operating cash flow. The improved operating performance was offset by a $38.1 million increase in working capital during the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016. Accounts receivable increased $24.7 million and inventory increased $22.9 million offset by a $9.5 million improvement in trade payables during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016. The approximate $24.7 million accounts receivable increase from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 resulted primarily from the increase in December sales year over year. The net sales for December 2017 were approximately $177.4 million and the net sales for December 2016 were approximately $152.2 million. The approximate $22.9 million inventory increase from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 resulted from higher raw material costs in 2017 combined with higher inventory levels at December 31, 2017 in anticipation of higher sales volumes in 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $57.8 million to $51.6 million as of December 31, 2016.\nOur business is seasonal because inclement weather during the winter months reduces the level of building and remodeling activity in both the home repair and remodeling and the new home construction sectors, especially in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States and Canada. As a result, our liquidity typically increases during the second and third quarters as our borrowing base increases under the ABL Facility reaching a peak early in the fourth quarter, and decreases late in the fourth quarter and throughout the first quarter.\nOur primary cash needs are for working capital, capital expenditures and debt service. Our annual cash interest charges for debt service under the current organizational structure, including the ABL Facility, are estimated to be approximately $54.0 million for fiscal year 2018. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any scheduled debt maturities until 2020. The specific debt instruments and their corresponding terms and due dates are described in the following sections. Our capital expenditures have historically averaged approximately 1.5% to 2.0% of net sales on an annual basis. For the year ending December 31, 2018, we estimate that our capital expenditures will be in a range from 2.00% to 2.25% of net sales. We finance these cash requirements through internally generated cash flow and funds borrowed under Ply Gem Industries' ABL Facility.\nPly Gem's specific cash flow movement for the year ended December 31, 2017 is summarized below:\nCash provided by operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $101.9 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $145.0 million, and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $139.4 million. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was driven by improved housing conditions that drove the 7.6% net sales increase offset by decreases in cash flows related to our working capital increase as a result of the net sales increase, rising commodity costs, and our aggressiveness in taking early pay discounts. These conditions resulted in an unfavorable $38.1 million impact in our primary working capital for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe relative consistency in net cash provided by operating activities between 2016 and 2015 was primarily driven by the $43.2 million increase in net income during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 partially offset by the $40.1 million working capital increase.\nCash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was approximately $37.9 million, $35.8 million, and $54.7 million, respectively. The cash used in investing activities during 2017 was primarily for capital expenditures which were approximately 2.0%, consistent with our historical average. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold a building in Saskatoon, Canada for approximately $2.1 million. The Company moved to another leased facility within the Saskatoon area that more closely aligns with the Company's needs in that area.\nThe cash used in investing activities during 2016 was primarily for capital expenditures on numerous ongoing capital projects across all business segments. Capital expenditures for 2016 were approximately 1.9% of net sales, consistent with our historical average.\nThe cash used in investing activities in 2015 was primarily for the acquisition of Canyon Stone and capital expenditures on various ongoing capital projects. The Canyon Stone acquisition was approximately $21.0 million net of cash acquired. Capital expenditures for 2015 were approximately 1.8% of net sales, consistent with our historical average.\nCash used in financing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $44.3 million, primarily from the $40.0 million voluntary Term Loan Facility payment made in November 2017, the 1.0% principal repayment of $4.3 million required by the Term Loan Facility, and $1.2 million in tax withholding related to employee stock grant issuances. These payments were offset by $1.2 million in cash provided by the exercise of stock options.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $168.2 million, primarily from the three separate voluntary Term Loan Facility payments that totaled $160.0 million and the 1.0% principal repayment of $4.3 million required by the Term Loan Facility and the Tax Receivable Agreement payment of $5.0 million. These payments were offset by $1.1 million in cash provided by the exercise of stock options.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $3.6 million, primarily related to the 1.0% principal repayment of $4.3 million required by the Term Loan Facility and the payment of $1.4 million in debt issuance costs. These payments were offset by $2.2 million in cash provided by the exercise of stock options.\nPly Gem's specific debt instruments and terms are described below:\n6.50% Senior Notes due 2022\nOn January 30, 2014, Ply Gem Industries issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes at par. On September 19, 2014, Ply Gem Industries issued an additional $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes (the \"Senior Tack-on Notes\") at an issue price of 93.25%. Interest accrues at 6.50% per annum and is paid semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The 6.50% Senior Notes will mature on February 1, 2022. At any time on or after February 1, 2017, Ply Gem Industries may redeem the 6.50% Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at declining redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 6.50% Senior Notes plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The effective interest rate for the 6.50% Senior Notes is 8.39% after considering each of the different interest expense components of this instrument, including the coupon payment and the deferred debt issuance costs.\nThe 6.50% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Ply Gem Holdings and all of the wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of Ply Gem Industries (the Guarantors\u201d). The indenture governing the 6.50% Senior Notes contains certain covenants that limit the ability of Ply Gem Industries and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem their stock, make loans and investments, sell assets, incur certain liens, enter into agreements restricting their ability to pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates, and consolidate, merge or sell assets. In particular, Ply Gem Industries and its restricted subsidiaries may not incur additional debt (other than permitted debt (as defined in the indenture) in limited circumstances) unless, after giving effect to such incurrence, the consolidated interest coverage ratio of Ply Gem Industries would be at least 2.00 to 1.00.\nIn the absence of satisfying the consolidated interest coverage ratio test, Ply Gem Industries and its restricted subsidiaries may only incur additional debt under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, debt under credit facilities (as defined in the indenture) (x) in an amount not to exceed the greater of (a) $350.0 million and (b) the borrowing base (as defined in the indenture) and (y) in an amount not to exceed the greater of (A) $575.0 million and (B) the aggregate amount of indebtedness (as defined in the indenture) that that would cause the consolidated secured debt ratio (as defined in the indenture) to be equal to 4.00 to 1.00; purchase money indebtedness in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $35.0 million and (y) 10% of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the indenture) at any one time outstanding; debt of foreign subsidiaries in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $60.0 million and (y) 15% of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the indenture) at any one time outstanding; debt pursuant to a general basket in an aggregate amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the greater of (x) $75.0 million and (y) 20% of consolidated net tangible assets; and the refinancing of debt under certain circumstances.\nOn September 5, 2014, Ply Gem Industries completed an exchange offer with respect to the 6.50% Senior Notes issued in January 2014 to exchange $500.0 million 6.50% Senior Notes registered under the Securities Act for $500.0 million of the issued and outstanding 6.50% Senior Notes. Upon completion of the exchange offer, all $500.0 million of issued and outstanding 6.50% Senior Notes were registered under the Securities Act. On January 23, 2015, Ply Gem Industries completed an exchange offer with respect to the Senior Tack-on Notes issued in September 2014 to exchange $150.0 million Senior Tack-on Notes registered under the Securities Act for $150.0 million of the issued and outstanding Senior Tack-on Notes. Upon completion of the exchange offer, all $150.0 million of issued and outstanding Senior Tack-on Notes were registered under the Securities Act.\nTerm Loan Facility due 2021\nOn January 30, 2014, Ply Gem Industries entered into a credit agreement governing the terms of its $430.0 million Term Loan Facility. Ply Gem Industries originally borrowed $430.0 million under the Term Loan Facility on January 30, 2014, with an original discount of approximately $2.2 million, yielding proceeds of approximately $427.9 million. The Term Loan Facility will mature on January 30, 2021. The Term Loan Facility requires scheduled quarterly payments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.00% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan Facility with the balance due at maturity. Interest on outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility is paid quarterly.\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at Ply Gem Industries' option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the prime rate of the administrative agent under the credit agreement, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (iii) the adjusted LIBO rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00% or (b) a LIBO rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for eurocurrency deposits in dollars for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a 1.00% floor, plus, in each case, an applicable margin of 3.00% for any eurocurrency loan and 2.00% for any alternate base rate loan. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was 4.00%. The effective interest rate for the Term Loan is 8.60% after considering each of the different interest expense components of this instrument, including the coupon payment, the deferred debt issuance costs and the original issue discount.\nThe Term Loan Facility allows Ply Gem Industries to request one or more incremental term loan facilities in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $140.0 million and (y) an amount such that Ply Gem Industries' consolidated senior secured debt ratio (as defined in the credit agreement), on a pro forma basis, does not exceed 3.75 to 1.00, in each case, subject to certain conditions and receipt of commitments by existing or additional financial institutions or institutional lenders.\nThe Term Loan Facility requires Ply Gem Industries to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with: (i) 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% if our consolidated senior secured debt ratio is equal or less than 2.50 to 1.00 but greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and to 0% if our consolidated senior secured debt ratio is equal to or less than 2.00 to 1.00) of our annual excess cash flow (as defined in the credit agreement), to the extent such excess cash flow exceeds $15.0 million, commencing with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015; (ii) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or certain insurance and condemnation proceeds, in each case subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights; and (iii) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain issuances of debt, other than proceeds from debt permitted under the Term Loan Facility. Ply Gem Industries may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Term Loan Facility at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage\u201d costs with respect to LIBOR loans. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's consolidated senior secured debt ratio was 0.66 and as a result no excess cash flow payment under the Term Loan Facility will be required. However, we elected on November 3, 2017 to voluntarily prepay $40.0 million on the Term Loan Facility to reduce our outstanding indebtedness bringing our cumulative voluntary 2016 and 2017 Term Loan Facility payments to $200.0 million as we elected on March 10, 2016 and August 4, 2016 to voluntarily prepay $30.0 million on each date and elected on November 4, 2016 to voluntarily pay an additional $100.0 million on the Term Loan Facility.\nThe Term Loan Facility is secured on a first-priority lien basis by the stock of Ply Gem Industries and by substantially all of the assets (other than the assets securing the obligations under the ABL Facility, which primarily consist of accounts receivable, inventory, cash, deposit accounts, securities accounts, chattel paper, contract rights, instruments, documents related thereto and proceeds of the foregoing) of Ply Gem Industries and the Guarantors that are subsidiaries of Ply Gem Industries and on a second-priority lien basis by the assets that secure the ABL Facility.\nThe Term Loan Facility includes negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, that are substantially the same as the negative covenants in the 6.50% Senior Notes but does not contain any restrictive financial covenants. The Term Loan Facility also restricts the ability of Ply Gem Industries' subsidiaries to enter into agreements restricting their ability to grant liens to secure the Term Loan Facility and contains a restriction on changes in fiscal year.\nSenior Secured Asset Based Revolving Credit Facility due 2020\nOn November 5, 2015, Ply Gem Holdings, Inc., Ply Gem Industries, Inc., Gienow Canada Inc., and Mitten Inc. (together with Gienow, the Canadian Borrowers\u201d) entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement governing the ABL Facility. Among other things, the second amendment and restatement of the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility: (i) increased the overall facility to $350.0 million from $300.0 million, (ii) established an accordion feature of $50.0 million, (iii) reduced the applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility to a range from 1.25% to 2.00% for Eurodollar rate loans, depending on availability, and (iv) extended the maturity until November 5, 2020. Under the ABL Facility, $300.0 million is available to Ply Gem Industries and $50.0 million is available to the Canadian Borrowers. The following summary describes the ABL Facility after giving effect to the amendment and restatement. As a result of the ABL Facility amendment in which the loan syndication consisted of previous members who either maintained or increased their position as well as new syndication members, the Company capitalized new debt issuance costs of $1.5 million and amortizes these costs through 2020.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at Ply Gem Industries' option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the corporate base rate of the administrative agent under the ABL Facility and (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (b) a Eurodollar rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, in each case plus an applicable margin. The initial applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility was 0.50% for base rate loans and 1.50% for Eurodollar rate loans. The applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility is subject to step ups and step downs based on average excess availability under the ABL Facility. Swingline loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the base rate plus the applicable margin.\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the ABL Facility, Ply Gem Industries is required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder, which fee will be determined based on utilization of the ABL Facility (increasing when utilization is low and decreasing when utilization is high) multiplied by a commitment fee rate determined by reference to average excess availability under the ABL Facility. The commitment fee rate during any fiscal quarter is 0.375% when average excess availability is greater than $100.0 million for the preceding fiscal quarter and 0.25% when average availability is less than or equal to $100.0 million for the preceding fiscal quarter. Ply Gem Industries must also pay customary letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin on Eurodollar loans and agency fees. As of December 31, 2017, our interest rate on the ABL Facility was approximately 2.56%. The ABL Facility requires that if (a) excess availability is less than the greater of (x) 10.0% of the lower of the borrowing base and the aggregate commitments and (y) $25.0 million or (b) any event of default has occurred and is continuing, Ply Gem Industries must comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test of 1.0 to 1.0. If the excess availability under the ABL Facility is less than the greater of (a) 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the aggregate commitments and (b) $30.0 million ($27.5 million for the months of January, February, March and April) for a period of 5 consecutive days or an event of default has occurred and is continuing, all cash from Ply Gem Industries material deposit accounts (including all concentration accounts) will be swept daily into a collection account controlled by the administrative agent under the ABL Facility and used to repay outstanding loans and cash collateralize letters of credit.\nAll obligations under the ABL Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by Ply Gem Holdings and substantially all of Ply Gem Industries' existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. All obligations under the ABL Facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the assets of Ply Gem Industries and the guarantors, including a first-priority security interest in personal property consisting of accounts receivable, inventory, cash, deposit accounts, and certain related assets and proceeds of the foregoing and a second-priority security interest in, and mortgages on, substantially all of Ply Gem Industries' and the Guarantors' material owned real property and equipment and all assets that secure the Term Loan Facility on a first-priority basis. In addition to being secured by the collateral securing the obligations of Ply Gem Industries under the domestic collateral package, the obligations of the Canadian Borrowers, which are borrowers under the Canadian sub-facility under the ABL Facility, are also secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of such Canadian subsidiaries, plus additional mortgages in Canada, and a pledge by Ply Gem Industries of the remaining 35% of the equity interests of the Canadian Borrowers pledged only to secure the Canadian sub-facility.\nThe ABL Facility contains certain covenants that limit Ply Gem Industries' ability and the ability of Ply Gem Industries' subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem their stock, make loans and investments, sell assets, incur certain liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, and consolidate, merge or sell assets.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Ply Gem Industries had approximately $340.3 million of contractual availability and approximately $261.5 million of borrowing base availability under the ABL Facility, reflecting $0.0 million of borrowings outstanding and approximately $9.7 million of letters of credit and priority payables reserves.\nLoss on debt modification or extinguishment\nDuring both March and August 2016, the Company made voluntarily payments of $30.0 million on the Term Loan Facility to reduce its outstanding indebtedness as allowable under the terms of the agreement governing the Term Loan Facility and further elected in November 2016 to voluntarily pay an additional $100.0 million on the Term Loan Facility bringing the cumulative 2016 voluntary payments to $160.0 million. The Company performed an analysis to determine the proper accounting treatment for each of these voluntary payments by evaluating the change in cash flows and determined that there were no changes in creditors as a result of the payments. Consequently, the Company recognized a loss on debt modification in the consolidated statement of operations of approximately $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting the proportionate write-off of the related debt discount ($9.4 million) and debt issuance costs ($2.4 million) associated with the $160.0 million in voluntary payments, as summarized in the table below.\nDuring November 2017, we made a voluntarily payment of $40.0 million on the Term Loan Facility to reduce our outstanding indebtedness as allowable under the terms of the agreement governing the Term Loan Facility. We performed an analysis to determine the proper accounting treatment for each of these voluntary payments by evaluating the change in cash flows and determined that there were no changes in creditors as a result of the payments. Consequently, we recognized a loss on debt modification in the consolidated statement of operations of approximately $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting the proportionate write-off of the related debt discount ($1.7 million) and debt issuance costs ($0.4 million) associated with this $40.0 million voluntary payment, as summarized in the table below.\nBased on these financing transactions, we recognized a loss on debt modification or extinguishment of approximately $2.1 million, $11.7 million and $0.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, as summarized in the table below.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on modification of debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan Facility unamortized discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,681\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,375\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan Facility unamortized debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(425\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,372\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loss on modification or extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,747\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity requirements\nWe intend to fund our ongoing capital and working capital requirements, including our internal growth, through a combination of cash flows from operations and, if necessary, from borrowings under our ABL Facility. We believe that we will continue to meet our liquidity requirements over the next 12 months. We believe that our operating units are positive cash flow generating units and will continue to sustain their operations without any significant liquidity concerns. The performance of these operating units is significantly impacted by the performance of the housing industry, specifically single family housing starts and the repair and remodeling activity. Any unforeseen or unanticipated downturn in the housing industry could have a negative impact on our liquidity position.\nManagement anticipates that our current liquidity position, as well as expected cash flows from our operations should be sufficient to meet ongoing operational cash flow needs, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and other fees payable under other contractual obligations for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $71.4 million, approximately $340.3 million of contractual availability under the ABL Facility and approximately $261.5 million of borrowing base availability.\nIn order to further supplement the Company's operating cash flow, the Company has from time to time opportunistically accessed capital markets based on prevailing economic and financial conditions. Based on market conditions, the Company may elect to pursue additional financing alternatives in the future.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations under financing arrangements and lease commitments, including interest amounts, as of December 31, 2017. Interest on the 6.50% Senior Notes is fixed.

We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the past three fiscal years.\nThe demand for our products is seasonal, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States and Canada where inclement weather conditions during the winter months usually reduces the level of building and remodeling activity in both the home repair and remodeling and the new home construction sectors. Our sales in both segments are usually lower during the first and fourth quarters. Since a portion of our manufacturing overhead and operating expenses are relatively fixed throughout the year, operating income and net earnings tend to be lower in quarters with lower sales levels. In addition, the demand for cash to fund our working capital is greater from late in the fourth quarter through the first quarter.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements, which are hereby incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 7.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to clarify the results of our operations, certain changes in our financial position, liquidity, capital structure and business developments for the years covered by the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, the other related information including, but not limited to, the audited consolidated financial statements (including the notes thereto and the independent registered public accounting firm's reports thereon), and the description of our business, all as set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors discussed below and in Item 1A.\nCertain statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d are forward-looking statements.\u201d See Cautionary Statement with Respect to Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d\nGeneral\nWe are a leading manufacturer of exterior building products in North America, operating in two reportable segments: (i) Siding, Fencing, and Stone and (ii) Windows and Doors, which comprised approximately 47% and 53% of our sales, respectively, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. These two segments produce a comprehensive product line of vinyl siding, designer accents, cellular PVC trim, vinyl fencing, vinyl and composite railing, stone veneer and vinyl windows and doors used in both the new construction market and the home repair and remodeling market in the United States and Canada. Vinyl building products have the leading share of sales volume in siding and windows in the United States. We also manufacture vinyl and aluminum soffit and siding accessories, aluminum trim coil, wood windows, aluminum windows, vinyl and aluminum-clad windows and steel and fiberglass doors, enabling us to bundle complementary and color-matched products and accessories with our core products. We believe that our comprehensive product portfolio and geographically diverse, low cost manufacturing platform allow us to better serve our customers and provide us with a competitive advantage over other exterior building products suppliers.\nThe following is a summary of Ply Gem's recent acquisition history:\n \u2022 On September 19, 2014, Ply Gem completed an acquisition for cash consideration of approximately $130.0 million to acquire the capital stock of Fortune Brands Windows, Inc., and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries Simonton Building Products LLC, Simonton Industries, Inc., Simonton Windows, Inc., and SimEx, Inc. Simonton is a premier repair and remodeling window company with leading brand recognition and is part of the Windows and Doors segment. \n \u2022 On May 29, 2015, Ply Gem acquired substantially all of the assets of Canyon Stone, Inc. ( Canyon Stone\u201d), a manufacturer of stone veneer, for a purchase price of $21.0 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. Canyon Stone is included in our Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment. \nPrior to January 11, 2010, Ply Gem Holdings was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ply Gem Investment Holdings, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ply Gem Prime. On January 11, 2010, Ply Gem Investment Holdings merged with and into Ply Gem Prime, with Ply Gem Prime being the surviving corporation. In May 2013, the Company issued 18,157,895 shares of common stock in an initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) and received gross proceeds of approximately $381.3 million in the IPO. The shares began trading on The New York Stock Exchange on May 23, 2013 under the symbol \"PGEM\". Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, Ply Gem Prime merged with and into Ply Gem Holdings, with Ply Gem Holdings being the surviving entity. In the merger, all of the preferred stock of Ply Gem Prime (including the subordinated debt of Ply Gem Prime that was converted into preferred stock in connection with the IPO) was converted into a number of shares of the Company's common stock based on the IPO price of the common stock and the liquidation value of and the maximum dividend amount in respect of the preferred stock.\nOn January 31, 2018, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub, each a wholly owned subsidiary of funds sponsored by CD&R. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the Merger\u201d), with Ply Gem Holdings surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the Acquisition\u201d). At the Effective Time, each of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, will be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive $21.64 in cash, without interest (the Merger Consideration\u201d), less any applicable withholding taxes. The consummation of the Merger remains subject to customary closing conditions. As a result of the Merger, we will cease to be a publicly traded company.\nWe are a holding company with no operations or assets of our own other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries. The terms of Ply Gem Industries' $350.0 million ABL Facility and the credit agreement governing the terms of its $430.0 million Term Loan Facility place restrictions on the ability of Ply Gem Industries and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends and otherwise transfer assets to us. Further, the terms of the indenture governing Ply Gem Industries' $650.0 million 6.50% Senior Notes place restrictions on the ability of Ply Gem Industries and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends and otherwise transfer assets to us.\nFinancial statement presentation\nNet sales. Net sales represent the fixed selling price of our products plus certain shipping charges less applicable provisions for discounts and allowances. Allowances include cash discounts, volume rebates and returns among others.\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold includes direct material and manufacturing costs, manufacturing depreciation, third-party and in-house delivery costs and product warranty expense.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG&A expense\u201d) includes all non-product related operating expenses, including selling, marketing, research and development costs, information technology, and other general and administrative expenses.\nOperating earnings (loss). Operating earnings (loss) represents net sales less cost of products sold, SG&A expense, and amortization of intangible assets.\nImpact of commodity pricing\nPVC resin, aluminum, and glass are major components in the production of our products and changes in PVC resin, aluminum, and glass prices have a direct impact on our cost of products sold. Historically, we have been able to pass on a substantial portion of significant price increases to our customers. The results of operations for individual quarters can be negatively impacted by a delay between the time of raw material cost increases and price increases that we implement in our products, or conversely can be positively impacted by a delay between the time of a raw material price decrease and competitive pricing moves that we implement accordingly.\nImpact of weather\nSince our building products are intended for exterior use, our sales and operating earnings tend to be lower during periods of inclement weather. Weather conditions in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year historically result in these quarters producing significantly less sales revenue than our second and third quarters of the year. As a result, we have historically had lower profits or higher losses in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. Our results of operations for individual quarters in the future may be impacted by adverse weather conditions. In addition, favorable or unfavorable weather conditions may influence the comparability of our results from year to year or from quarter to quarter.\nCritical accounting policies\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of judgments in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We periodically evaluate the judgments and estimates used for our critical accounting policies to ensure that such judgments and estimates are reasonable for our interim and year-end reporting requirements. These judgments and estimates are based upon our historical experience, current trends and information available from other sources, as appropriate. If different conditions occur compared to our assumptions and judgments, the results could be materially different from our estimates. Management also believes that the nine areas where different assumptions could result in materially different reported results are (1) goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests, (2) accounts receivable related to the estimation of allowances for doubtful accounts, (3) inventories in estimating reserves for obsolete and excess inventory, (4) warranty reserves, (5) insurance reserves, (6) income taxes including the Tax Receivable Agreement, (7) rebates, (8) pensions, and (9) environmental accruals and other contingencies. Although we believe the likelihood of a material difference in these areas is low based upon our historical experience, a 10% change in our allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory provision estimates, and warranty reserve at December 31, 2017 would result in an approximate $0.3 million, $0.8 million, and $7.7 million impact on expenses, respectively. Additionally, we have included in the discussion that follows our estimation methodology for both accounts receivable and inventories. While all significant policies are important to our consolidated financial statements, some of these policies may be viewed as being critical. Our critical accounting policies include:\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize sales based upon shipment of products to our customers net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances. Generally, the customer takes title upon shipment and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the product. For certain products, it is industry standard that customers take title to products upon delivery, at which time revenue is then recognized by the Company. Revenue includes the selling price of the product and all shipping costs paid by the customer. Revenue is reduced at the time of sale for estimated sales returns and all applicable allowances and discounts based on historical experience. We also provide for estimates of warranty, shipping costs and certain sales-related customer programs at the time of sale. Shipping and warranty costs are included in cost of products sold. Bad debt expense and certain marketing expenses are included in SG&A expense. We believe that our procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are reconciled to the actual amounts. Starting in fiscal 2018, in connection with the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we expect to include additional disaggregated revenue disclosures.\nAccounts Receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of our customers to make required payments, which is provided for in bad debt expense. We determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing our accounts receivable aging and evaluating individual customers' receivables, considering customers' financial condition, credit history and other current economic conditions. If a customer's financial condition was to deteriorate, which might impact its ability to make payment, then additional allowances may be required.\nInventories. Inventories in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We record provisions, as appropriate, to write-down obsolete and excess inventory to estimated net realizable value. The process for evaluating obsolete and excess inventory often requires subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may cause actual results to differ from the estimates at the time such inventory is disposed or sold.\nGoodwill Impairment. We perform an annual test for goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each year (November 25th for 2017) and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may exceed their fair value. We early adopted ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and other (Topic 350) during the year ended December 31, 2017. As such, we measure the goodwill impairment as the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in a reporting unit. We have elected not to utilize the qualitative Step Zero impairment assessment. There was no goodwill impairment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. However, we will continue to evaluate goodwill during future years and future declines in the residential housing and repair and remodeling markets or our market capitalization could result in goodwill impairments.\nTo evaluate goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of reporting units considering such factors as discounted cash flows and valuation multiples for comparable publicly traded companies. A significant reduction in projected sales and earnings which would lead to a reduction in future cash flows could indicate potential impairment.\nA summary of the key assumptions utilized in the goodwill impairment analysis at November 25, 2017, November 26, 2016, and November 28, 2015, as it relates to the fair values and the sensitivities for these assumptions follows:\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 28,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income approach:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated housing starts in terminal year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,049,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminal growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market approach:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Control premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sensitivities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in the terminal year growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase in the discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>203,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in the control premium\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of November 25, 2017, we reduced the terminal year estimated housing starts assumption from 1,100,000 in 2016 to 1,049,000 for the 2017 valuation, which reflects a normalized housing start level with an adjustment for potential pullback during the terminal period as the U.S. housing market has been in a growing market for over seven years. We estimate that normalized recurring housing starts will be in a range of 1,000,000 to 1,200,000 to keep up with U.S. population growth according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. We also maintained our terminal growth rate assumption at 3.0% for the three-year period, which is 0.5% lower than the assumption utilized in the Windows and Doors analysis due to Windows and Doors' higher correlation with the new construction market, which provides higher growth levels as we return to a normalized housing market. As of November 25, 2017, we increased Siding, Fencing, and Stone's discount rate by 0.5% to 11.5%, due to the risk associated with the decrease in operating earnings of $10.3 million or 6.6% from higher material costs not fully offset by higher net selling prices despite the net sales increase of $83.3 million achieved during 2017. As of November 26, 2016, we decreased Siding, Fencing, and Stone's discount rate by 0.5% to 11.0%, due to the consistent profitable financial performance demonstrated by Siding, Fencing, and Stone increasing their operating earnings $22.4 million or 16.6% during 2016.\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Windows and Doors\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 28,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income approach:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated housing starts in terminal year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,049,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminal growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market approach:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Control premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sensitivities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in the terminal year growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase in the discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in the control premium\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of November 25, 2017, we reduced the terminal year estimated housing starts assumption from 1,100,000 in 2016 to 1,049,000 for the 2017 valuation, which reflects a normalized housing start level with an adjustment for a potential pullback during the terminal period as the U.S. housing market has been in a growing market for over seven years. As of November 25, 2017, we increased the Windows and Doors' discount rate by 2.0% to 18.0% to account for the risk associated with continuing projected gross margin expansion within the competitive building products industry combined with the risk of a pullback in the terminal year despite the $12.9 million or 29.5% improvement in operating earnings achieved during 2017. As of November 26, 2016, we decreased the Windows and Doors' discount rate by 1.0% to 16.0% as a reflection of the improved operating performance of the Windows and Doors reporting unit which increased their operating earnings $25.4 million or 139.5% during the year ended December 31, 2016 due to improved gross profit margins resulting from higher selling prices and favorable material costs.\nAs of November 25, 2017, we maintained the Windows and Doors' control premium at 10.0%, consistent with the prior year due to the consistent performance of the business achieved during 2017.\nOverall, we utilize the same key assumptions in preparing the prospective financial information ( PFI\u201d) utilized in the discounted cash flow test for the Siding, Fencing, and Stone and Windows and Doors reporting units. However, each reporting unit is impacted differently by industry trends, how market factors are influencing the reporting units' expected performance, competition, and other unique business factors as mentioned above. The Windows and Doors reporting unit has more exposure to the new construction market which experienced depressed housing market conditions during 2009-2011, which ultimately decreased operating performance for this reporting unit. Siding, Fencing, and Stone's performance has been more consistent and profitable resulting in less risk in the PFI.\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 28,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated Windows and Doors reporting unit fair value increase (decrease) in the event of a 10% increase in the weighting of the market multiples method\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated Siding, Fencing, and Stone reporting unit fair value increase (decrease) in the event of a 10% increase in the weighting of the market multiples method\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,000\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of November 25, 2017, the discounted cash flow method valuation produced a higher value for both reporting units than the guideline public company method and as such the change to market multiple weighting would reduce the 2017 valuation.\nWe provide no assurance that: (1) valuation multiples will not decline, (2) discount rates will not increase, or (3) the earnings, book values or projected earnings and cash flows of our reporting units will not decline. We will continue to analyze changes to these assumptions in future periods. We will continue to evaluate goodwill during future periods and future declines in the residential housing and remodeling markets could result in future goodwill impairments.\nIncome Taxes. We utilize the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes, which requires that the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the amounts included in our federal, state, and foreign income tax returns be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The amount recorded in our consolidated financial statements reflects estimates of final amounts due to timing of completion and filing of actual income tax returns. Estimates are required with respect to, among other things, the appropriate state income tax rates used in the various states in which we and our subsidiaries are required to file, the potential utilization of operating and capital loss carry-forwards for federal, state, and foreign income tax purposes and valuation allowances required, if any, for tax assets that may not be realized in the future. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, certain positions could be challenged, and the positions may not be fully sustained. We have executed a tax sharing agreement with Ply Gem Holdings and Ply Gem Investment Holdings pursuant to which tax liabilities for each respective party are computed on a stand-alone basis. The tax sharing agreement was amended in 2013 to reflect the merger of Ply Gem Prime Holdings with and into Ply Gem Holdings. Our U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return, unitary, combined, or separate state income tax returns. Gienow Canada and Mitten file separate Canadian income tax returns.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we determined that a valuation allowance was no longer required against our net federal deferred tax assets and a portion of our net state deferred tax assets. As a result, we released approximately $86.5 million of our valuation allowance since positive evidence outweighed negative evidence thereby allowing us to achieve the more likely than not\u201d realization threshold. We still remain in a valuation allowance position at December 31, 2017 against our deferred tax assets for certain state and Canadian jurisdictions as it is currently deemed more likely than not\u201d that the benefit of such net tax assets will not be utilized as the Company continues to be in a three-year cumulative loss position for these states and Canadian jurisdictions. Refer to Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes.\nTax Receivable Agreement ( TRA\u201d) Liability. The TRA liability generally provides for our payment to the Tax Receivable Entity of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in the U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we actually realize in periods ending after the IPO as a result of (i) net operating loss carryovers (\"NOLs\") from periods ending before January 1, 2013, (ii) deductible expenses attributable to the IPO and (iii) deductions related to imputed interest. Since the inception of the TRA liability with the 2013 IPO, we have historically had a full valuation allowance for federal purposes and had partial valuation allowances on certain state and Canadian jurisdictions. As a result of the tax valuation allowance position for federal and state purposes, we historically calculated the TRA liability considering (i) current year taxable income only (due to the uncertainty of future taxable income associated with the Company's previous cumulative loss position) and (ii) future income due to the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we released our discrete valuation allowance on our federal deferred tax assets and certain state deferred tax assets of approximately $55.2 million, due to positive factors outweighing negative evidence thereby allowing us to achieve the more likely than not\u201d realization threshold. The factors surrounding the release of this valuation allowance thereby eliminated any uncertainty as to future taxable income. Consequently, for purposes of calculating the TRA liability, we utilized future forecasts of taxable income beyond the 2016 tax year to determine the TRA liability. Our future taxable income estimate was used to determine the cumulative NOLs that are expected to be utilized and the TRA liability was accordingly adjusted using the 85% TRA rate as we retain the benefit of 15% of the tax savings. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a $69.5 million and $79.7 million liability, respectively, for the amount due pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nASC 740 Income Taxes requires a company to record the effects of a tax law change in the period of enactment. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the recently enacted Tax Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB\u201d) 118 requires that the company include in its financial statements a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimate has been determined. Accordingly, we have performed an earnings and profits analysis associated with the one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result of accumulated losses, there will be no income tax effect recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 based on the reasonable estimate guidance provided by SAB 118. We are continuing to assess the impact from the Tax Act and may record further adjustments in 2018.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes net sales and net income by segment and is derived from the accompanying consolidated statements of operations included in this report.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>970,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>886,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>840,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Windows and Doors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,086,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,024,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>999,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Windows and Doors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,930\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,317\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(954\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Windows and Doors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Windows and Doors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69,333\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72,710\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74,858\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,654\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>688\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on modification or\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,747\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax receivable agreement liability adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60,874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,947\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations based on the amounts and the percentage relationship of the items listed to net sales for the periods indicated. However, our results of operations set forth in the tables below may not necessarily be representative of our future operating results.\nThis review of performance is organized by business segment, reflecting the way we manage our business. Each business group leader is responsible for operating results down to operating earnings (loss). We use operating earnings as a performance measure as it captures the income and expenses within the management control of our business leaders. Corporate management is responsible for making all financing decisions. Therefore, each segment discussion focuses on the factors affecting operating earnings, while interest expense and income taxes and certain other unallocated expenses are separately discussed at the corporate level.\nSiding, Fencing, and Stone Segment\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of operations data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>970,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>886,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>840,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>248,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency transaction gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(954\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $83.3 million or 9.4% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The 9.4% net sales increase was driven by a $76.5 million or 9.4% net sales increase for the U.S. market and a net sales increase of $6.8 million or 9.1% for the Canadian market for the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016. In the U.S. market, the 9.4% net sales increase resulted from improved U.S. market demand for our products, new business wins, and higher average selling prices, which increased in response to higher material costs. The favorable U.S. demand factors increased our vinyl siding unit sales by 7.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, our average selling prices increased 0.5% in response to higher material costs resulting in higher net sales of approximately $15.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Overall, we achieved the 9.4% net sales increase in the U.S. market from improved volume, price, and market share gains that were partially offset by inventory buybacks of $2.7 million related to new business wins during the year ended December 31, 2017. In Canada, we achieved the 9.1% net sales increase from increased unit volume sales of 4.6% for our vinyl siding products in Canada and a favorable foreign currency impact of $2.2 million. Our improved net sales in the Canadian market continues to reflect the stabilization in the Canadian market despite the challenging conditions that currently exist in Canada from the significant decline in energy prices that have stymied housing and economic development particularly in Western Canada for the last several years.\nOur building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore, single family housing starts commencing in the period from September 2016 to September 2017 directly impacts the demand for our products for the year ended December 31, 2017. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single family housing starts increased 9.6% during this lag affected period reflecting these improved market conditions. Specifically, the heavy vinyl siding geographic areas in the Northeast increased 3.2% while the Midwest increased 9.4% during the lag affected year. In addition to the new construction market improvement, remodeling activity, according to the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity ( LIRA\u201d), reflected the 2017 fourth quarter trailing twelve months increasing 6.6% compared to 2016. However, due to the relative high dollar value or big ticket\u201d nature of our replacement products, we believe that true remodeling market demand for our big ticket exterior products increased approximately 3.0%. Since our Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment is heavily weighted to the repair and remodeling market, we estimate the weighted average U.S. market increase to be 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, which we exceeded with our 7.0% vinyl siding unit net sales increase in the U.S. for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our 7.0% vinyl siding unit sales increase also exceeded the market indicators as reported by the Vinyl Siding Institute which reported that U.S. vinyl siding industry shipments increased 5.7% during the year. The improved U.S. and Canadian market conditions accounted for the majority of the 9.4% net sales increase achieved during the year ended December 31, 2017, however our sales also benefited from new business wins, which we believe is demonstrated by the improvement in our U.S. market position in vinyl siding, which increased from 39.8% to 40.4% during 2017 relative to 2016, while our share of the Canadian vinyl siding market improved from 31.5% to 32.7% during 2017 relative to 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the percentage of net sales in vinyl siding and metal accessories represented approximately 57.0% and 25.2% and 58.0% and 24.7%, respectively, with our net sales of other products comprising approximately 17.8% and 17.3%, respectively.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $46.7 million or 5.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The net sales increase resulted from a $52.0 million net sales increase or 7.1% in the U.S. market partially offset by a net sales decrease of $5.3 million or 4.9% for the Canadian market. In the U.S. market, the 7.1% net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by improved U.S. market demand for our products, new business wins of approximately $34.0 million, and $11.7 million of net sales attributed to our Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015. Excluding Canyon Stone, our net sales in the U.S. market would have increased 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Our net sales growth in the U.S. market resulted from increased unit sales of approximately 10.6% partially offset by lower average selling prices of approximately 4.4% that were reduced in response to lower raw material input costs experienced during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The lower average selling prices for our products negatively impacted our net sales by approximately $35.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The positive demand factors in the U.S. market were partially offset by continued weaker market demand in Canada which when combined with $3.8 million of negative foreign currency resulted in the $5.3 million Canadian net sales decrease. Market demand in Canada has been negatively impacted by the 2016 decline in energy prices, particularly in Western Canada, where housing starts have declined significantly in Alberta (21.0%).\nOur building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore, single family housing starts commencing in the period from September 2015 to September 2016 directly impacts the demand for our products for the year ended December 31, 2016. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single family housing starts increased 9.0% during this lag affected period reflecting the improved market conditions. In addition to the new construction market improvement, remodeling activity, according to the LIRA, reflected the 2016 trailing twelve months increasing 6.0% compared to the 2015 period. However, due to the relative higher dollar value or big ticket\u201d nature of our replacement products, we believe that true remodeling market demand for our big ticket exterior products increased 3.0% to 4.0%. Since our Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment is heavily weighted to the repair and remodeling market, we estimate the weighted average U.S. market repair and remodeling increase to be 5.4% for 2016. Our U.S. unit sales increase of 10.6% outperformed the estimated market increase but was partially offset by our lower average selling prices. The improvement in single family housing starts and remodeling expenditures as well as our ability to exceed these market indicators on a unit basis is evidenced by the Vinyl Siding Institute reporting that U.S. vinyl siding industry shipments increased 5.2% while shipments in Canada decreased 8.5% for 2016 relative to 2015 compared to our vinyl industry shipments increase of 8.1% in the U.S. and our 4.5% decrease in Canada.\nThe improved U.S. market conditions drove our 5.6% net sales increase during the year ended December 31, 2016; however our sales also benefited from new business wins of $34.0 million which we believe is demonstrated by the improvement in our U.S. market position in vinyl siding which increased from 38.8% to 39.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015, while our share of the Canadian vinyl siding market improved from 30.2% to 31.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $11.2 million or 4.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The gross profit decrease resulted from higher raw material input costs that were not fully offset by increased average selling prices, higher freight costs and the near-term negative impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The increased raw material costs were largely related to aluminum and PVC resin which increased 22.2% and 10.3%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016. This unfavorable material cost pricing decreased gross profit by approximately $28.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016. Although we were able to partially offset this $28.6 million with selling price increases of $15.0 million that were implemented during the first and second quarters of 2017, our realization from the early price increases was below expectations due to timing and market acceptance and, as a result, we announced additional price increases during the second quarter of 2017. These additional price increases are expected to improve gross margins during 2018. While historically we have successfully demonstrated our ability to pass along these material cost increases to customers, which enables our gross margins to remain relatively stable over an annualized period, our gross profit margins may be compressed during periods of rising raw material costs and expand as our selling price increases take effect or material inflation abates. In addition to the higher material costs, we also incurred increased freight expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $5.1 million due to a 15.1% increase in diesel costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 as well as limited experienced drivers and route availability which impacted our common carrier cost, as well as higher operating costs relative to the year ended December 31, 2016 that negatively impacted our gross profit. Furthermore, we incurred unfavorable mix from the $25.6 million increase in metal sales during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, which carry lower gross profit margins than vinyl sales. The negative trends within gross profit were partially offset by improved operating metrics within our Canadian business which experienced higher gross profit of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, which can be attributed to higher average selling prices, improved market conditions within Canada that led to unit volume increases, and favorable foreign currency rates.\nIn addition to the higher material, operating, and freight costs as well as unfavorable product mix, our siding, fencing and stone segment was also negatively impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma by approximately $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Hurricane Harvey's torrential rainfall and flooding of the Houston, Texas area negatively impacted our raw material sourcing with two of the four domestic PVC resin producers declaring force majeure\u201d. In addition, we incurred higher freight charges related to moving our existing supply of PVC resin between our plants because of the temporary PVC resin shortage in the Houston chemical market which supplies a significant percentage of the total U.S. PVC resin market. Since Hurricanes Harvey and Irma occurred on August 24th and September 10th, respectively, the negative impact from these storms commenced during the later portion of our third quarter but permeated into our fourth quarter as well from continued negative raw material pricing, sourcing and freight costs. Overall, our gross profit declined during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 despite volume increases and higher average selling prices as they were fully offset by higher material, freight, and operating costs.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased from 29.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 25.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 370 basis point decrease for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from increased raw material costs primarily for aluminum and PVC resin that were not fully offset during 2017 by increased selling prices. Also, our sales of our metal accessories, which typically carry lower gross profit margins, outpaced our vinyl siding sales, that resulted in a negative product mix impact on our gross profit percentage. In addition, our gross profit margins were unfavorably impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma as well as higher operating and freight costs experienced during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $21.2 million or 8.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The gross profit increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily resulted from the 5.6% net sales increase and included approximately $3.4 million of gross profit from our Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015. Excluding Canyon Stone, our gross profit increase would have been $17.8 million or 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOverall, the higher sales volumes experienced during 2016 in the U.S. market of 5.5% enabled us to increase our operating leverage and gross profit relative to 2015. In addition, we experienced favorable material cost pricing during the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015 specifically for aluminum and PVC resin. This favorable net material cost pricing favorably impacted gross profit by approximately $33.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015, but was offset by $35.2 million of lower net selling prices that were reduced as a result of lower material costs. In addition, our Canadian gross profit declined 12.7% or $4.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $3.0 million as well as the declining Canadian economic conditions prevalent in Western Canada which are heavily dependent on energy prices to sustain their economy partially offset by favorable material costing of $0.9 million.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 28.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 29.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 excluding the impact of the Canyon Stone acquisition. The 90 basis point increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted mainly from improved operating leverage from the 5.6% net sales increase as well as favorable material cost pricing and freight expense partially offset by lower average sales prices, an unfavorable foreign currency impact from a weakening Canadian dollar as well as weakening demand in Canada due to the economic slowdown.\nSG&A Expense\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased from the year ended December 31, 2016 by approximately $2.8 million or 3.2%. The $2.8 million SG&A expense increase resulted from $2.9 million in higher selling and marketing expenses related to the 9.4% net sales increase, $0.9 million in higher legal and professional expenses, $0.7 million in unfavorable workers compensation expenses, $0.2 million in higher research and development expenses, and $0.5 million in increased SG&A expenses for the stone business partially offset by lower management compensation expense of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense decreased 60 basis points from 10.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the lower management compensation expense and improved operating leverage related to the net sales increase.\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased from the year ended December 31, 2015 by approximately $1.1 million or 1.2%. Excluding the impact of the Canyon Stone acquisition which was completed on May 29, 2015 and incurred SG&A expense of approximately $2.6 million, SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $3.7 million or 4.0% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. SG&A expense decreased primarily due to lower sales and marketing spending that resulted from our initiative to better leverage our marketing resources. The success of these initiatives is demonstrated with the SG&A expense reduction while achieving $34.0 million in market share gains during 2016.\nAs a percentage of net sales excluding Canyon Stone, SG&A expense decreased from 10.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 10.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease reflects improved leverage on the fixed component of our SG&A expenses relative to the net sales increase as well as the impact of certain sales and marketing cost initiatives which resulted in our sales and marketing expenses decreasing $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $3.8 million or 29.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to certain customer relationship intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net sales, amortization expense decreased to 0.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 1.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2015 at approximately $12.7 million and 1.4% of net sales relative to $12.9 million and 1.5% of net sales, respectively.\nCurrency Transaction Gain (Loss)\nA currency transaction impact was established in 2013 with the acquisition of Mitten within the Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment. The currency transaction gain for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.3 million. The currency transaction gain for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.2 million and for the year ended December 31, 2015 was a transaction loss of $1.0 million related to the Mitten entity. The $1.2 million increase in the foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to the positive movement in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWindows and Doors Segment\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of operations data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,086,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,024,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>999,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>220,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency transaction gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $61.1 million or 6.0% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The 6.0% net sales increase resulted from improved U.S. and Canadian market demand conditions, which primarily favorably impacted our new construction. For the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 our U.S. new construction business increased $54.1 million or 8.3% due in part to higher average selling prices of 2.7% and our U.S. repair and remodeling business decreased $11.4 million or 4.1% from lower unit volume sales of 1.9% partially offset by higher average selling prices of 3.9%. Our Canadian net sales increased $18.4 million or 19.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an improving Western Canadian market which culminated in a unit volume increase of 14.1% and a favorable foreign currency impact of $2.1 million. Our Western Canada sales have been impacted by depressed market conditions that resulted from the significant decline in energy prices that have stymied housing and economic development in Western Canada, however recently we have begun to see some recovery in those markets.\nThe net sales increase for the U.S. market can be attributed to improved market conditions as evidenced by the U.S. Census Bureau reporting that single family housing starts increased 9.6% during the lag effected period which resulted in higher net sales for our new construction business. Our building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore single family starts commencing in the period from September 2016 to September 2017 directly impacts the demand for our products for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the repair and remodeling business, LIRA reported that the 2017 trailing twelve months increased 6.6% compared to the 2016 period creating a favorable demand environment. However, due to the relative high dollar value or big ticket\u201d nature of our replacement products, we believe that true remodeling market demand for our big ticket exterior products increased approximately 3.0%. Our vinyl unit net sales for new construction increased 4.4% which was less than the 9.6% new construction market increase while our repair and remodeling unit sales decreased 1.9% which was lower than the repair and remodeling demand market indicators for the year ended December 31, 2017. The lower unit volumes for new construction relative to market indicators resulted from our ability to realize higher average selling prices on our products combined with aggressive price action taken by certain competitors which suppressed our market gains. The lower unit volumes relative to the overall market for our repair and remodeling window products was caused by acquisition integration activities for certain customers, which adversely impacted unit volumes in certain geographic areas. In addition, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma negatively impacted our ability to ship product to significant markets in Houston and Florida for certain days in late third quarter and early fourth quarter resulting in estimated lost net sales of approximately $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Despite these lower net sales amounts relative to demand market indicators for our new construction and repair and remodeling businesses, we achieved an overall 6.0% net sales increase due in part to higher average selling prices of 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. These higher average selling prices increased our U.S. and Canadian net sales by approximately $30.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $25.4 million or 2.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 can be attributed to the improved U.S. market conditions favorably impacting both our new construction business as well as our repair and remodeling business. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, our new construction business increased $38.7 million or 6.7% while our repair and remodeling business increased $6.1 million or 2.0%. This U.S. net sales increase was partially offset by a $19.4 million net sales decline or 17.0% for our Canadian net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to a weakening Canadian market.\nThe net sales increase for the U.S. market can be attributed to improved market conditions as evidenced by the U.S. Census Bureau reporting that single family housing starts increased 9.0% during the lag effected period which resulted in higher net sales for our new construction products. Our building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore single family starts commencing in the period from September 2015 to September 2016 directly impacts the demand for our products for the year ended December 31, 2016. As previously mentioned, we believe that true market demand for big ticket repair and remodeling products increased 3.0% to 4.0%. Our net sales for new construction and repair and remodeling were lower than the demand market indicators for the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to lower sales in certain geographical areas, namely Texas, specifically Houston, due to extraordinary levels of rainfall which negatively impacted the construction industry and economic conditions in the Houston market related to the oil and gas industry. Our net sales of window products in the Houston market declined $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition to Houston, we incurred lost sales in our repair and remodeling business of $11.3 million and $2.2 million in our new construction business from competitive price action taken by certain competitors in other geographic regions in which we maintained our pricing discipline in the marketplace.\nDespite these lower net sales amounts relative to demand market indicators for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, we achieved higher average selling prices of 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. These higher average selling prices increased our U.S. net sales by approximately $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The overall U.S. net sales increase of $44.8 million was partially offset by a $19.4 million or 17.0% net sales decline for our Western Canadian business which endured challenging market conditions negatively impacted by demand softness due to declining energy prices and poor economic growth as well as a negative foreign currency impact of $3.1 million.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $17.5 or 8.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The gross profit increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from the continued improvement in our new construction business partially offset by declining gross profit performance for our repair and remodeling business within the U.S. while our Canadian business experienced improved gross profit of $5.9 million relative to the prior year period. Gross profit for our U.S. new construction business increased $12.7 million while our repair and remodeling gross profit declined $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The gross profit net improvement for our U.S. businesses was driven by increased selling prices of 3.1%, improved operating efficiencies and favorable product mix, which improved gross profit by $30.8 million partially offset by lower gross margins within our repair and remodeling business which experienced reduced unit volumes during the year decreasing our manufacturing operating leverage. Our Canadian business also experienced favorable pricing of $3.2 million from higher average selling prices for the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016. These factors coupled with improved manufacturing leverage from the unit volume increases and a favorable foreign currency impact of $0.5 million enabled our Canadian business to realize improved gross profit of $5.9 million despite the challenging economic and demand conditions that exist in Western Canada due to lower energy prices. For the Windows and Doors segment, we achieved higher average selling prices during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 from announced price increases implemented to offset the aforementioned raw material cost increases for aluminum and PVC resin as well as glass costs. These higher material costs negatively impacted our gross profit by approximately $14.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to the higher material costs, we also incurred increased freight expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $4.0 million due to a 15% increase in diesel costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 as well as limited experienced drivers and route availability which impacted our common carrier cost.\nIn addition to the higher material and freight costs, our gross profit was negatively impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma during the year ended December 31, 2017. We incurred lost sales of approximately $10.0 million with an estimated gross profit of approximately $2.8 million from the hurricanes impacting our significant new construction and repair and remodeling window markets in Florida and Houston as well as higher material costs of approximately $1.1 million and higher freight expenses of approximately $0.6 million from moving our existing supply of PVC resin between our plants because of the temporary shortages in the Houston area. Since Hurricanes Harvey and Irma occurred on August 24th and September 10th, respectively, the negative impact from these storms commenced during the later portion of our third quarter but permeated into our fourth quarter as well from continued negative raw material pricing, sourcing, and freight costs. Overall, our net sales increase of 6.0% achieved through improved market conditions and higher selling prices was mitigated by higher material costs and the negative hurricane impact resulting in a gross profit improvement of 8.6% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 19.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 20.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 50 basis point increase in gross profit reflects improvements of 110 basis points for our U.S. new construction businesses and 190 basis points for our Canadian business partially offset by an 80 basis point deterioration in our repair and remodeling business due to lower operating leverage on reduced unit sales volume. These net gross margin improvements resulted from improved demand levels and higher average selling prices partially offset by rising material costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $21.4 or 11.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The gross profit increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily resulted from the continued improvement in our new construction and repair and remodeling businesses partially offset by the negative impact from lower net sales in Canada. Gross profit for our U.S. new construction and repair and remodeling business increased $16.1 million and $6.9 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The gross profit improvement for our U.S. businesses was driven by increased selling prices of 3.3%, favorable product mix and lower raw material costs and cost savings and synergies that were realized from our Simonton acquisition. These favorable factors were partially offset by higher costs in our U.S. new construction window business related to labor and freight. These overall net gross profit improvements in the U.S. were partially offset by a gross profit decrease of $1.6 million for our Western Canadian business which experienced weaker market demand due to depressed economic conditions including a negative foreign currency impact of $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 18.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 19.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The 170 basis point gross profit increase reflects improvements for both our U.S. new construction and repair and remodeling window businesses from improved demand levels, higher average selling prices, and favorable material costs partially offset by a decrease for our Canadian business driven by the 17.0% net sales decrease which decreased operating leverage during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nSG&A Expense\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $4.6 million or 3.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The $4.6 million SG&A expense increase primarily resulted from increased selling and marketing expenses of $2.0 million related to the net sales increase of 6.0% and higher bad debt expense of $1.3 million. In addition, we experienced a favorable $1.3 million movement for a severance accrual reversal during the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense decreased 30 basis points from 14.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 14.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $3.9 million or 2.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The SG&A expense decrease was attributable primarily to 2015 activity for acquisition integration and restructuring activities related to our repair and remodeling window acquisition which originally occurred in September 2014 as well as combining our Canadian window manufacturing facilities into a single facility. Specifically, our U.S. window repair and remodeling business incurred lower severance expenses of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, our U.S. window businesses experienced $5.0 million in lower management incentive compensation and lower sales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 partially offset by increased legal fees of approximately $2.8 million primarily related to legal settlements completed in December 2016 and January 2017 as well as increased legal expense associated with the 2015 resolution of class action litigation for our new construction business of $3.2 million. Our Canadian window business experienced lower restructuring and integration charges of $2.2 million, as well as lower personnel costs of $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the economic slowdown with lower demand levels as well as integration activities that occurred during 2015 finalizing our combination of our Western Canadian manufacturing facilities into a single location in Alberta.\nAs a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense decreased from 15.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 14.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The 80 basis point decrease primarily resulted from lower severance expense for our U.S. repair and remodeling window business, lower management compensation expense, lower selling and marketing expenses partially offset by increased legal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, our Canadian window business incurred lower restructuring and personnel expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 from integration activities that were incurred during 2015 finalizing our combination our manufacturing operations into a single location in Alberta.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2016 at $12.3 million and 1.1% of net sales and $12.3 million and 1.2% of net sales, respectively. Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2015 at $12.3 million and 1.2% of net sales and $12.4 million and 1.2% of net sales, respectively.\nCurrency Transaction Gain (Loss)\nThe currency transaction gain for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.1 million increasing $1.0 million from a gain of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the fluctuation in the Canadian dollar as compared to the U.S. dollar for 2017. The currency transaction gain for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.1 million increasing $2.3 million from a loss of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the fluctuation in the Canadian dollar as compared to the U.S. dollar for 2016. Our Gienow acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2013, increased our transactional exposure to the Canadian currency. Management continues to evaluate methodologies to effectively hedge this foreign currency risk.\nUnallocated Operating Earnings, Interest, and (Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes Table 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of operations data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,930\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(32,141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30,317\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,930\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,317\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69,363\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72,716\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74,863\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax receivable agreement liability adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(60,874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,947\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on modification or extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,747\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Provision) benefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(46,654\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>688\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating loss/SG&A Expense\nUnallocated SG&A expense includes items which are not directly attributed to or allocated to either of our reporting segments. Such items include legal costs, corporate payroll, and unallocated finance and accounting expenses. The unallocated operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $3.2 million or 10.0% compared to the same period in 2016 due to decreased management incentive compensation of $3.9 million and lower stock compensation expense of $0.6 million partially offset by increased centralization activities of certain functional areas such as research and development ($0.1 million) and marketing ($0.3 million), along with an increase various other professional fees and personnel expenses of ($0.9 million).\nThe unallocated operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $1.8 million or 6.0% compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to increased centralization of certain functional areas such as research and development ($1.0 million), marketing ($1.0 million), and information technology ($0.7 million) along with increased incentive compensation of approximately $0.4 million partially offset by decreases in stock compensation expense of $0.9 million and various other professional fees and personnel expenses of $0.4 million. One element that drove the increased research and development expense within the unallocated segment was the opening of the Insight Center in Durham, NC during 2016, a facility that supports product development and innovation.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by approximately $3.4 million or 4.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the reduction in the Term Loan Facility principal balance year over year. During March, August and November 2016, we made a total of $160.0 million in voluntary payments on the Term Loan Facility and another $40.0 million voluntary payment on the Term Loan Facility was made in November 2017, in addition to our normal quarterly amortization payments of $1.1 million, or $4.3 million annually, which reduced our outstanding borrowings and our annual interest expense.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by approximately $2.1 million or 2.9% compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of the reduction in the Term Loan Facility principal balance year over year and lower average borrowings on the ABL Facility year over year. During 2016, we made $160.0 million of voluntary payments on the Term Loan Facility in addition to our normal quarterly amortization payments of $1.1 million, or $4.3 million annually, which reduced our outstanding borrowings and our annual interest expense.\nInterest income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was consistent with the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nTax receivable agreement liability adjustment\nSince the inception of the TRA liability with the Company's 2013 initial public offering, we have historically been in a full valuation allowance for federal purposes and a partial valuation allowance for certain state and Canadian jurisdictions. As a result of the Company's tax valuation allowance position for federal and state purposes, we historically calculated the TRA liability considering (i) current year taxable income only (due to the uncertainty of future taxable income associated with our previous cumulative loss position) and (ii) future income due to the expected reversals of deferred tax liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we released our federal valuation allowance and a portion of our state valuation allowance for $55.2 million, due to positive factors outweighing negative evidence, specifically no longer being in a cumulative loss position. The factors surrounding the release of this valuation allowance thereby eliminated any uncertainty as to future taxable income. Consequently, we were able to utilize future forecasts of taxable income beyond the 2016 tax year to determine the TRA liability as of December 31, 2016. Our future taxable income estimates were used to determine the cumulative net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\") that are expected to be utilized and the TRA liability was accordingly adjusted using the 85% TRA rate. As a result of including future taxable income beyond 2016, we recognized a $60.9 million adjustment to the TRA liability during the year ended December 31, 2016 bringing the total TRA liability to $79.7 million as of December 31, 2016.\nThe TRA liability as of December 31, 2017 was $69.5 million. This amount represents the originally anticipated TRA liability at the IPO date with approximately $5.2 million remaining to be expensed through operations for state purposes as we remain in a state tax valuation allowance position as of December 31, 2017 for certain states. This remaining liability will be recognized as the state valuation allowances are released in future years. The $10.2 million decrease in the TRA liability for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted primarily from a $10.7 million decrease for the reduction in the future federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% due to the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017, which reduces the value of the NOLs to be utilized in future periods. The $10.7 million was partially offset by $0.5 million of imputed interest accrual related to the 2016 TRA payment.\nThe $47.9 million increase for the TRA liability adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from the $55.2 million discrete federal valuation allowance release along with our ability to utilize future forecasts of taxable income beyond the 2016 tax year to determine the TRA liability as of December 31, 2016, as described above.\nThe $12.9 million TRA liability adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from increases in taxable income estimates resulting from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities as well as increases in our 2015 taxable income compared to the 2014 period. The $115.9 million increase in our 2015 taxable income can be attributed to the following factors (i) the continued U.S. housing recovery which is estimated to have had a 10.0% year over year increase in single family housing starts according to the U.S. Census Bureau, (ii) improvements in the repair and remodeling market evidenced by the 5.6% increase in homeowner improvements during 2015 versus 2014 according to LIRA, (iii) the positive income contributions from our acquisition of Simonton which was completed in September 2014, and (iv) continued improvements in our existing operations specifically for our U.S. windows business which increased its operating earnings by approximately $45.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. All of these items increased our taxable income estimate for the year ended December 31, 2015 and, as a result, our estimate of the TRA liability.\nLoss on modification or extinguishment of debt\nDuring November 2017, we voluntarily paid $40.0 million on the Term Loan Facility to reduce our outstanding indebtedness as allowable under the terms of the agreement governing the Term Loan Facility. We performed an analysis to determine the proper accounting treatment for this voluntary payment by evaluating the change in cash flows and determining that there were no changes in the creditors as a result of the payment. Consequently, we recognized a loss on debt modification or extinguishment of approximately $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisting of the proportionate write off of the related debt issuance costs and debt discount.\nDuring 2016, we voluntarily paid $160.0 million on the Term Loan Facility to reduce our outstanding indebtedness as allowable under the terms of the agreement governing the Term Loan Facility. We performed an analysis to determine the proper accounting treatment for these voluntary payments by evaluating the change in cash flows and determining that there were no changes in the creditors as a result of the payment. Consequently, we recognized a loss on debt modification or extinguishment of approximately $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisting of the proportionate write off of the related debt issuance costs and debt discount.\nIncome taxes\nThe income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $98.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily related to an increase in pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the reversal of the valuation allowance for federal and certain state jurisdictions during the year ended December 31, 2016. The income tax provision of approximately $46.7 million is comprised of $40.7 million of federal tax expense, $6.5 million of state tax expense, and a $0.5 million foreign income tax benefit. Our pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $115.0 million including the $10.7 million Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment compared to pre-tax income of $23.5 million including the $60.9 million Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we remain in a valuation allowance position for certain state and Canadian jurisdictions.\nThe income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to an approximate $52.0 million tax benefit compared to an approximate $0.7 million tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015. The income tax benefit of approximately $52.0 million is comprised of $53.6 million of federal tax benefit, $2.6 million state tax expense, and $1.0 million foreign income tax benefit. The increase in tax benefit is primarily due to the release of the discrete valuation allowance of $55.2 million partially offset by state income tax, remaining valuation allowances, and foreign income taxes. Our pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $23.5 million including the $60.9 million tax receivable agreement liability adjustment compared to pre-tax income of $31.6 million including the $12.9 million tax receivable agreement liability adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, makes broad and complex changes to the Code including, but not limited to, reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations, eliminating the corporate AMT and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized, creating the BEAT, creating a general limitation on deductible interest expense, and changing rules related to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years after December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, as a result of the corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 enacted in the Tax Act, we recorded an expense of $4.3 million due to the re-measurement of the deferred tax assets at the reduced income tax rate which reduced the future benefit we will realize associated with these assets. This expense has been recognized in income taxes within our consolidated statement of operations.\nASC 740 Income Taxes requires a company to record the effects of a tax law change in the period of enactment. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the recently enacted Tax Act, SAB 118 requires that we include in our financial statements a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimate has been determined. Accordingly, we have performed an earnings and profits analysis associated with the one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result of accumulated losses, there will be no income tax effect recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 based on the reasonable estimate guidance provided by SAB 118. We are continuing to assess the impact from the Tax Act and may record further adjustments in 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n2015 Debt Transaction\nOn November 5, 2015, Ply Gem Industries entered into a second amended and restated ABL Facility. Among other things, the second amended and restated ABL Facility: (i) increased the overall facility to $350.0 million, (ii) provided an accordion feature of $50.0 million, and (iii) established the applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility to a range of 1.25% to 2.00% for Eurodollar rate loans, depending on availability. All outstanding loans under the second amended and restated ABL Facility are due and payable in full on November 5, 2020.\nGeneral cash flow movements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents increased to $71.4 million compared to approximately $51.6 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase in cash was driven by a $5.8 million improvement in operating earnings, $5.0 million lower TRA payments and $120.0 million less in voluntary payments on the Term Loan Facility in 2017 versus 2016 partially offset by $43.1 million lower operating cash flow. The improved operating performance was offset by a $38.1 million increase in working capital during the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016. Accounts receivable increased $24.7 million and inventory increased $22.9 million offset by a $9.5 million improvement in trade payables during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016. The approximate $24.7 million accounts receivable increase from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 resulted primarily from the increase in December sales year over year. The net sales for December 2017 were approximately $177.4 million and the net sales for December 2016 were approximately $152.2 million. The approximate $22.9 million inventory increase from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 resulted from higher raw material costs in 2017 combined with higher inventory levels at December 31, 2017 in anticipation of higher sales volumes in 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $57.8 million to $51.6 million as of December 31, 2016.\nOur business is seasonal because inclement weather during the winter months reduces the level of building and remodeling activity in both the home repair and remodeling and the new home construction sectors, especially in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States and Canada. As a result, our liquidity typically increases during the second and third quarters as our borrowing base increases under the ABL Facility reaching a peak early in the fourth quarter, and decreases late in the fourth quarter and throughout the first quarter.\nOur primary cash needs are for working capital, capital expenditures and debt service. Our annual cash interest charges for debt service under the current organizational structure, including the ABL Facility, are estimated to be approximately $54.0 million for fiscal year 2018. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any scheduled debt maturities until 2020. The specific debt instruments and their corresponding terms and due dates are described in the following sections. Our capital expenditures have historically averaged approximately 1.5% to 2.0% of net sales on an annual basis. For the year ending December 31, 2018, we estimate that our capital expenditures will be in a range from 2.00% to 2.25% of net sales. We finance these cash requirements through internally generated cash flow and funds borrowed under Ply Gem Industries' ABL Facility.\nPly Gem's specific cash flow movement for the year ended December 31, 2017 is summarized below:\nCash provided by operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $101.9 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $145.0 million, and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $139.4 million. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was driven by improved housing conditions that drove the 7.6% net sales increase offset by decreases in cash flows related to our working capital increase as a result of the net sales increase, rising commodity costs, and our aggressiveness in taking early pay discounts. These conditions resulted in an unfavorable $38.1 million impact in our primary working capital for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe relative consistency in net cash provided by operating activities between 2016 and 2015 was primarily driven by the $43.2 million increase in net income during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 partially offset by the $40.1 million working capital increase.\nCash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was approximately $37.9 million, $35.8 million, and $54.7 million, respectively. The cash used in investing activities during 2017 was primarily for capital expenditures which were approximately 2.0%, consistent with our historical average. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold a building in Saskatoon, Canada for approximately $2.1 million. The Company moved to another leased facility within the Saskatoon area that more closely aligns with the Company's needs in that area.\nThe cash used in investing activities during 2016 was primarily for capital expenditures on numerous ongoing capital projects across all business segments. Capital expenditures for 2016 were approximately 1.9% of net sales, consistent with our historical average.\nThe cash used in investing activities in 2015 was primarily for the acquisition of Canyon Stone and capital expenditures on various ongoing capital projects. The Canyon Stone acquisition was approximately $21.0 million net of cash acquired. Capital expenditures for 2015 were approximately 1.8% of net sales, consistent with our historical average.\nCash used in financing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $44.3 million, primarily from the $40.0 million voluntary Term Loan Facility payment made in November 2017, the 1.0% principal repayment of $4.3 million required by the Term Loan Facility, and $1.2 million in tax withholding related to employee stock grant issuances. These payments were offset by $1.2 million in cash provided by the exercise of stock options.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $168.2 million, primarily from the three separate voluntary Term Loan Facility payments that totaled $160.0 million and the 1.0% principal repayment of $4.3 million required by the Term Loan Facility and the Tax Receivable Agreement payment of $5.0 million. These payments were offset by $1.1 million in cash provided by the exercise of stock options.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $3.6 million, primarily related to the 1.0% principal repayment of $4.3 million required by the Term Loan Facility and the payment of $1.4 million in debt issuance costs. These payments were offset by $2.2 million in cash provided by the exercise of stock options.\nPly Gem's specific debt instruments and terms are described below:\n6.50% Senior Notes due 2022\nOn January 30, 2014, Ply Gem Industries issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes at par. On September 19, 2014, Ply Gem Industries issued an additional $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes (the \"Senior Tack-on Notes\") at an issue price of 93.25%. Interest accrues at 6.50% per annum and is paid semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The 6.50% Senior Notes will mature on February 1, 2022. At any time on or after February 1, 2017, Ply Gem Industries may redeem the 6.50% Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at declining redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 6.50% Senior Notes plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The effective interest rate for the 6.50% Senior Notes is 8.39% after considering each of the different interest expense components of this instrument, including the coupon payment and the deferred debt issuance costs.\nThe 6.50% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Ply Gem Holdings and all of the wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of Ply Gem Industries (the Guarantors\u201d). The indenture governing the 6.50% Senior Notes contains certain covenants that limit the ability of Ply Gem Industries and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem their stock, make loans and investments, sell assets, incur certain liens, enter into agreements restricting their ability to pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates, and consolidate, merge or sell assets. In particular, Ply Gem Industries and its restricted subsidiaries may not incur additional debt (other than permitted debt (as defined in the indenture) in limited circumstances) unless, after giving effect to such incurrence, the consolidated interest coverage ratio of Ply Gem Industries would be at least 2.00 to 1.00.\nIn the absence of satisfying the consolidated interest coverage ratio test, Ply Gem Industries and its restricted subsidiaries may only incur additional debt under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, debt under credit facilities (as defined in the indenture) (x) in an amount not to exceed the greater of (a) $350.0 million and (b) the borrowing base (as defined in the indenture) and (y) in an amount not to exceed the greater of (A) $575.0 million and (B) the aggregate amount of indebtedness (as defined in the indenture) that that would cause the consolidated secured debt ratio (as defined in the indenture) to be equal to 4.00 to 1.00; purchase money indebtedness in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $35.0 million and (y) 10% of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the indenture) at any one time outstanding; debt of foreign subsidiaries in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $60.0 million and (y) 15% of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the indenture) at any one time outstanding; debt pursuant to a general basket in an aggregate amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the greater of (x) $75.0 million and (y) 20% of consolidated net tangible assets; and the refinancing of debt under certain circumstances.\nOn September 5, 2014, Ply Gem Industries completed an exchange offer with respect to the 6.50% Senior Notes issued in January 2014 to exchange $500.0 million 6.50% Senior Notes registered under the Securities Act for $500.0 million of the issued and outstanding 6.50% Senior Notes. Upon completion of the exchange offer, all $500.0 million of issued and outstanding 6.50% Senior Notes were registered under the Securities Act. On January 23, 2015, Ply Gem Industries completed an exchange offer with respect to the Senior Tack-on Notes issued in September 2014 to exchange $150.0 million Senior Tack-on Notes registered under the Securities Act for $150.0 million of the issued and outstanding Senior Tack-on Notes. Upon completion of the exchange offer, all $150.0 million of issued and outstanding Senior Tack-on Notes were registered under the Securities Act.\nTerm Loan Facility due 2021\nOn January 30, 2014, Ply Gem Industries entered into a credit agreement governing the terms of its $430.0 million Term Loan Facility. Ply Gem Industries originally borrowed $430.0 million under the Term Loan Facility on January 30, 2014, with an original discount of approximately $2.2 million, yielding proceeds of approximately $427.9 million. The Term Loan Facility will mature on January 30, 2021. The Term Loan Facility requires scheduled quarterly payments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.00% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan Facility with the balance due at maturity. Interest on outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility is paid quarterly.\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at Ply Gem Industries' option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the prime rate of the administrative agent under the credit agreement, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (iii) the adjusted LIBO rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00% or (b) a LIBO rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for eurocurrency deposits in dollars for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a 1.00% floor, plus, in each case, an applicable margin of 3.00% for any eurocurrency loan and 2.00% for any alternate base rate loan. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was 4.00%. The effective interest rate for the Term Loan is 8.60% after considering each of the different interest expense components of this instrument, including the coupon payment, the deferred debt issuance costs and the original issue discount.\nThe Term Loan Facility allows Ply Gem Industries to request one or more incremental term loan facilities in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $140.0 million and (y) an amount such that Ply Gem Industries' consolidated senior secured debt ratio (as defined in the credit agreement), on a pro forma basis, does not exceed 3.75 to 1.00, in each case, subject to certain conditions and receipt of commitments by existing or additional financial institutions or institutional lenders.\nThe Term Loan Facility requires Ply Gem Industries to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with: (i) 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% if our consolidated senior secured debt ratio is equal or less than 2.50 to 1.00 but greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and to 0% if our consolidated senior secured debt ratio is equal to or less than 2.00 to 1.00) of our annual excess cash flow (as defined in the credit agreement), to the extent such excess cash flow exceeds $15.0 million, commencing with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015; (ii) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or certain insurance and condemnation proceeds, in each case subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights; and (iii) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain issuances of debt, other than proceeds from debt permitted under the Term Loan Facility. Ply Gem Industries may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Term Loan Facility at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage\u201d costs with respect to LIBOR loans. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's consolidated senior secured debt ratio was 0.66 and as a result no excess cash flow payment under the Term Loan Facility will be required. However, we elected on November 3, 2017 to voluntarily prepay $40.0 million on the Term Loan Facility to reduce our outstanding indebtedness bringing our cumulative voluntary 2016 and 2017 Term Loan Facility payments to $200.0 million as we elected on March 10, 2016 and August 4, 2016 to voluntarily prepay $30.0 million on each date and elected on November 4, 2016 to voluntarily pay an additional $100.0 million on the Term Loan Facility.\nThe Term Loan Facility is secured on a first-priority lien basis by the stock of Ply Gem Industries and by substantially all of the assets (other than the assets securing the obligations under the ABL Facility, which primarily consist of accounts receivable, inventory, cash, deposit accounts, securities accounts, chattel paper, contract rights, instruments, documents related thereto and proceeds of the foregoing) of Ply Gem Industries and the Guarantors that are subsidiaries of Ply Gem Industries and on a second-priority lien basis by the assets that secure the ABL Facility.\nThe Term Loan Facility includes negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, that are substantially the same as the negative covenants in the 6.50% Senior Notes but does not contain any restrictive financial covenants. The Term Loan Facility also restricts the ability of Ply Gem Industries' subsidiaries to enter into agreements restricting their ability to grant liens to secure the Term Loan Facility and contains a restriction on changes in fiscal year.\nSenior Secured Asset Based Revolving Credit Facility due 2020\nOn November 5, 2015, Ply Gem Holdings, Inc., Ply Gem Industries, Inc., Gienow Canada Inc., and Mitten Inc. (together with Gienow, the Canadian Borrowers\u201d) entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement governing the ABL Facility. Among other things, the second amendment and restatement of the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility: (i) increased the overall facility to $350.0 million from $300.0 million, (ii) established an accordion feature of $50.0 million, (iii) reduced the applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility to a range from 1.25% to 2.00% for Eurodollar rate loans, depending on availability, and (iv) extended the maturity until November 5, 2020. Under the ABL Facility, $300.0 million is available to Ply Gem Industries and $50.0 million is available to the Canadian Borrowers. The following summary describes the ABL Facility after giving effect to the amendment and restatement. As a result of the ABL Facility amendment in which the loan syndication consisted of previous members who either maintained or increased their position as well as new syndication members, the Company capitalized new debt issuance costs of $1.5 million and amortizes these costs through 2020.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at Ply Gem Industries' option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the corporate base rate of the administrative agent under the ABL Facility and (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (b) a Eurodollar rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, in each case plus an applicable margin. The initial applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility was 0.50% for base rate loans and 1.50% for Eurodollar rate loans. The applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility is subject to step ups and step downs based on average excess availability under the ABL Facility. Swingline loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the base rate plus the applicable margin.\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the ABL Facility, Ply Gem Industries is required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder, which fee will be determined based on utilization of the ABL Facility (increasing when utilization is low and decreasing when utilization is high) multiplied by a commitment fee rate determined by reference to average excess availability under the ABL Facility. The commitment fee rate during any fiscal quarter is 0.375% when average excess availability is greater than $100.0 million for the preceding fiscal quarter and 0.25% when average availability is less than or equal to $100.0 million for the preceding fiscal quarter. Ply Gem Industries must also pay customary letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin on Eurodollar loans and agency fees. As of December 31, 2017, our interest rate on the ABL Facility was approximately 2.56%. The ABL Facility requires that if (a) excess availability is less than the greater of (x) 10.0% of the lower of the borrowing base and the aggregate commitments and (y) $25.0 million or (b) any event of default has occurred and is continuing, Ply Gem Industries must comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test of 1.0 to 1.0. If the excess availability under the ABL Facility is less than the greater of (a) 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the aggregate commitments and (b) $30.0 million ($27.5 million for the months of January, February, March and April) for a period of 5 consecutive days or an event of default has occurred and is continuing, all cash from Ply Gem Industries material deposit accounts (including all concentration accounts) will be swept daily into a collection account controlled by the administrative agent under the ABL Facility and used to repay outstanding loans and cash collateralize letters of credit.\nAll obligations under the ABL Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by Ply Gem Holdings and substantially all of Ply Gem Industries' existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. All obligations under the ABL Facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the assets of Ply Gem Industries and the guarantors, including a first-priority security interest in personal property consisting of accounts receivable, inventory, cash, deposit accounts, and certain related assets and proceeds of the foregoing and a second-priority security interest in, and mortgages on, substantially all of Ply Gem Industries' and the Guarantors' material owned real property and equipment and all assets that secure the Term Loan Facility on a first-priority basis. In addition to being secured by the collateral securing the obligations of Ply Gem Industries under the domestic collateral package, the obligations of the Canadian Borrowers, which are borrowers under the Canadian sub-facility under the ABL Facility, are also secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of such Canadian subsidiaries, plus additional mortgages in Canada, and a pledge by Ply Gem Industries of the remaining 35% of the equity interests of the Canadian Borrowers pledged only to secure the Canadian sub-facility.\nThe ABL Facility contains certain covenants that limit Ply Gem Industries' ability and the ability of Ply Gem Industries' subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem their stock, make loans and investments, sell assets, incur certain liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, and consolidate, merge or sell assets.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Ply Gem Industries had approximately $340.3 million of contractual availability and approximately $261.5 million of borrowing base availability under the ABL Facility, reflecting $0.0 million of borrowings outstanding and approximately $9.7 million of letters of credit and priority payables reserves.\nLoss on debt modification or extinguishment\nDuring both March and August 2016, the Company made voluntarily payments of $30.0 million on the Term Loan Facility to reduce its outstanding indebtedness as allowable under the terms of the agreement governing the Term Loan Facility and further elected in November 2016 to voluntarily pay an additional $100.0 million on the Term Loan Facility bringing the cumulative 2016 voluntary payments to $160.0 million. The Company performed an analysis to determine the proper accounting treatment for each of these voluntary payments by evaluating the change in cash flows and determined that there were no changes in creditors as a result of the payments. Consequently, the Company recognized a loss on debt modification in the consolidated statement of operations of approximately $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting the proportionate write-off of the related debt discount ($9.4 million) and debt issuance costs ($2.4 million) associated with the $160.0 million in voluntary payments, as summarized in the table below.\nDuring November 2017, we made a voluntarily payment of $40.0 million on the Term Loan Facility to reduce our outstanding indebtedness as allowable under the terms of the agreement governing the Term Loan Facility. We performed an analysis to determine the proper accounting treatment for each of these voluntary payments by evaluating the change in cash flows and determined that there were no changes in creditors as a result of the payments. Consequently, we recognized a loss on debt modification in the consolidated statement of operations of approximately $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting the proportionate write-off of the related debt discount ($1.7 million) and debt issuance costs ($0.4 million) associated with this $40.0 million voluntary payment, as summarized in the table below.\nBased on these financing transactions, we recognized a loss on debt modification or extinguishment of approximately $2.1 million, $11.7 million and $0.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, as summarized in the table below.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on modification of debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan Facility unamortized discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,681\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9,375\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan Facility unamortized debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(425\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,372\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loss on modification or extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,747\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity requirements\nWe intend to fund our ongoing capital and working capital requirements, including our internal growth, through a combination of cash flows from operations and, if necessary, from borrowings under our ABL Facility. We believe that we will continue to meet our liquidity requirements over the next 12 months. We believe that our operating units are positive cash flow generating units and will continue to sustain their operations without any significant liquidity concerns. The performance of these operating units is significantly impacted by the performance of the housing industry, specifically single family housing starts and the repair and remodeling activity. Any unforeseen or unanticipated downturn in the housing industry could have a negative impact on our liquidity position.\nManagement anticipates that our current liquidity position, as well as expected cash flows from our operations should be sufficient to meet ongoing operational cash flow needs, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and other fees payable under other contractual obligations for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $71.4 million, approximately $340.3 million of contractual availability under the ABL Facility and approximately $261.5 million of borrowing base availability.\nIn order to further supplement the Company's operating cash flow, the Company has from time to time opportunistically accessed capital markets based on prevailing economic and financial conditions. Based on market conditions, the Company may elect to pursue additional financing alternatives in the future.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations under financing arrangements and lease commitments, including interest amounts, as of December 31, 2017. Interest on the 6.50% Senior Notes is fixed. Interest on the Term Loan Facility is variable and has been presented at the average rate of approximately 4.8% based on the current LIBOR rate plus 1.0% structure of the instrument with consideration toward anticipated interest rate increases over the applicable term. Interest on the ABL Facility is variable and has been presented at the average rate of approximately 2.6% using the average principal balance during 2017 as a projection for future years' average balances. Actual interest rates for future periods may differ from those presented here.\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>883,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>850,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cancelable lease commitments (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140,048\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,578\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,383,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>211,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>952,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Long-term debt is shown before discount, and consists of our 6.50% Senior Notes, Term Loan Facility, and ABL Facility. This amount excludes any estimate for excess cash flow payments that may be required under the Term Loan Facility. For more information concerning the long-term debt, see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d above. \n (2) Interest payments for variable interest debt are based on current interest rates. \n (3) Non-cancelable lease commitments represent lease payments for facilities and equipment. \n (4) Purchase obligations are defined as purchase agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including quantity, price and the approximate timing of the transaction. These obligations are related primarily to inventory purchases under two 2018 contracts that were finalized during 2017. \n (5) Other long-term liabilities include pension obligations which are estimated based on our 2017 annual funding requirements. Because we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future tax payments related to uncertain tax positions, certain tax related obligations of approximately $4.5 million, including interest and penalties of approximately $1.9 million, have been excluded from the table above. Additionally, because we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future tax payments related to the Tax Receivable Agreement, certain tax related obligations of approximately $69.5 million, have been excluded from the table above. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation; Seasonality\nOur performance is dependent to a significant extent upon the levels of home repair and remodeling and new home construction spending, all of which are affected by such factors as interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence and unemployment. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the past three fiscal years.\nThe demand for our products is seasonal, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States and Canada where inclement weather conditions during the winter months usually reduces the level of building and remodeling activity in both the home repair and remodeling and the new home construction sectors. Our sales in both segments are usually lower during the first and fourth quarters. Since a portion of our manufacturing overhead and operating expenses are relatively fixed throughout the year, operating income and net earnings tend to be lower in quarters with lower sales levels. In addition, the demand for cash to fund our working capital is greater from late in the fourth quarter through the first quarter.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements, which are hereby incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 7.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to clarify the results of our operations, certain changes in our financial position, liquidity, capital structure and business developments for the years covered by the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, the other related information including, but not limited to, the audited consolidated financial statements (including the notes thereto and the independent registered public accounting firm's reports thereon), and the description of our business, all as set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors discussed below and in Item 1A.\nCertain statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d are forward-looking statements.\u201d See Cautionary Statement with Respect to Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d\nGeneral\nWe are a leading manufacturer of exterior building products in North America, operating in two reportable segments: (i) Siding, Fencing, and Stone and (ii) Windows and Doors, which comprised approximately 47% and 53% of our sales, respectively, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. These two segments produce a comprehensive product line of vinyl siding, designer accents, cellular PVC trim, vinyl fencing, vinyl and composite railing, stone veneer and vinyl windows and doors used in both the new construction market and the home repair and remodeling market in the United States and Canada. Vinyl building products have the leading share of sales volume in siding and windows in the United States. We also manufacture vinyl and aluminum soffit and siding accessories, aluminum trim coil, wood windows, aluminum windows, vinyl and aluminum-clad windows and steel and fiberglass doors, enabling us to bundle complementary and color-matched products and accessories with our core products. We believe that our comprehensive product portfolio and geographically diverse, low cost manufacturing platform allow us to better serve our customers and provide us with a competitive advantage over other exterior building products suppliers.\nThe following is a summary of Ply Gem's recent acquisition history:\n \u2022 On September 19, 2014, Ply Gem completed an acquisition for cash consideration of approximately $130.0 million to acquire the capital stock of Fortune Brands Windows, Inc., and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries Simonton Building Products LLC, Simonton Industries, Inc., Simonton Windows, Inc., and SimEx, Inc. Simonton is a premier repair and remodeling window company with leading brand recognition and is part of the Windows and Doors segment. \n \u2022 On May 29, 2015, Ply Gem acquired substantially all of the assets of Canyon Stone, Inc. ( Canyon Stone\u201d), a manufacturer of stone veneer, for a purchase price of $21.0 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. Canyon Stone is included in our Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment. \nPrior to January 11, 2010, Ply Gem Holdings was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ply Gem Investment Holdings, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ply Gem Prime. On January 11, 2010, Ply Gem Investment Holdings merged with and into Ply Gem Prime, with Ply Gem Prime being the surviving corporation. In May 2013, the Company issued 18,157,895 shares of common stock in an initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) and received gross proceeds of approximately $381.3 million in the IPO. The shares began trading on The New York Stock Exchange on May 23, 2013 under the symbol \"PGEM\". Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, Ply Gem Prime merged with and into Ply Gem Holdings, with Ply Gem Holdings being the surviving entity. In the merger, all of the preferred stock of Ply Gem Prime (including the subordinated debt of Ply Gem Prime that was converted into preferred stock in connection with the IPO) was converted into a number of shares of the Company's common stock based on the IPO price of the common stock and the liquidation value of and the maximum dividend amount in respect of the preferred stock.\nOn January 31, 2018, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub, each a wholly owned subsidiary of funds sponsored by CD&R. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the Merger\u201d), with Ply Gem Holdings surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the Acquisition\u201d). At the Effective Time, each of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, will be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive $21.64 in cash, without interest (the Merger Consideration\u201d), less any applicable withholding taxes. The consummation of the Merger remains subject to customary closing conditions. As a result of the Merger, we will cease to be a publicly traded company.\nWe are a holding company with no operations or assets of our own other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries. The terms of Ply Gem Industries' $350.0 million ABL Facility and the credit agreement governing the terms of its $430.0 million Term Loan Facility place restrictions on the ability of Ply Gem Industries and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends and otherwise transfer assets to us. Further, the terms of the indenture governing Ply Gem Industries' $650.0 million 6.50% Senior Notes place restrictions on the ability of Ply Gem Industries and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends and otherwise transfer assets to us.\nFinancial statement presentation\nNet sales. Net sales represent the fixed selling price of our products plus certain shipping charges less applicable provisions for discounts and allowances. Allowances include cash discounts, volume rebates and returns among others.\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold includes direct material and manufacturing costs, manufacturing depreciation, third-party and in-house delivery costs and product warranty expense.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG&A expense\u201d) includes all non-product related operating expenses, including selling, marketing, research and development costs, information technology, and other general and administrative expenses.\nOperating earnings (loss). Operating earnings (loss) represents net sales less cost of products sold, SG&A expense, and amortization of intangible assets.\nImpact of commodity pricing\nPVC resin, aluminum, and glass are major components in the production of our products and changes in PVC resin, aluminum, and glass prices have a direct impact on our cost of products sold. Historically, we have been able to pass on a substantial portion of significant price increases to our customers. The results of operations for individual quarters can be negatively impacted by a delay between the time of raw material cost increases and price increases that we implement in our products, or conversely can be positively impacted by a delay between the time of a raw material price decrease and competitive pricing moves that we implement accordingly.\nImpact of weather\nSince our building products are intended for exterior use, our sales and operating earnings tend to be lower during periods of inclement weather. Weather conditions in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year historically result in these quarters producing significantly less sales revenue than our second and third quarters of the year. As a result, we have historically had lower profits or higher losses in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. Our results of operations for individual quarters in the future may be impacted by adverse weather conditions. In addition, favorable or unfavorable weather conditions may influence the comparability of our results from year to year or from quarter to quarter.\nCritical accounting policies\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of judgments in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We periodically evaluate the judgments and estimates used for our critical accounting policies to ensure that such judgments and estimates are reasonable for our interim and year-end reporting requirements. These judgments and estimates are based upon our historical experience, current trends and information available from other sources, as appropriate. If different conditions occur compared to our assumptions and judgments, the results could be materially different from our estimates. Management also believes that the nine areas where different assumptions could result in materially different reported results are (1) goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests, (2) accounts receivable related to the estimation of allowances for doubtful accounts, (3) inventories in estimating reserves for obsolete and excess inventory, (4) warranty reserves, (5) insurance reserves, (6) income taxes including the Tax Receivable Agreement, (7) rebates, (8) pensions, and (9) environmental accruals and other contingencies. Although we believe the likelihood of a material difference in these areas is low based upon our historical experience, a 10% change in our allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory provision estimates, and warranty reserve at December 31, 2017 would result in an approximate $0.3 million, $0.8 million, and $7.7 million impact on expenses, respectively. Additionally, we have included in the discussion that follows our estimation methodology for both accounts receivable and inventories. While all significant policies are important to our consolidated financial statements, some of these policies may be viewed as being critical. Our critical accounting policies include:\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize sales based upon shipment of products to our customers net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances. Generally, the customer takes title upon shipment and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the product. For certain products, it is industry standard that customers take title to products upon delivery, at which time revenue is then recognized by the Company. Revenue includes the selling price of the product and all shipping costs paid by the customer. Revenue is reduced at the time of sale for estimated sales returns and all applicable allowances and discounts based on historical experience. We also provide for estimates of warranty, shipping costs and certain sales-related customer programs at the time of sale. Shipping and warranty costs are included in cost of products sold. Bad debt expense and certain marketing expenses are included in SG&A expense. We believe that our procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are reconciled to the actual amounts. Starting in fiscal 2018, in connection with the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we expect to include additional disaggregated revenue disclosures.\nAccounts Receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of our customers to make required payments, which is provided for in bad debt expense. We determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing our accounts receivable aging and evaluating individual customers' receivables, considering customers' financial condition, credit history and other current economic conditions. If a customer's financial condition was to deteriorate, which might impact its ability to make payment, then additional allowances may be required.\nInventories. Inventories in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We record provisions, as appropriate, to write-down obsolete and excess inventory to estimated net realizable value. The process for evaluating obsolete and excess inventory often requires subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may cause actual results to differ from the estimates at the time such inventory is disposed or sold.\nGoodwill Impairment. We perform an annual test for goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each year (November 25th for 2017) and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may exceed their fair value. We early adopted ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and other (Topic 350) during the year ended December 31, 2017. As such, we measure the goodwill impairment as the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in a reporting unit. We have elected not to utilize the qualitative Step Zero impairment assessment. There was no goodwill impairment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. However, we will continue to evaluate goodwill during future years and future declines in the residential housing and repair and remodeling markets or our market capitalization could result in goodwill impairments.\nTo evaluate goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of reporting units considering such factors as discounted cash flows and valuation multiples for comparable publicly traded companies. A significant reduction in projected sales and earnings which would lead to a reduction in future cash flows could indicate potential impairment.\nA summary of the key assumptions utilized in the goodwill impairment analysis at November 25, 2017, November 26, 2016, and November 28, 2015, as it relates to the fair values and the sensitivities for these assumptions follows:\n\nAs of November 25, 2017, we reduced the terminal year estimated housing starts assumption from 1,100,000 in 2016 to 1,049,000 for the 2017 valuation, which reflects a normalized housing start level with an adjustment for potential pullback during the terminal period as the U.S. housing market has been in a growing market for over seven years. We estimate that normalized recurring housing starts will be in a range of 1,000,000 to 1,200,000 to keep up with U.S. population growth according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. We also maintained our terminal growth rate assumption at 3.0% for the three-year period, which is 0.5% lower than the assumption utilized in the Windows and Doors analysis due to Windows and Doors' higher correlation with the new construction market, which provides higher growth levels as we return to a normalized housing market. As of November 25, 2017, we increased Siding, Fencing, and Stone's discount rate by 0.5% to 11.5%, due to the risk associated with the decrease in operating earnings of $10.3 million or 6.6% from higher material costs not fully offset by higher net selling prices despite the net sales increase of $83.3 million achieved during 2017. As of November 26, 2016, we decreased Siding, Fencing, and Stone's discount rate by 0.5% to 11.0%, due to the consistent profitable financial performance demonstrated by Siding, Fencing, and Stone increasing their operating earnings $22.4 million or 16.6% during 2016.\n\nAs of November 25, 2017, we reduced the terminal year estimated housing starts assumption from 1,100,000 in 2016 to 1,049,000 for the 2017 valuation, which reflects a normalized housing start level with an adjustment for a potential pullback during the terminal period as the U.S. housing market has been in a growing market for over seven years. As of November 25, 2017, we increased the Windows and Doors' discount rate by 2.0% to 18.0% to account for the risk associated with continuing projected gross margin expansion within the competitive building products industry combined with the risk of a pullback in the terminal year despite the $12.9 million or 29.5% improvement in operating earnings achieved during 2017. As of November 26, 2016, we decreased the Windows and Doors' discount rate by 1.0% to 16.0% as a reflection of the improved operating performance of the Windows and Doors reporting unit which increased their operating earnings $25.4 million or 139.5% during the year ended December 31, 2016 due to improved gross profit margins resulting from higher selling prices and favorable material costs.\nAs of November 25, 2017, we maintained the Windows and Doors' control premium at 10.0%, consistent with the prior year due to the consistent performance of the business achieved during 2017.\nOverall, we utilize the same key assumptions in preparing the prospective financial information ( PFI\u201d) utilized in the discounted cash flow test for the Siding, Fencing, and Stone and Windows and Doors reporting units. However, each reporting unit is impacted differently by industry trends, how market factors are influencing the reporting units' expected performance, competition, and other unique business factors as mentioned above. The Windows and Doors reporting unit has more exposure to the new construction market which experienced depressed housing market conditions during 2009-2011, which ultimately decreased operating performance for this reporting unit. Siding, Fencing, and Stone's performance has been more consistent and profitable resulting in less risk in the PFI.\n\nAs of November 25, 2017, the discounted cash flow method valuation produced a higher value for both reporting units than the guideline public company method and as such the change to market multiple weighting would reduce the 2017 valuation.\nWe provide no assurance that: (1) valuation multiples will not decline, (2) discount rates will not increase, or (3) the earnings, book values or projected earnings and cash flows of our reporting units will not decline. We will continue to analyze changes to these assumptions in future periods. We will continue to evaluate goodwill during future periods and future declines in the residential housing and remodeling markets could result in future goodwill impairments.\nIncome Taxes. We utilize the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes, which requires that the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the amounts included in our federal, state, and foreign income tax returns be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The amount recorded in our consolidated financial statements reflects estimates of final amounts due to timing of completion and filing of actual income tax returns. Estimates are required with respect to, among other things, the appropriate state income tax rates used in the various states in which we and our subsidiaries are required to file, the potential utilization of operating and capital loss carry-forwards for federal, state, and foreign income tax purposes and valuation allowances required, if any, for tax assets that may not be realized in the future. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, certain positions could be challenged, and the positions may not be fully sustained. We have executed a tax sharing agreement with Ply Gem Holdings and Ply Gem Investment Holdings pursuant to which tax liabilities for each respective party are computed on a stand-alone basis. The tax sharing agreement was amended in 2013 to reflect the merger of Ply Gem Prime Holdings with and into Ply Gem Holdings. Our U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return, unitary, combined, or separate state income tax returns. Gienow Canada and Mitten file separate Canadian income tax returns.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we determined that a valuation allowance was no longer required against our net federal deferred tax assets and a portion of our net state deferred tax assets. As a result, we released approximately $86.5 million of our valuation allowance since positive evidence outweighed negative evidence thereby allowing us to achieve the more likely than not\u201d realization threshold. We still remain in a valuation allowance position at December 31, 2017 against our deferred tax assets for certain state and Canadian jurisdictions as it is currently deemed more likely than not\u201d that the benefit of such net tax assets will not be utilized as the Company continues to be in a three-year cumulative loss position for these states and Canadian jurisdictions. Refer to Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes.\nTax Receivable Agreement ( TRA\u201d) Liability. The TRA liability generally provides for our payment to the Tax Receivable Entity of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in the U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we actually realize in periods ending after the IPO as a result of (i) net operating loss carryovers (\"NOLs\") from periods ending before January 1, 2013, (ii) deductible expenses attributable to the IPO and (iii) deductions related to imputed interest. Since the inception of the TRA liability with the 2013 IPO, we have historically had a full valuation allowance for federal purposes and had partial valuation allowances on certain state and Canadian jurisdictions. As a result of the tax valuation allowance position for federal and state purposes, we historically calculated the TRA liability considering (i) current year taxable income only (due to the uncertainty of future taxable income associated with the Company's previous cumulative loss position) and (ii) future income due to the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we released our discrete valuation allowance on our federal deferred tax assets and certain state deferred tax assets of approximately $55.2 million, due to positive factors outweighing negative evidence thereby allowing us to achieve the more likely than not\u201d realization threshold. The factors surrounding the release of this valuation allowance thereby eliminated any uncertainty as to future taxable income. Consequently, for purposes of calculating the TRA liability, we utilized future forecasts of taxable income beyond the 2016 tax year to determine the TRA liability. Our future taxable income estimate was used to determine the cumulative NOLs that are expected to be utilized and the TRA liability was accordingly adjusted using the 85% TRA rate as we retain the benefit of 15% of the tax savings. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had a $69.5 million and $79.7 million liability, respectively, for the amount due pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nASC 740 Income Taxes requires a company to record the effects of a tax law change in the period of enactment. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the recently enacted Tax Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB\u201d) 118 requires that the company include in its financial statements a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimate has been determined. Accordingly, we have performed an earnings and profits analysis associated with the one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result of accumulated losses, there will be no income tax effect recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 based on the reasonable estimate guidance provided by SAB 118. We are continuing to assess the impact from the Tax Act and may record further adjustments in 2018.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes net sales and net income by segment and is derived from the accompanying consolidated statements of operations included in this report.\n\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations based on the amounts and the percentage relationship of the items listed to net sales for the periods indicated. However, our results of operations set forth in the tables below may not necessarily be representative of our future operating results.\nThis review of performance is organized by business segment, reflecting the way we manage our business. Each business group leader is responsible for operating results down to operating earnings (loss). We use operating earnings as a performance measure as it captures the income and expenses within the management control of our business leaders. Corporate management is responsible for making all financing decisions. Therefore, each segment discussion focuses on the factors affecting operating earnings, while interest expense and income taxes and certain other unallocated expenses are separately discussed at the corporate level.\nSiding, Fencing, and Stone Segment\n\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $83.3 million or 9.4% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The 9.4% net sales increase was driven by a $76.5 million or 9.4% net sales increase for the U.S. market and a net sales increase of $6.8 million or 9.1% for the Canadian market for the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016. In the U.S. market, the 9.4% net sales increase resulted from improved U.S. market demand for our products, new business wins, and higher average selling prices, which increased in response to higher material costs. The favorable U.S. demand factors increased our vinyl siding unit sales by 7.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, our average selling prices increased 0.5% in response to higher material costs resulting in higher net sales of approximately $15.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Overall, we achieved the 9.4% net sales increase in the U.S. market from improved volume, price, and market share gains that were partially offset by inventory buybacks of $2.7 million related to new business wins during the year ended December 31, 2017. In Canada, we achieved the 9.1% net sales increase from increased unit volume sales of 4.6% for our vinyl siding products in Canada and a favorable foreign currency impact of $2.2 million. Our improved net sales in the Canadian market continues to reflect the stabilization in the Canadian market despite the challenging conditions that currently exist in Canada from the significant decline in energy prices that have stymied housing and economic development particularly in Western Canada for the last several years.\nOur building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore, single family housing starts commencing in the period from September 2016 to September 2017 directly impacts the demand for our products for the year ended December 31, 2017. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single family housing starts increased 9.6% during this lag affected period reflecting these improved market conditions. Specifically, the heavy vinyl siding geographic areas in the Northeast increased 3.2% while the Midwest increased 9.4% during the lag affected year. In addition to the new construction market improvement, remodeling activity, according to the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity ( LIRA\u201d), reflected the 2017 fourth quarter trailing twelve months increasing 6.6% compared to 2016. However, due to the relative high dollar value or big ticket\u201d nature of our replacement products, we believe that true remodeling market demand for our big ticket exterior products increased approximately 3.0%. Since our Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment is heavily weighted to the repair and remodeling market, we estimate the weighted average U.S. market increase to be 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017, which we exceeded with our 7.0% vinyl siding unit net sales increase in the U.S. for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our 7.0% vinyl siding unit sales increase also exceeded the market indicators as reported by the Vinyl Siding Institute which reported that U.S. vinyl siding industry shipments increased 5.7% during the year. The improved U.S. and Canadian market conditions accounted for the majority of the 9.4% net sales increase achieved during the year ended December 31, 2017, however our sales also benefited from new business wins, which we believe is demonstrated by the improvement in our U.S. market position in vinyl siding, which increased from 39.8% to 40.4% during 2017 relative to 2016, while our share of the Canadian vinyl siding market improved from 31.5% to 32.7% during 2017 relative to 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the percentage of net sales in vinyl siding and metal accessories represented approximately 57.0% and 25.2% and 58.0% and 24.7%, respectively, with our net sales of other products comprising approximately 17.8% and 17.3%, respectively.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $46.7 million or 5.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The net sales increase resulted from a $52.0 million net sales increase or 7.1% in the U.S. market partially offset by a net sales decrease of $5.3 million or 4.9% for the Canadian market. In the U.S. market, the 7.1% net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by improved U.S. market demand for our products, new business wins of approximately $34.0 million, and $11.7 million of net sales attributed to our Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015. Excluding Canyon Stone, our net sales in the U.S. market would have increased 5.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Our net sales growth in the U.S. market resulted from increased unit sales of approximately 10.6% partially offset by lower average selling prices of approximately 4.4% that were reduced in response to lower raw material input costs experienced during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The lower average selling prices for our products negatively impacted our net sales by approximately $35.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The positive demand factors in the U.S. market were partially offset by continued weaker market demand in Canada which when combined with $3.8 million of negative foreign currency resulted in the $5.3 million Canadian net sales decrease. Market demand in Canada has been negatively impacted by the 2016 decline in energy prices, particularly in Western Canada, where housing starts have declined significantly in Alberta (21.0%).\nOur building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore, single family housing starts commencing in the period from September 2015 to September 2016 directly impacts the demand for our products for the year ended December 31, 2016. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single family housing starts increased 9.0% during this lag affected period reflecting the improved market conditions. In addition to the new construction market improvement, remodeling activity, according to the LIRA, reflected the 2016 trailing twelve months increasing 6.0% compared to the 2015 period. However, due to the relative higher dollar value or big ticket\u201d nature of our replacement products, we believe that true remodeling market demand for our big ticket exterior products increased 3.0% to 4.0%. Since our Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment is heavily weighted to the repair and remodeling market, we estimate the weighted average U.S. market repair and remodeling increase to be 5.4% for 2016. Our U.S. unit sales increase of 10.6% outperformed the estimated market increase but was partially offset by our lower average selling prices. The improvement in single family housing starts and remodeling expenditures as well as our ability to exceed these market indicators on a unit basis is evidenced by the Vinyl Siding Institute reporting that U.S. vinyl siding industry shipments increased 5.2% while shipments in Canada decreased 8.5% for 2016 relative to 2015 compared to our vinyl industry shipments increase of 8.1% in the U.S. and our 4.5% decrease in Canada.\nThe improved U.S. market conditions drove our 5.6% net sales increase during the year ended December 31, 2016; however our sales also benefited from new business wins of $34.0 million which we believe is demonstrated by the improvement in our U.S. market position in vinyl siding which increased from 38.8% to 39.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015, while our share of the Canadian vinyl siding market improved from 30.2% to 31.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $11.2 million or 4.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The gross profit decrease resulted from higher raw material input costs that were not fully offset by increased average selling prices, higher freight costs and the near-term negative impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The increased raw material costs were largely related to aluminum and PVC resin which increased 22.2% and 10.3%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016. This unfavorable material cost pricing decreased gross profit by approximately $28.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016. Although we were able to partially offset this $28.6 million with selling price increases of $15.0 million that were implemented during the first and second quarters of 2017, our realization from the early price increases was below expectations due to timing and market acceptance and, as a result, we announced additional price increases during the second quarter of 2017. These additional price increases are expected to improve gross margins during 2018. While historically we have successfully demonstrated our ability to pass along these material cost increases to customers, which enables our gross margins to remain relatively stable over an annualized period, our gross profit margins may be compressed during periods of rising raw material costs and expand as our selling price increases take effect or material inflation abates. In addition to the higher material costs, we also incurred increased freight expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $5.1 million due to a 15.1% increase in diesel costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 as well as limited experienced drivers and route availability which impacted our common carrier cost, as well as higher operating costs relative to the year ended December 31, 2016 that negatively impacted our gross profit. Furthermore, we incurred unfavorable mix from the $25.6 million increase in metal sales during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, which carry lower gross profit margins than vinyl sales. The negative trends within gross profit were partially offset by improved operating metrics within our Canadian business which experienced higher gross profit of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, which can be attributed to higher average selling prices, improved market conditions within Canada that led to unit volume increases, and favorable foreign currency rates.\nIn addition to the higher material, operating, and freight costs as well as unfavorable product mix, our siding, fencing and stone segment was also negatively impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma by approximately $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Hurricane Harvey's torrential rainfall and flooding of the Houston, Texas area negatively impacted our raw material sourcing with two of the four domestic PVC resin producers declaring force majeure\u201d. In addition, we incurred higher freight charges related to moving our existing supply of PVC resin between our plants because of the temporary PVC resin shortage in the Houston chemical market which supplies a significant percentage of the total U.S. PVC resin market. Since Hurricanes Harvey and Irma occurred on August 24th and September 10th, respectively, the negative impact from these storms commenced during the later portion of our third quarter but permeated into our fourth quarter as well from continued negative raw material pricing, sourcing and freight costs. Overall, our gross profit declined during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 despite volume increases and higher average selling prices as they were fully offset by higher material, freight, and operating costs.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased from 29.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 25.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 370 basis point decrease for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from increased raw material costs primarily for aluminum and PVC resin that were not fully offset during 2017 by increased selling prices. Also, our sales of our metal accessories, which typically carry lower gross profit margins, outpaced our vinyl siding sales, that resulted in a negative product mix impact on our gross profit percentage. In addition, our gross profit margins were unfavorably impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma as well as higher operating and freight costs experienced during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $21.2 million or 8.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The gross profit increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily resulted from the 5.6% net sales increase and included approximately $3.4 million of gross profit from our Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015. Excluding Canyon Stone, our gross profit increase would have been $17.8 million or 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOverall, the higher sales volumes experienced during 2016 in the U.S. market of 5.5% enabled us to increase our operating leverage and gross profit relative to 2015. In addition, we experienced favorable material cost pricing during the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015 specifically for aluminum and PVC resin. This favorable net material cost pricing favorably impacted gross profit by approximately $33.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015, but was offset by $35.2 million of lower net selling prices that were reduced as a result of lower material costs. In addition, our Canadian gross profit declined 12.7% or $4.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $3.0 million as well as the declining Canadian economic conditions prevalent in Western Canada which are heavily dependent on energy prices to sustain their economy partially offset by favorable material costing of $0.9 million.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 28.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 29.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 excluding the impact of the Canyon Stone acquisition. The 90 basis point increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted mainly from improved operating leverage from the 5.6% net sales increase as well as favorable material cost pricing and freight expense partially offset by lower average sales prices, an unfavorable foreign currency impact from a weakening Canadian dollar as well as weakening demand in Canada due to the economic slowdown.\nSG&A Expense\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased from the year ended December 31, 2016 by approximately $2.8 million or 3.2%. The $2.8 million SG&A expense increase resulted from $2.9 million in higher selling and marketing expenses related to the 9.4% net sales increase, $0.9 million in higher legal and professional expenses, $0.7 million in unfavorable workers compensation expenses, $0.2 million in higher research and development expenses, and $0.5 million in increased SG&A expenses for the stone business partially offset by lower management compensation expense of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense decreased 60 basis points from 10.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the lower management compensation expense and improved operating leverage related to the net sales increase.\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased from the year ended December 31, 2015 by approximately $1.1 million or 1.2%. Excluding the impact of the Canyon Stone acquisition which was completed on May 29, 2015 and incurred SG&A expense of approximately $2.6 million, SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $3.7 million or 4.0% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. SG&A expense decreased primarily due to lower sales and marketing spending that resulted from our initiative to better leverage our marketing resources. The success of these initiatives is demonstrated with the SG&A expense reduction while achieving $34.0 million in market share gains during 2016.\nAs a percentage of net sales excluding Canyon Stone, SG&A expense decreased from 10.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 10.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease reflects improved leverage on the fixed component of our SG&A expenses relative to the net sales increase as well as the impact of certain sales and marketing cost initiatives which resulted in our sales and marketing expenses decreasing $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased approximately $3.8 million or 29.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to certain customer relationship intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net sales, amortization expense decreased to 0.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 1.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2015 at approximately $12.7 million and 1.4% of net sales relative to $12.9 million and 1.5% of net sales, respectively.\nCurrency Transaction Gain (Loss)\nA currency transaction impact was established in 2013 with the acquisition of Mitten within the Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment. The currency transaction gain for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.3 million. The currency transaction gain for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.2 million and for the year ended December 31, 2015 was a transaction loss of $1.0 million related to the Mitten entity. The $1.2 million increase in the foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to the positive movement in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWindows and Doors Segment\n\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $61.1 million or 6.0% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The 6.0% net sales increase resulted from improved U.S. and Canadian market demand conditions, which primarily favorably impacted our new construction. For the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 our U.S. new construction business increased $54.1 million or 8.3% due in part to higher average selling prices of 2.7% and our U.S. repair and remodeling business decreased $11.4 million or 4.1% from lower unit volume sales of 1.9% partially offset by higher average selling prices of 3.9%. Our Canadian net sales increased $18.4 million or 19.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an improving Western Canadian market which culminated in a unit volume increase of 14.1% and a favorable foreign currency impact of $2.1 million. Our Western Canada sales have been impacted by depressed market conditions that resulted from the significant decline in energy prices that have stymied housing and economic development in Western Canada, however recently we have begun to see some recovery in those markets.\nThe net sales increase for the U.S. market can be attributed to improved market conditions as evidenced by the U.S. Census Bureau reporting that single family housing starts increased 9.6% during the lag effected period which resulted in higher net sales for our new construction business. Our building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore single family starts commencing in the period from September 2016 to September 2017 directly impacts the demand for our products for the year ended December 31, 2017. For the repair and remodeling business, LIRA reported that the 2017 trailing twelve months increased 6.6% compared to the 2016 period creating a favorable demand environment. However, due to the relative high dollar value or big ticket\u201d nature of our replacement products, we believe that true remodeling market demand for our big ticket exterior products increased approximately 3.0%. Our vinyl unit net sales for new construction increased 4.4% which was less than the 9.6% new construction market increase while our repair and remodeling unit sales decreased 1.9% which was lower than the repair and remodeling demand market indicators for the year ended December 31, 2017. The lower unit volumes for new construction relative to market indicators resulted from our ability to realize higher average selling prices on our products combined with aggressive price action taken by certain competitors which suppressed our market gains. The lower unit volumes relative to the overall market for our repair and remodeling window products was caused by acquisition integration activities for certain customers, which adversely impacted unit volumes in certain geographic areas. In addition, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma negatively impacted our ability to ship product to significant markets in Houston and Florida for certain days in late third quarter and early fourth quarter resulting in estimated lost net sales of approximately $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Despite these lower net sales amounts relative to demand market indicators for our new construction and repair and remodeling businesses, we achieved an overall 6.0% net sales increase due in part to higher average selling prices of 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. These higher average selling prices increased our U.S. and Canadian net sales by approximately $30.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $25.4 million or 2.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 can be attributed to the improved U.S. market conditions favorably impacting both our new construction business as well as our repair and remodeling business. For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, our new construction business increased $38.7 million or 6.7% while our repair and remodeling business increased $6.1 million or 2.0%. This U.S. net sales increase was partially offset by a $19.4 million net sales decline or 17.0% for our Canadian net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to a weakening Canadian market.\nThe net sales increase for the U.S. market can be attributed to improved market conditions as evidenced by the U.S. Census Bureau reporting that single family housing starts increased 9.0% during the lag effected period which resulted in higher net sales for our new construction products. Our building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore single family starts commencing in the period from September 2015 to September 2016 directly impacts the demand for our products for the year ended December 31, 2016. As previously mentioned, we believe that true market demand for big ticket repair and remodeling products increased 3.0% to 4.0%. Our net sales for new construction and repair and remodeling were lower than the demand market indicators for the year ended December 31, 2016 due primarily to lower sales in certain geographical areas, namely Texas, specifically Houston, due to extraordinary levels of rainfall which negatively impacted the construction industry and economic conditions in the Houston market related to the oil and gas industry. Our net sales of window products in the Houston market declined $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition to Houston, we incurred lost sales in our repair and remodeling business of $11.3 million and $2.2 million in our new construction business from competitive price action taken by certain competitors in other geographic regions in which we maintained our pricing discipline in the marketplace.\nDespite these lower net sales amounts relative to demand market indicators for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, we achieved higher average selling prices of 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. These higher average selling prices increased our U.S. net sales by approximately $26.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The overall U.S. net sales increase of $44.8 million was partially offset by a $19.4 million or 17.0% net sales decline for our Western Canadian business which endured challenging market conditions negatively impacted by demand softness due to declining energy prices and poor economic growth as well as a negative foreign currency impact of $3.1 million.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $17.5 or 8.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The gross profit increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from the continued improvement in our new construction business partially offset by declining gross profit performance for our repair and remodeling business within the U.S. while our Canadian business experienced improved gross profit of $5.9 million relative to the prior year period. Gross profit for our U.S. new construction business increased $12.7 million while our repair and remodeling gross profit declined $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The gross profit net improvement for our U.S. businesses was driven by increased selling prices of 3.1%, improved operating efficiencies and favorable product mix, which improved gross profit by $30.8 million partially offset by lower gross margins within our repair and remodeling business which experienced reduced unit volumes during the year decreasing our manufacturing operating leverage. Our Canadian business also experienced favorable pricing of $3.2 million from higher average selling prices for the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016. These factors coupled with improved manufacturing leverage from the unit volume increases and a favorable foreign currency impact of $0.5 million enabled our Canadian business to realize improved gross profit of $5.9 million despite the challenging economic and demand conditions that exist in Western Canada due to lower energy prices. For the Windows and Doors segment, we achieved higher average selling prices during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 from announced price increases implemented to offset the aforementioned raw material cost increases for aluminum and PVC resin as well as glass costs. These higher material costs negatively impacted our gross profit by approximately $14.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition to the higher material costs, we also incurred increased freight expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017 of $4.0 million due to a 15% increase in diesel costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 as well as limited experienced drivers and route availability which impacted our common carrier cost.\nIn addition to the higher material and freight costs, our gross profit was negatively impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma during the year ended December 31, 2017. We incurred lost sales of approximately $10.0 million with an estimated gross profit of approximately $2.8 million from the hurricanes impacting our significant new construction and repair and remodeling window markets in Florida and Houston as well as higher material costs of approximately $1.1 million and higher freight expenses of approximately $0.6 million from moving our existing supply of PVC resin between our plants because of the temporary shortages in the Houston area. Since Hurricanes Harvey and Irma occurred on August 24th and September 10th, respectively, the negative impact from these storms commenced during the later portion of our third quarter but permeated into our fourth quarter as well from continued negative raw material pricing, sourcing, and freight costs. Overall, our net sales increase of 6.0% achieved through improved market conditions and higher selling prices was mitigated by higher material costs and the negative hurricane impact resulting in a gross profit improvement of 8.6% during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 19.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 20.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 50 basis point increase in gross profit reflects improvements of 110 basis points for our U.S. new construction businesses and 190 basis points for our Canadian business partially offset by an 80 basis point deterioration in our repair and remodeling business due to lower operating leverage on reduced unit sales volume. These net gross margin improvements resulted from improved demand levels and higher average selling prices partially offset by rising material costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $21.4 or 11.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The gross profit increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily resulted from the continued improvement in our new construction and repair and remodeling businesses partially offset by the negative impact from lower net sales in Canada. Gross profit for our U.S. new construction and repair and remodeling business increased $16.1 million and $6.9 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The gross profit improvement for our U.S. businesses was driven by increased selling prices of 3.3%, favorable product mix and lower raw material costs and cost savings and synergies that were realized from our Simonton acquisition. These favorable factors were partially offset by higher costs in our U.S. new construction window business related to labor and freight. These overall net gross profit improvements in the U.S. were partially offset by a gross profit decrease of $1.6 million for our Western Canadian business which experienced weaker market demand due to depressed economic conditions including a negative foreign currency impact of $4.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 18.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 19.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The 170 basis point gross profit increase reflects improvements for both our U.S. new construction and repair and remodeling window businesses from improved demand levels, higher average selling prices, and favorable material costs partially offset by a decrease for our Canadian business driven by the 17.0% net sales decrease which decreased operating leverage during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nSG&A Expense\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $4.6 million or 3.2% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The $4.6 million SG&A expense increase primarily resulted from increased selling and marketing expenses of $2.0 million related to the net sales increase of 6.0% and higher bad debt expense of $1.3 million. In addition, we experienced a favorable $1.3 million movement for a severance accrual reversal during the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense decreased 30 basis points from 14.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 14.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $3.9 million or 2.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The SG&A expense decrease was attributable primarily to 2015 activity for acquisition integration and restructuring activities related to our repair and remodeling window acquisition which originally occurred in September 2014 as well as combining our Canadian window manufacturing facilities into a single facility. Specifically, our U.S. window repair and remodeling business incurred lower severance expenses of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, our U.S. window businesses experienced $5.0 million in lower management incentive compensation and lower sales and marketing expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 partially offset by increased legal fees of approximately $2.8 million primarily related to legal settlements completed in December 2016 and January 2017 as well as increased legal expense associated with the 2015 resolution of class action litigation for our new construction business of $3.2 million. Our Canadian window business experienced lower restructuring and integration charges of $2.2 million, as well as lower personnel costs of $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the economic slowdown with lower demand levels as well as integration activities that occurred during 2015 finalizing our combination of our Western Canadian manufacturing facilities into a single location in Alberta.\nAs a percentage of net sales, SG&A expense decreased from 15.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 14.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The 80 basis point decrease primarily resulted from lower severance expense for our U.S. repair and remodeling window business, lower management compensation expense, lower selling and marketing expenses partially offset by increased legal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, our Canadian window business incurred lower restructuring and personnel expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 from integration activities that were incurred during 2015 finalizing our combination our manufacturing operations into a single location in Alberta.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2016 at $12.3 million and 1.1% of net sales and $12.3 million and 1.2% of net sales, respectively. Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2015 at $12.3 million and 1.2% of net sales and $12.4 million and 1.2% of net sales, respectively.\nCurrency Transaction Gain (Loss)\nThe currency transaction gain for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.1 million increasing $1.0 million from a gain of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the fluctuation in the Canadian dollar as compared to the U.S. dollar for 2017. The currency transaction gain for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.1 million increasing $2.3 million from a loss of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the fluctuation in the Canadian dollar as compared to the U.S. dollar for 2016. Our Gienow acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2013, increased our transactional exposure to the Canadian currency. Management continues to evaluate methodologies to effectively hedge this foreign currency risk.\nUnallocated Operating Earnings, Interest, and (Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes \nOperating loss/SG&A Expense\nUnallocated SG&A expense includes items which are not directly attributed to or allocated to either of our reporting segments. Such items include legal costs, corporate payroll, and unallocated finance and accounting expenses. The unallocated operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $3.2 million or 10.0% compared to the same period in 2016 due to decreased management incentive compensation of $3.9 million and lower stock compensation expense of $0.6 million partially offset by increased centralization activities of certain functional areas such as research and development ($0.1 million) and marketing ($0.3 million), along with an increase various other professional fees and personnel expenses of ($0.9 million).\nThe unallocated operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $1.8 million or 6.0% compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to increased centralization of certain functional areas such as research and development ($1.0 million), marketing ($1.0 million), and information technology ($0.7 million) along with increased incentive compensation of approximately $0.4 million partially offset by decreases in stock compensation expense of $0.9 million and various other professional fees and personnel expenses of $0.4 million. One element that drove the increased research and development expense within the unallocated segment was the opening of the Insight Center in Durham, NC during 2016, a facility that supports product development and innovation.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by approximately $3.4 million or 4.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the reduction in the Term Loan Facility principal balance year over year. During March, August and November 2016, we made a total of $160.0 million in voluntary payments on the Term Loan Facility and another $40.0 million voluntary payment on the Term Loan Facility was made in November 2017, in addition to our normal quarterly amortization payments of $1.1 million, or $4.3 million annually, which reduced our outstanding borrowings and our annual interest expense.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by approximately $2.1 million or 2.9% compared to the same period in 2015 as a result of the reduction in the Term Loan Facility principal balance year over year and lower average borrowings on the ABL Facility year over year. During 2016, we made $160.0 million of voluntary payments on the Term Loan Facility in addition to our normal quarterly amortization payments of $1.1 million, or $4.3 million annually, which reduced our outstanding borrowings and our annual interest expense.\nInterest income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was consistent with the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nTax receivable agreement liability adjustment\nSince the inception of the TRA liability with the Company's 2013 initial public offering, we have historically been in a full valuation allowance for federal purposes and a partial valuation allowance for certain state and Canadian jurisdictions. As a result of the Company's tax valuation allowance position for federal and state purposes, we historically calculated the TRA liability considering (i) current year taxable income only (due to the uncertainty of future taxable income associated with our previous cumulative loss position) and (ii) future income due to the expected reversals of deferred tax liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we released our federal valuation allowance and a portion of our state valuation allowance for $55.2 million, due to positive factors outweighing negative evidence, specifically no longer being in a cumulative loss position. The factors surrounding the release of this valuation allowance thereby eliminated any uncertainty as to future taxable income. Consequently, we were able to utilize future forecasts of taxable income beyond the 2016 tax year to determine the TRA liability as of December 31, 2016. Our future taxable income estimates were used to determine the cumulative net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\") that are expected to be utilized and the TRA liability was accordingly adjusted using the 85% TRA rate. As a result of including future taxable income beyond 2016, we recognized a $60.9 million adjustment to the TRA liability during the year ended December 31, 2016 bringing the total TRA liability to $79.7 million as of December 31, 2016.\nThe TRA liability as of December 31, 2017 was $69.5 million. This amount represents the originally anticipated TRA liability at the IPO date with approximately $5.2 million remaining to be expensed through operations for state purposes as we remain in a state tax valuation allowance position as of December 31, 2017 for certain states. This remaining liability will be recognized as the state valuation allowances are released in future years. The $10.2 million decrease in the TRA liability for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted primarily from a $10.7 million decrease for the reduction in the future federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% due to the enactment of the Tax Act on December 22, 2017, which reduces the value of the NOLs to be utilized in future periods. The $10.7 million was partially offset by $0.5 million of imputed interest accrual related to the 2016 TRA payment.\nThe $47.9 million increase for the TRA liability adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2016 relative to the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted primarily from the $55.2 million discrete federal valuation allowance release along with our ability to utilize future forecasts of taxable income beyond the 2016 tax year to determine the TRA liability as of December 31, 2016, as described above.\nThe $12.9 million TRA liability adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from increases in taxable income estimates resulting from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities as well as increases in our 2015 taxable income compared to the 2014 period. The $115.9 million increase in our 2015 taxable income can be attributed to the following factors (i) the continued U.S. housing recovery which is estimated to have had a 10.0% year over year increase in single family housing starts according to the U.S. Census Bureau, (ii) improvements in the repair and remodeling market evidenced by the 5.6% increase in homeowner improvements during 2015 versus 2014 according to LIRA, (iii) the positive income contributions from our acquisition of Simonton which was completed in September 2014, and (iv) continued improvements in our existing operations specifically for our U.S. windows business which increased its operating earnings by approximately $45.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. All of these items increased our taxable income estimate for the year ended December 31, 2015 and, as a result, our estimate of the TRA liability.\nLoss on modification or extinguishment of debt\nDuring November 2017, we voluntarily paid $40.0 million on the Term Loan Facility to reduce our outstanding indebtedness as allowable under the terms of the agreement governing the Term Loan Facility. We performed an analysis to determine the proper accounting treatment for this voluntary payment by evaluating the change in cash flows and determining that there were no changes in the creditors as a result of the payment. Consequently, we recognized a loss on debt modification or extinguishment of approximately $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisting of the proportionate write off of the related debt issuance costs and debt discount.\nDuring 2016, we voluntarily paid $160.0 million on the Term Loan Facility to reduce our outstanding indebtedness as allowable under the terms of the agreement governing the Term Loan Facility. We performed an analysis to determine the proper accounting treatment for these voluntary payments by evaluating the change in cash flows and determining that there were no changes in the creditors as a result of the payment. Consequently, we recognized a loss on debt modification or extinguishment of approximately $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisting of the proportionate write off of the related debt issuance costs and debt discount.\nIncome taxes\nThe income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $98.6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily related to an increase in pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the reversal of the valuation allowance for federal and certain state jurisdictions during the year ended December 31, 2016. The income tax provision of approximately $46.7 million is comprised of $40.7 million of federal tax expense, $6.5 million of state tax expense, and a $0.5 million foreign income tax benefit. Our pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $115.0 million including the $10.7 million Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment compared to pre-tax income of $23.5 million including the $60.9 million Tax Receivable Agreement liability adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we remain in a valuation allowance position for certain state and Canadian jurisdictions.\nThe income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to an approximate $52.0 million tax benefit compared to an approximate $0.7 million tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015. The income tax benefit of approximately $52.0 million is comprised of $53.6 million of federal tax benefit, $2.6 million state tax expense, and $1.0 million foreign income tax benefit. The increase in tax benefit is primarily due to the release of the discrete valuation allowance of $55.2 million partially offset by state income tax, remaining valuation allowances, and foreign income taxes. Our pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $23.5 million including the $60.9 million tax receivable agreement liability adjustment compared to pre-tax income of $31.6 million including the $12.9 million tax receivable agreement liability adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, makes broad and complex changes to the Code including, but not limited to, reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations, eliminating the corporate AMT and changing how existing AMT credits can be realized, creating the BEAT, creating a general limitation on deductible interest expense, and changing rules related to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years after December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, as a result of the corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 enacted in the Tax Act, we recorded an expense of $4.3 million due to the re-measurement of the deferred tax assets at the reduced income tax rate which reduced the future benefit we will realize associated with these assets. This expense has been recognized in income taxes within our consolidated statement of operations.\nASC 740 Income Taxes requires a company to record the effects of a tax law change in the period of enactment. Due to the complexities involved in accounting for the recently enacted Tax Act, SAB 118 requires that we include in our financial statements a reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimate has been determined. Accordingly, we have performed an earnings and profits analysis associated with the one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result of accumulated losses, there will be no income tax effect recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 based on the reasonable estimate guidance provided by SAB 118. We are continuing to assess the impact from the Tax Act and may record further adjustments in 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n2015 Debt Transaction\nOn November 5, 2015, Ply Gem Industries entered into a second amended and restated ABL Facility. Among other things, the second amended and restated ABL Facility: (i) increased the overall facility to $350.0 million, (ii) provided an accordion feature of $50.0 million, and (iii) established the applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility to a range of 1.25% to 2.00% for Eurodollar rate loans, depending on availability. All outstanding loans under the second amended and restated ABL Facility are due and payable in full on November 5, 2020.\nGeneral cash flow movements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents increased to $71.4 million compared to approximately $51.6 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase in cash was driven by a $5.8 million improvement in operating earnings, $5.0 million lower TRA payments and $120.0 million less in voluntary payments on the Term Loan Facility in 2017 versus 2016 partially offset by $43.1 million lower operating cash flow. The improved operating performance was offset by a $38.1 million increase in working capital during the year ended December 31, 2017 relative to the year ended December 31, 2016. Accounts receivable increased $24.7 million and inventory increased $22.9 million offset by a $9.5 million improvement in trade payables during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016. The approximate $24.7 million accounts receivable increase from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 resulted primarily from the increase in December sales year over year. The net sales for December 2017 were approximately $177.4 million and the net sales for December 2016 were approximately $152.2 million. The approximate $22.9 million inventory increase from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 resulted from higher raw material costs in 2017 combined with higher inventory levels at December 31, 2017 in anticipation of higher sales volumes in 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately $57.8 million to $51.6 million as of December 31, 2016.\nOur business is seasonal because inclement weather during the winter months reduces the level of building and remodeling activity in both the home repair and remodeling and the new home construction sectors, especially in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States and Canada. As a result, our liquidity typically increases during the second and third quarters as our borrowing base increases under the ABL Facility reaching a peak early in the fourth quarter, and decreases late in the fourth quarter and throughout the first quarter.\nOur primary cash needs are for working capital, capital expenditures and debt service. Our annual cash interest charges for debt service under the current organizational structure, including the ABL Facility, are estimated to be approximately $54.0 million for fiscal year 2018. As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any scheduled debt maturities until 2020. The specific debt instruments and their corresponding terms and due dates are described in the following sections. Our capital expenditures have historically averaged approximately 1.5% to 2.0% of net sales on an annual basis. For the year ending December 31, 2018, we estimate that our capital expenditures will be in a range from 2.00% to 2.25% of net sales. We finance these cash requirements through internally generated cash flow and funds borrowed under Ply Gem Industries' ABL Facility.\nPly Gem's specific cash flow movement for the year ended December 31, 2017 is summarized below:\nCash provided by operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $101.9 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $145.0 million, and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $139.4 million. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2017 was driven by improved housing conditions that drove the 7.6% net sales increase offset by decreases in cash flows related to our working capital increase as a result of the net sales increase, rising commodity costs, and our aggressiveness in taking early pay discounts. These conditions resulted in an unfavorable $38.1 million impact in our primary working capital for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe relative consistency in net cash provided by operating activities between 2016 and 2015 was primarily driven by the $43.2 million increase in net income during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 partially offset by the $40.1 million working capital increase.\nCash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was approximately $37.9 million, $35.8 million, and $54.7 million, respectively. The cash used in investing activities during 2017 was primarily for capital expenditures which were approximately 2.0%, consistent with our historical average. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company sold a building in Saskatoon, Canada for approximately $2.1 million. The Company moved to another leased facility within the Saskatoon area that more closely aligns with the Company's needs in that area.\nThe cash used in investing activities during 2016 was primarily for capital expenditures on numerous ongoing capital projects across all business segments. Capital expenditures for 2016 were approximately 1.9% of net sales, consistent with our historical average.\nThe cash used in investing activities in 2015 was primarily for the acquisition of Canyon Stone and capital expenditures on various ongoing capital projects. The Canyon Stone acquisition was approximately $21.0 million net of cash acquired. Capital expenditures for 2015 were approximately 1.8% of net sales, consistent with our historical average.\nCash used in financing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $44.3 million, primarily from the $40.0 million voluntary Term Loan Facility payment made in November 2017, the 1.0% principal repayment of $4.3 million required by the Term Loan Facility, and $1.2 million in tax withholding related to employee stock grant issuances. These payments were offset by $1.2 million in cash provided by the exercise of stock options.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $168.2 million, primarily from the three separate voluntary Term Loan Facility payments that totaled $160.0 million and the 1.0% principal repayment of $4.3 million required by the Term Loan Facility and the Tax Receivable Agreement payment of $5.0 million. These payments were offset by $1.1 million in cash provided by the exercise of stock options.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $3.6 million, primarily related to the 1.0% principal repayment of $4.3 million required by the Term Loan Facility and the payment of $1.4 million in debt issuance costs. These payments were offset by $2.2 million in cash provided by the exercise of stock options.\nPly Gem's specific debt instruments and terms are described below:\n6.50% Senior Notes due 2022\nOn January 30, 2014, Ply Gem Industries issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes at par. On September 19, 2014, Ply Gem Industries issued an additional $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes (the \"Senior Tack-on Notes\") at an issue price of 93.25%. Interest accrues at 6.50% per annum and is paid semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The 6.50% Senior Notes will mature on February 1, 2022. At any time on or after February 1, 2017, Ply Gem Industries may redeem the 6.50% Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at declining redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 6.50% Senior Notes plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The effective interest rate for the 6.50% Senior Notes is 8.39% after considering each of the different interest expense components of this instrument, including the coupon payment and the deferred debt issuance costs.\nThe 6.50% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Ply Gem Holdings and all of the wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of Ply Gem Industries (the Guarantors\u201d). The indenture governing the 6.50% Senior Notes contains certain covenants that limit the ability of Ply Gem Industries and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem their stock, make loans and investments, sell assets, incur certain liens, enter into agreements restricting their ability to pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates, and consolidate, merge or sell assets. In particular, Ply Gem Industries and its restricted subsidiaries may not incur additional debt (other than permitted debt (as defined in the indenture) in limited circumstances) unless, after giving effect to such incurrence, the consolidated interest coverage ratio of Ply Gem Industries would be at least 2.00 to 1.00.\nIn the absence of satisfying the consolidated interest coverage ratio test, Ply Gem Industries and its restricted subsidiaries may only incur additional debt under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, debt under credit facilities (as defined in the indenture) (x) in an amount not to exceed the greater of (a) $350.0 million and (b) the borrowing base (as defined in the indenture) and (y) in an amount not to exceed the greater of (A) $575.0 million and (B) the aggregate amount of indebtedness (as defined in the indenture) that that would cause the consolidated secured debt ratio (as defined in the indenture) to be equal to 4.00 to 1.00; purchase money indebtedness in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $35.0 million and (y) 10% of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the indenture) at any one time outstanding; debt of foreign subsidiaries in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $60.0 million and (y) 15% of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the indenture) at any one time outstanding; debt pursuant to a general basket in an aggregate amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the greater of (x) $75.0 million and (y) 20% of consolidated net tangible assets; and the refinancing of debt under certain circumstances.\nOn September 5, 2014, Ply Gem Industries completed an exchange offer with respect to the 6.50% Senior Notes issued in January 2014 to exchange $500.0 million 6.50% Senior Notes registered under the Securities Act for $500.0 million of the issued and outstanding 6.50% Senior Notes. Upon completion of the exchange offer, all $500.0 million of issued and outstanding 6.50% Senior Notes were registered under the Securities Act. On January 23, 2015, Ply Gem Industries completed an exchange offer with respect to the Senior Tack-on Notes issued in September 2014 to exchange $150.0 million Senior Tack-on Notes registered under the Securities Act for $150.0 million of the issued and outstanding Senior Tack-on Notes. Upon completion of the exchange offer, all $150.0 million of issued and outstanding Senior Tack-on Notes were registered under the Securities Act.\nTerm Loan Facility due 2021\nOn January 30, 2014, Ply Gem Industries entered into a credit agreement governing the terms of its $430.0 million Term Loan Facility. Ply Gem Industries originally borrowed $430.0 million under the Term Loan Facility on January 30, 2014, with an original discount of approximately $2.2 million, yielding proceeds of approximately $427.9 million. The Term Loan Facility will mature on January 30, 2021. The Term Loan Facility requires scheduled quarterly payments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.00% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan Facility with the balance due at maturity. Interest on outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility is paid quarterly.\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at Ply Gem Industries' option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the prime rate of the administrative agent under the credit agreement, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (iii) the adjusted LIBO rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00% or (b) a LIBO rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for eurocurrency deposits in dollars for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a 1.00% floor, plus, in each case, an applicable margin of 3.00% for any eurocurrency loan and 2.00% for any alternate base rate loan. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was 4.00%. The effective interest rate for the Term Loan is 8.60% after considering each of the different interest expense components of this instrument, including the coupon payment, the deferred debt issuance costs and the original issue discount.\nThe Term Loan Facility allows Ply Gem Industries to request one or more incremental term loan facilities in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $140.0 million and (y) an amount such that Ply Gem Industries' consolidated senior secured debt ratio (as defined in the credit agreement), on a pro forma basis, does not exceed 3.75 to 1.00, in each case, subject to certain conditions and receipt of commitments by existing or additional financial institutions or institutional lenders.\nThe Term Loan Facility requires Ply Gem Industries to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with: (i) 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% if our consolidated senior secured debt ratio is equal or less than 2.50 to 1.00 but greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and to 0% if our consolidated senior secured debt ratio is equal to or less than 2.00 to 1.00) of our annual excess cash flow (as defined in the credit agreement), to the extent such excess cash flow exceeds $15.0 million, commencing with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015; (ii) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or certain insurance and condemnation proceeds, in each case subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights; and (iii) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain issuances of debt, other than proceeds from debt permitted under the Term Loan Facility. Ply Gem Industries may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Term Loan Facility at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage\u201d costs with respect to LIBOR loans. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's consolidated senior secured debt ratio was 0.66 and as a result no excess cash flow payment under the Term Loan Facility will be required. However, we elected on November 3, 2017 to voluntarily prepay $40.0 million on the Term Loan Facility to reduce our outstanding indebtedness bringing our cumulative voluntary 2016 and 2017 Term Loan Facility payments to $200.0 million as we elected on March 10, 2016 and August 4, 2016 to voluntarily prepay $30.0 million on each date and elected on November 4, 2016 to voluntarily pay an additional $100.0 million on the Term Loan Facility.\nThe Term Loan Facility is secured on a first-priority lien basis by the stock of Ply Gem Industries and by substantially all of the assets (other than the assets securing the obligations under the ABL Facility, which primarily consist of accounts receivable, inventory, cash, deposit accounts, securities accounts, chattel paper, contract rights, instruments, documents related thereto and proceeds of the foregoing) of Ply Gem Industries and the Guarantors that are subsidiaries of Ply Gem Industries and on a second-priority lien basis by the assets that secure the ABL Facility.\nThe Term Loan Facility includes negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, that are substantially the same as the negative covenants in the 6.50% Senior Notes but does not contain any restrictive financial covenants. The Term Loan Facility also restricts the ability of Ply Gem Industries' subsidiaries to enter into agreements restricting their ability to grant liens to secure the Term Loan Facility and contains a restriction on changes in fiscal year.\nSenior Secured Asset Based Revolving Credit Facility due 2020\nOn November 5, 2015, Ply Gem Holdings, Inc., Ply Gem Industries, Inc., Gienow Canada Inc., and Mitten Inc. (together with Gienow, the Canadian Borrowers\u201d) entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement governing the ABL Facility. Among other things, the second amendment and restatement of the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility: (i) increased the overall facility to $350.0 million from $300.0 million, (ii) established an accordion feature of $50.0 million, (iii) reduced the applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility to a range from 1.25% to 2.00% for Eurodollar rate loans, depending on availability, and (iv) extended the maturity until November 5, 2020. Under the ABL Facility, $300.0 million is available to Ply Gem Industries and $50.0 million is available to the Canadian Borrowers. The following summary describes the ABL Facility after giving effect to the amendment and restatement. As a result of the ABL Facility amendment in which the loan syndication consisted of previous members who either maintained or increased their position as well as new syndication members, the Company capitalized new debt issuance costs of $1.5 million and amortizes these costs through 2020.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at Ply Gem Industries' option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the corporate base rate of the administrative agent under the ABL Facility and (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (b) a Eurodollar rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, in each case plus an applicable margin. The initial applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility was 0.50% for base rate loans and 1.50% for Eurodollar rate loans. The applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility is subject to step ups and step downs based on average excess availability under the ABL Facility. Swingline loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the base rate plus the applicable margin.\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the ABL Facility, Ply Gem Industries is required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder, which fee will be determined based on utilization of the ABL Facility (increasing when utilization is low and decreasing when utilization is high) multiplied by a commitment fee rate determined by reference to average excess availability under the ABL Facility. The commitment fee rate during any fiscal quarter is 0.375% when average excess availability is greater than $100.0 million for the preceding fiscal quarter and 0.25% when average availability is less than or equal to $100.0 million for the preceding fiscal quarter. Ply Gem Industries must also pay customary letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin on Eurodollar loans and agency fees. As of December 31, 2017, our interest rate on the ABL Facility was approximately 2.56%. The ABL Facility requires that if (a) excess availability is less than the greater of (x) 10.0% of the lower of the borrowing base and the aggregate commitments and (y) $25.0 million or (b) any event of default has occurred and is continuing, Ply Gem Industries must comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test of 1.0 to 1.0. If the excess availability under the ABL Facility is less than the greater of (a) 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the aggregate commitments and (b) $30.0 million ($27.5 million for the months of January, February, March and April) for a period of 5 consecutive days or an event of default has occurred and is continuing, all cash from Ply Gem Industries material deposit accounts (including all concentration accounts) will be swept daily into a collection account controlled by the administrative agent under the ABL Facility and used to repay outstanding loans and cash collateralize letters of credit.\nAll obligations under the ABL Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by Ply Gem Holdings and substantially all of Ply Gem Industries' existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. All obligations under the ABL Facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the assets of Ply Gem Industries and the guarantors, including a first-priority security interest in personal property consisting of accounts receivable, inventory, cash, deposit accounts, and certain related assets and proceeds of the foregoing and a second-priority security interest in, and mortgages on, substantially all of Ply Gem Industries' and the Guarantors' material owned real property and equipment and all assets that secure the Term Loan Facility on a first-priority basis. In addition to being secured by the collateral securing the obligations of Ply Gem Industries under the domestic collateral package, the obligations of the Canadian Borrowers, which are borrowers under the Canadian sub-facility under the ABL Facility, are also secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of such Canadian subsidiaries, plus additional mortgages in Canada, and a pledge by Ply Gem Industries of the remaining 35% of the equity interests of the Canadian Borrowers pledged only to secure the Canadian sub-facility.\nThe ABL Facility contains certain covenants that limit Ply Gem Industries' ability and the ability of Ply Gem Industries' subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem their stock, make loans and investments, sell assets, incur certain liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, and consolidate, merge or sell assets.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Ply Gem Industries had approximately $340.3 million of contractual availability and approximately $261.5 million of borrowing base availability under the ABL Facility, reflecting $0.0 million of borrowings outstanding and approximately $9.7 million of letters of credit and priority payables reserves.\nLoss on debt modification or extinguishment\nDuring both March and August 2016, the Company made voluntarily payments of $30.0 million on the Term Loan Facility to reduce its outstanding indebtedness as allowable under the terms of the agreement governing the Term Loan Facility and further elected in November 2016 to voluntarily pay an additional $100.0 million on the Term Loan Facility bringing the cumulative 2016 voluntary payments to $160.0 million. The Company performed an analysis to determine the proper accounting treatment for each of these voluntary payments by evaluating the change in cash flows and determined that there were no changes in creditors as a result of the payments. Consequently, the Company recognized a loss on debt modification in the consolidated statement of operations of approximately $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting the proportionate write-off of the related debt discount ($9.4 million) and debt issuance costs ($2.4 million) associated with the $160.0 million in voluntary payments, as summarized in the table below.\nDuring November 2017, we made a voluntarily payment of $40.0 million on the Term Loan Facility to reduce our outstanding indebtedness as allowable under the terms of the agreement governing the Term Loan Facility. We performed an analysis to determine the proper accounting treatment for each of these voluntary payments by evaluating the change in cash flows and determined that there were no changes in creditors as a result of the payments. Consequently, we recognized a loss on debt modification in the consolidated statement of operations of approximately $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, reflecting the proportionate write-off of the related debt discount ($1.7 million) and debt issuance costs ($0.4 million) associated with this $40.0 million voluntary payment, as summarized in the table below.\nBased on these financing transactions, we recognized a loss on debt modification or extinguishment of approximately $2.1 million, $11.7 million and $0.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, as summarized in the table below.\n\nLiquidity requirements\nWe intend to fund our ongoing capital and working capital requirements, including our internal growth, through a combination of cash flows from operations and, if necessary, from borrowings under our ABL Facility. We believe that we will continue to meet our liquidity requirements over the next 12 months. We believe that our operating units are positive cash flow generating units and will continue to sustain their operations without any significant liquidity concerns. The performance of these operating units is significantly impacted by the performance of the housing industry, specifically single family housing starts and the repair and remodeling activity. Any unforeseen or unanticipated downturn in the housing industry could have a negative impact on our liquidity position.\nManagement anticipates that our current liquidity position, as well as expected cash flows from our operations should be sufficient to meet ongoing operational cash flow needs, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and other fees payable under other contractual obligations for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $71.4 million, approximately $340.3 million of contractual availability under the ABL Facility and approximately $261.5 million of borrowing base availability.\nIn order to further supplement the Company's operating cash flow, the Company has from time to time opportunistically accessed capital markets based on prevailing economic and financial conditions. Based on market conditions, the Company may elect to pursue additional financing alternatives in the future.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations under financing arrangements and lease commitments, including interest amounts, as of December 31, 2017. Interest on the 6.50% Senior Notes is fixed. Interest on the Term Loan Facility is variable and has been presented at the average rate of approximately 4.8% based on the current LIBOR rate plus 1.0% structure of the instrument with consideration toward anticipated interest rate increases over the applicable term. Interest on the ABL Facility is variable and has been presented at the average rate of approximately 2.6% using the average principal balance during 2017 as a projection for future years' average balances. Actual interest rates for future periods may differ from those presented here.\n\n (1) Long-term debt is shown before discount, and consists of our 6.50% Senior Notes, Term Loan Facility, and ABL Facility. This amount excludes any estimate for excess cash flow payments that may be required under the Term Loan Facility. For more information concerning the long-term debt, see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d above. \n (2) Interest payments for variable interest debt are based on current interest rates. \n (3) Non-cancelable lease commitments represent lease payments for facilities and equipment. \n (4) Purchase obligations are defined as purchase agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including quantity, price and the approximate timing of the transaction. These obligations are related primarily to inventory purchases under two 2018 contracts that were finalized during 2017. \n (5) Other long-term liabilities include pension obligations which are estimated based on our 2017 annual funding requirements. Because we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future tax payments related to uncertain tax positions, certain tax related obligations of approximately $4.5 million, including interest and penalties of approximately $1.9 million, have been excluded from the table above. Additionally, because we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future tax payments related to the Tax Receivable Agreement, certain tax related obligations of approximately $69.5 million, have been excluded from the table above. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nInflation; Seasonality\nOur performance is dependent to a significant extent upon the levels of home repair and remodeling and new home construction spending, all of which are affected by such factors as interest rates, inflation, consumer confidence and unemployment. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the past three fiscal years.\nThe demand for our products is seasonal, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States and Canada where inclement weather conditions during the winter months usually reduces the level of building and remodeling activity in both the home repair and remodeling and the new home construction sectors. Our sales in both segments are usually lower during the first and fourth quarters. Since a portion of our manufacturing overhead and operating expenses are relatively fixed throughout the year, operating income and net earnings tend to be lower in quarters with lower sales levels. In addition, the demand for cash to fund our working capital is greater from late in the fourth quarter through the first quarter.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated

prepared by the management of a leading North American manufacturer of exterior building products, detailing the company's financial condition and operating results. The MD&A covers changes in financial position, liquidity, capital structure, and business developments for the years provided in the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe company operates in two reportable segments: Siding, Fencing, and Stone, and Windows and Doors, with the latter accounting for slightly more sales. The company believes its diverse product portfolio and manufacturing platform gives it a competitive advantage.\n\nSeveral acquisitions have strengthened the company's position in its market segments. The company underwent an IPO in May 2013 and entered into a Merger Agreement in January 2018, which will make them a privately held subsidiary of CD&R, and shares' trading will cease. The company's indebtedness conditions place certain restrictions on asset transfers and dividend payments.\n\nKey financial metrics such as net sales, cost of products sold, and operating earnings are presented, with net sales being affected by shipping charges, and discounts and the cost of products sold including direct material costs among others. The discussion highlights the impact of commodity pricing and weather conditions on operations, and a detailed review of critical accounting policies such as revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, and goodwill impairment.\n\nThe analysis includes a summary of financial performance by segment (Siding, Fencing, and Stone, and Windows and Doors) and addresses concerns such as interest expense, debt agreements, and tax obligations. Additionally, the company's liquidity and capital requirements are discussed, including its approach to managing debt and funding operating capital through cash flow from operations and available credit facilities. \n\nRecent accounting pronouncements and their potential impact on the company's financial statements are also covered in the report."}
