Risk Factors, additional factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those described in the forward-looking statements. Other factors that we have not identified in this report could also have this effect.\nOverview\nWe own and operate crude oil, natural gas and NGL midstream assets and operations. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we are a fully-integrated midstream solution provider that specializes in connecting shale-based energy supplies to key demand markets. We conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Crestwood Midstream, a limited partnership that owns and operates gathering, processing, storage, and transportation assets in the most prolific shale plays across the United States.\nOur Company\nWe provide broad-ranging services to customers across the crude oil, natural gas and NGL sector of the energy value chain. Our midstream infrastructure is geographically located in or near significant supply basins, especially developed and emerging liquids-rich and crude oil shale plays, across the United States. Our operating assets, including those of our joint ventures, primarily include:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>natural gas facilities with approximately 2.9 Bcf/d of gathering capacity, 0.9 Bcf/d of processing capacity, 75.8 Bcf of certificated working storage capacity and 1.6 Bcf/d of firm transportation capacity;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>crude oil facilities with approximately 125,000 Bbls/d of gathering capacity, 1.9 MMBbls of storage capacity, 20,000 Bbls/d of transportation capacity and 180,000 Bbls/d of rail loading capacity;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NGL facilities with approximately 2.5 MMBbls of storage capacity, as well as our portfolio of transportation assets (consisting of truck and rail terminals, truck/trailer units and rail cars) capable of transporting approximately 1.3 MMBbls/d of NGLs; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>produced water gathering facilities with approximately 90,000 Bbls/d of gathering capacity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur financial statements reflect three operating and reporting segments: (i) gathering and processing, which includes our natural gas, crude oil and produced water G&P operations; (ii) storage and transportation, which includes our natural gas and crude oil storage and transportation operations; and (iii) marketing, supply and logistics, which includes our NGL marketing and logistics business, crude oil storage and rail loading facilities and fleet. For a description of the assets included in our operating and reporting segments, see Part I, Item 1. Business.\nGathering and Processing\nOur G&P operations and investments provide gathering, compression, treating, and processing services to producers in multiple unconventional resource plays in North Dakota, West Virginia, Texas, New Mexico, Wyoming and Arkansas, and we have established footprints in core of the core\u201d areas of many of the largest shale plays. We believe that our strategy of focusing on prolific, low-cost shale plays positions us well to (i) generate greater returns in varying commodity price environments, (ii) capture greater upside economics when development activity occurs, and (iii) in general, better manage through commodity price cycles and production changes associated therewith.\nStorage and Transportation\nOur S&T operations and investments consist of our crude oil terminals in the Bakken and Powder River Basin and our natural gas storage and transportation assets in the Northeast and Texas Gulf Coast.\nMarketing, Supply and Logistics\nOur MS&L segment consists of our NGL marketing and logistics operations located in over 30 states, including Florida, Indiana, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. We utilize our trucking and rail fleet, processing and storage facilities, and contracted storage and pipeline capacity on a portfolio basis to provide integrated supply and logistics solutions to producers, refiners and other customers.\nOutlook and Trends\nOur business objective is to create long-term value for our unitholders. We expect to create long-term value by consistently generating stable operating margins and improved cash flows from operations by prudently financing our investments, maximizing throughput on our assets, and effectively controlling our operating and administrative costs. Our business strategy depends, in part, on our ability to provide increased services to our customers at competitive fees, including opportunities to expand our services resulting from expansions, organic growth projects and acquisitions that can be financed appropriately.\nWe have taken a number of strategic steps to better position the Company as a stronger, better capitalized company that can over time accretively grow cash flows and sustainably resume growing our distributions. Those strategic steps included (i) simplifying our corporate structure to eliminate our incentive distribution rights (IDRs) and create better alignment of interests with our unitholders; (ii) divesting assets to reduce approximately $1 billion of long-term debt to ensure long-term balance sheet strength; (iii) realigning our operating structure to significantly reduce operating and administrative expenses; (iv)\nforming strategic joint ventures to enhance our competitive position around certain operating assets; and (v) focusing our growth capital expenditures on our highest return organic projects around our core growth assets in the Bakken Shale, Powder River Basin and Delaware Permian. We will remain focused on efficiently allocating capital expenditures by investing in accretive, organic growth projects, maintaining low-cost operations (through increased operating efficiencies and cost discipline) and maintaining our balance sheet strength through continued financial discipline. We expect to focus on expansion and greenfield opportunities to provide midstream services for crude oil, natural gas, and produced water, including gathering, storage and terminalling, condensate stabilization, truck loading/unloading options and connections to third party pipelines and produced water gathering, disposal and recycling in the Bakken Shale, Powder River Basin and Delaware Permian in the near term, while closely monitoring longer-term expansion opportunities in the northeast Marcellus. As a result, the Company is well positioned to execute its business plan and capitalize on the improving market conditions around many of our core assets.\nWhile market conditions remain challenging around some of our assets, the Company continues to be positioned to generate consistent results in a low commodity price environment without sacrificing revenue upside as market conditions improve. For example, many of our more mature G&P assets are supported by long-term, core acreage dedications in shale plays that are economic to varying degrees based upon natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices, the availability of infrastructure to flow production to market, and the operational and financial condition of our diverse customer base. In addition, a substantial portion of our midstream investments are based on fixed-fee or minimum volume commitment agreements that ensure a minimum level of cash flow regardless of actual commodity prices or volumetric throughput. Over time, we expect cash flows from our more mature, non-core, assets to stabilize and potentially increase with the improving commodity price environment, while the growth from our core assets in the Bakken Shale, Powder River Basin, Delaware Permian and northeast Marcellus drive significant growth to the Company.\nSegment Highlights\nBelow is a discussion of events that highlight our core business and financing activities. Through continued execution of our plan, we have materially improved the strategic and financial position of the Company and expect to capitalize on increasing opportunities in an improving but competitive market environment, which will position us to achieve our chief business objective to create long-term value for our unitholders.\nGathering and Processing\nBakken. In the Bakken, we are expanding and upgrading our Arrow system water handling facilities and increasing natural gas capacity on the system, which should allow for substantial growth in volumetric throughput across all of our crude oil, produced water and natural gas gathering systems. In addition, we are constructing a 120 MMcf/d cryogenic plant that we anticipate will be placed in-service in the third quarter of 2019 to fulfill 100% of the processing requirements for producers on the Arrow system upon expiration of third-party processing contracts in the third quarter 2019. Upon completion of the expansion, we expect to have 150 MMcf/d of gas processing capacity in the Bakken. We believe the expansion of our gas processing capacity on the Arrow system will, among other things, spur greater development activity around the Arrow system, allow us to provide greater flow assurance to our producer customers and reduce flaring of natural gas, and reduce the downstream constraints currently experienced by producers on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.\nPowder River Basin. In the Powder River Basin, our Jackalope joint venture with Williams continues to benefit from increased drilling activity and better than anticipated well results. Jackalope is expanding its gathering system and Bucking Horse processing plant to increase processing capacity to 345 MMcf/d in late 2019/early 2020. The Phase 2 Jackalope expansion also includes gathering, compression and a second processing plant which will add an additional 200 MMcf/d to the Jackalope system.\nDelaware Permian. In the Delaware Permian, we have identified gathering and processing and transportation opportunities in and around our existing assets, including our Crestwood Permian joint venture. Crestwood Permian Basin owns and operates the Nautilus system in SWEPI's operated position in the Delaware Permian. Crestwood Permian Basin provides gathering, dehydration, compression and liquids handling services to SWEPI under a 20-year fixed-fee gathering agreement. SWEPI has dedicated to Crestwood Permian Basin the gathering rights for SWEPI's gas production across a large acreage position in Loving, Reeves, Ward and Culberson Counties, Texas. The Nautilus gathering system will be constructed to ultimately include 194 miles of low pressure gathering lines, 36 miles of high pressure trunklines and centralized compression facilities which are expandable over time as production increases, producing gas gathering capacity of approximately 250 MMcf/d. In addition, the Orla processing plant was further expanded and integrated in July 2018 to connect the Nautilus gas gathering system to the Orla plant.\nMarketing, Supply and Logistics\nIn October 2018, we sold our West Coast facilities to a third party for net proceeds of approximately $70.5 million. The West Coast assets included a gas gathering and processing system, fractionator, butamer and various rail and truck terminal and storage facilities located in California, Nevada, Wyoming and Utah.\nDuring 2017 and 2018, we realigned our Marketing, Supply and Logistics operations, including leadership changes, cost reductions, resizing of our truck and rail fleet, and the implementation of rate and profitability key performance indicators. We believe these changes will result in improved profitability and operating efficiencies for this business in the future.\nRegulatory Matters\nMany aspects of the energy midstream sector, such as crude-by-rail activities and pipeline integrity, have experienced increased regulatory oversight over the past few years. However, under the current Presidential Administration, we anticipate changes in policy that could lessen the degree of regulatory scrutiny we face in the near term.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was passed by the U.S. Congress, which modified several aspects of the U.S. income tax code beginning in 2018. The Tax Act requires that the business interest deduction be limited to the sum of business interest income and 30% of adjusted taxable income. For the purposes of this limitation, adjusted taxable income will be computed without regard to any business interest expense or business interest income, and in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, any deduction allowable for depreciation, amortization, or depletion.\nEffective December 2017, the Tax Act changed several provisions of the federal tax code, including a reduction in the maximum corporate tax rate. On March 15, 2018, the FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes (Revised Policy Statement) stating that it will no longer permit master limited partnerships to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. Also on March 15, 2018, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) proposing rules for implementation of the Revised Policy Statement and the corporate income tax rate reduction with respect to pipeline rates. On July 18, 2018, the FERC issued an order denying requests for rehearing and clarification of its Revised Policy Statement because it is a non-binding policy and parties will have the opportunity to address the policy as applied in future cases. In the rehearing order, the FERC clarified that a pipeline organized as a master limited partnership will not be precluded in a future proceeding from providing support that it is entitled to an income tax allowance and demonstrating that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a double-recovery of investors' income tax costs. Also on July 18, 2018, the FERC issued a Final Rule adopting procedures that are generally the same as proposed in the NOPR with a few clarifications and modifications. With limited exceptions, the Final Rule requires all FERC-regulated natural gas pipelines that have cost-based rates for service to make a one-time Form No. 501-G filing providing certain financial information and to select one of four options: (i) file a limited NGA Section 4 filing reducing its rates only as required related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Revised Policy Statement; (ii) commit to filing a general NGA Section 4 rate case in the near future; (iii) file a statement explaining why an adjustment to rates is not needed; or (iv) take no other action.\nOn March 15, 2018, the FERC also issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) requesting comments about whether, and if so how, the FERC should address changes relating to accumulated deferred income taxes and bonus depreciation. Comments on the NOI were filed by May 21, 2018, and any actions the FERC may take following receipt of these responses to the NOI are unknown at this time, but could impact the rates midstream companies are permitted to charge its customers for transportation services in the future.\nIn addition, the FERC issued a NOI on April 19, 2018 (Certificate Policy Statement NOI), thereby initiating a review of its policies on certification of natural gas pipelines, including an examination of its long-standing Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities, issued in 1999, that is used to determine whether to grant certificates for new pipeline projects. Comments on the Certificate Policy Statement NOI were due on July 25, 2018, and we are unable to predict what, if any, changes may be proposed as a result of the NOI that will affect our natural gas pipeline business or when such proposals, if any, might become effective. We do not expect that any change in this policy would affect us in a materially different manner than any other similarly sized natural gas pipeline company operating in the United States.\nAlthough we do not have any consolidated operations that have FERC-regulated pipelines, two of our equity investments (Stagecoach Gas and Tres Holdings) have FERC-regulated operations. These equity investments receive revenues from contracts that primarily have market-based rates or negotiated rates that are not tied to cost-of-service rates, and we currently do not expect rates subject to negotiated rates or market-based rates to be affected by the Revised Policy Statement, the Final Rule or any final regulations that may result from the NOI. As a result, we currently do not believe that the Revised Policy Statement, the Final Rule or NOI will have a material impact on our results of operations, but we continue to monitor\ndevelopments at the FERC related to these matters to assess whether the final regulations could have an impact on the future results of our equity investments.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting estimates and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that require difficult, complex, or subjective judgment necessary in accounting for inherently uncertain matters and those that could significantly influence our financial results based on changes in those judgments. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ materially from those estimates. We have discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the board of directors of our general partner.\nGoodwill\nOur goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid for a business over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on December 31, and whenever events indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit could be less than its carrying amount. This evaluation requires us to compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired.\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a number of factors, including discount rates, projected cash flows and the potential value we would receive if we sold the reporting unit. We also compare the total fair value of our reporting units to our overall enterprise value, which considers the market value for our common and preferred units. Estimating projected cash flows requires us to make certain assumptions as it relates to the future operating performance of each of our reporting units (which includes assumptions, among others, about estimating future operating margins and related future growth in those margins, contracting efforts and the cost and timing of facility expansions) and assumptions related to our customers, such as their future capital and operating plans and their financial condition. When considering operating performance, various factors are considered such as current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment, among others. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates. If the assumptions embodied in the projections prove inaccurate, we could incur a future impairment charge. In addition, the use of the income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units (see further discussion of the income approach below) could result in a different fair value if we had utilized a market approach, or a combination thereof.\nWe acquired substantially all of our reporting units in 2013, 2012 and 2011, which required us to record the assets, liabilities and goodwill of each of those reporting units at fair value on the date they were acquired. As a result, any level of decrease in the forecasted cash flows of these businesses or increases in the discount rates utilized to value those businesses from their respective acquisition dates would likely result in the fair value of the reporting unit falling below the carrying value of the reporting unit, and could result in an assessment of whether that reporting unit's goodwill is impaired.\nCurrent commodity prices are significantly lower compared to commodity prices during 2014, and that decrease has adversely impacted forecasted cash flows, discount rates and stock/unit prices for most companies in the midstream industry, including us. In light of these circumstances, we evaluated the carrying value of our reporting units and determined it was more likely than not that the goodwill associated with several of our reporting units was impaired and as a result, we recorded goodwill impairments on several of our reporting units during 2017 and 2016.\nOn January 1, 2018, we combined the four reporting units included in our MS&L segment into one NGL Marketing and Logistics reporting unit for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an ongoing basis as shown in the table below. At January 1, 2018, the goodwill for these reporting units was approximately $101.7 million. We combined these reporting units based on a strategic shift in the way in which we manage, operate and report our NGL operations as an integrated platform instead of as four individual stand-alone operations. We attributed approximately $9.0 million of the goodwill associated with our NGL Marketing and Logistics reporting unit to the West Coast facilities during 2018, and this goodwill was written off in conjunction with the sale of the West Coast assets. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 3 for a further discussion of the sale of our West Coast assets. We did not record any other impairments of our goodwill during 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the goodwill impairments of our reporting units during 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Goodwill Impairments during the Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Goodwill Impairments during the Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Goodwill at December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>G&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marcellus\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arrow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&T\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COLT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MS&L\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NGL Marketing and Logisitics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West Coast\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply and Logistics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storage and Terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trucking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have two reporting units with goodwill associated with them at December 31, 2018 (Arrow and NGL Marketing and Logistics). We continue to monitor our remaining goodwill, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining goodwill in the future if we experience a significant sustained decrease in the market value of our common or preferred units or if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our customers on our remaining operations with goodwill, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those businesses. A 5% decrease in the forecasted cash flows or a 1% increase in the discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of our businesses would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment of either of our reporting units.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets consist of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that have been obtained through multiple historical business combinations and property, plant and equipment that has been constructed in recent years. The initial recording of a majority of these long-lived assets was at fair value, which is estimated by management primarily utilizing market-related information and other projections on the performance of the assets acquired. Management reviews this information to determine its reasonableness in comparison to the assumptions utilized in determining the purchase price of the assets in addition to other market-based information that was received through the purchase process and other sources. These projections also include projections on potential and contractual obligations assumed in these acquisitions. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized in determining fair value, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe utilize assumptions related to the useful lives and related salvage value of our property, plant and equipment in order to determine depreciation and amortization expense each period. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized in determining useful lives, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nTo estimate the useful life of our finite lived intangible assets we utilize assumptions of the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows. Generally this requires us to amortize our intangible assets based on the expected future cash flows (to the extent they are readily determinable) or on a straight-line basis (if they are not readily determinable) of the acquired contracts or customer relationships. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized in determining future cash flows, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe continually monitor our business, the business environment and the performance of our operations to determine if an event has occurred that indicates that a long-lived asset may be impaired. If an event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we may be required to utilize cash flow projections to assess our ability to recover the carrying value of our assets based on our long-lived assets' ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. This differs from our evaluation of goodwill, for which we perform an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill utilizing fair value estimates that primarily utilize discounted cash flows in the estimation process (as described above), and accordingly a reporting unit that has experienced a goodwill impairment may not experience a similar impairment of the underlying long-lived assets included in\nthat reporting unit. During 2018, we did not record impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. During 2017 and 2016, we recorded the following impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment:\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2017, we incurred $82.2 million of impairments of our property, plant and equipment and intangible assets related to our MS&L West Coast operations, which resulted from decreasing forecasted cash flows to be generated by those operations. During 2018, we sold our MS&L West Coast operations for net proceeds of approximately $70.5 million, and recorded a $26.9 million of loss on long-lived assets associated with the sale. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 3 for a further discussion of the sale of these assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During 2016, we incurred a $31.4 million impairment of intangible assets related to our MS&L Trucking operations, which resulted from the impact of increased competition on our Trucking business and the loss of several key customer relationships that were acquired in 2013 to which the intangible assets related.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProjected cash flows of our long-lived assets are generally based on current and anticipated future market conditions, which require significant judgment to make projections and assumptions about pricing, demand, competition, operating costs, construction costs, legal and regulatory issues and other factors that may extend many years into the future and are often outside of our control. If those cash flow projections indicate that the long-lived asset's carrying value is not recoverable, we record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. The estimate of fair value considers a number of factors, including the potential value we would receive if we sold the asset, discount rates and projected cash flows. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe continue to monitor our long-lived assets, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining carrying value of these long-lived assets in the future if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our long-lived assets' customers, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those investments.\nEquity Method Investments\nWe evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the equity method investment may be impaired and that impairment is other than temporary. If an event occurs, we evaluate the recoverability of our carrying value based on the fair value of the investment. If an impairment is indicated, we adjust the carrying values of the asset downward, if necessary, to their estimated fair values.\nWe estimate the fair value of our equity method investments based on a number of factors, including discount rates, projected cash flows, enterprise value and the potential value we would receive if we sold the equity method investment. Estimating projected cash flows requires us to make certain assumptions as it relates to the future operating performance of each of our equity method investments (which includes assumptions, among others, about estimating future operating margins and related future growth in those margins, contracting efforts and the cost and timing of facility expansions) and assumptions related to our equity method investments' customers, such as their future capital and operating plans and their financial condition. When considering operating performance, various factors are considered such as current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment, among others. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe continue to monitor our equity method investments, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining carrying value of these investments in the future if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our equity method investments' customers, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those investments.\nOur equity method investments have long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments in their underlying financial statements, and our equity investees apply similar accounting policies and have similar critical accounting estimates in assessing those assets for impairment as we do. During 2016, our PRBIC equity method investment recorded an impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets, and we reflected a $5.8 million reduction of our equity earnings from PRBIC related to our share of that impairment. Our Stagecoach Gas equity method investment has approximately $656.5 million of goodwill in its financial statements, which it assesses for impairment annually on December 31 or whenever events indicate that it is more likely than not that its fair value could be less than its carrying amount. This assessment requires Stagecoach Gas to make certain assumptions about its further operating performance (which includes assumptions, among others, about estimating future operating margins and related future growth in those margins, contracting efforts and the cost and timing of facility expansions, in addition to current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment). A\nsignificant decrease in the assumptions utilized by Stagecoach Gas could result in a significant reduction in our equity earnings from Stagecoach Gas. Our investment in Stagecoach Gas was approximately $830.4 million at December 31, 2018.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership interest to determine if the entity is a variable interest entity (VIE). Our interests in a VIE are referred to as variable interests. Variable interests can be contractual, ownership or other interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the VIE's assets. When we conclude that we hold an interest in a VIE we must determine if we are the entity's primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a VIE.\nWe consolidate any VIE when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary. We must disclose the nature of any interests in a VIE that is not consolidated. Significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a VIE and in evaluating our interest in a VIE. We use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a VIE. We evaluate the entity's need for continuing financial support; the equity holder's lack of a controlling financial interest; and/or if an equity holder's voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns. We evaluate our interests in a VIE to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. We use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the VIE, either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group. We continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests, including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions. As a result of this analysis, we concluded that our investment in Crestwood Permian is a VIE that we are not the primary beneficiary of, and as a result, we account for our investment in Crestwood Permian as an equity method investment.\nOur other equity investments are not considered to be VIEs. However, any future changes in the design or nature of the activities of these entities may require us to reconsider our conclusions associated with these entities. Such reconsideration would require the identification of the variable interests in the entity and a determination of which party is the entity's primary beneficiary. If an equity investment were considered a VIE and we were determined to be the primary beneficiary, the change could cause us to consolidate the entity. The consolidation of an entity that is currently accounted for under the equity method could have a significant impact on our financial statements. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6 for more information on our equity method investments.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nWe evaluate our overall business performance based primarily on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We do not utilize depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in our key measures because we focus our performance management on cash flow generation and our assets have long useful lives.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA - We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely accepted financial indicators of a company's operational performance and its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to our investors because it allows them to use the same performance measure analyzed internally by our management to evaluate the performance of our businesses and investments without regard to the manner in which they are financed or our capital structure. EBITDA is defined as income before income taxes, plus debt-related costs (interest and debt expense, net, and gain (loss) on modification/extinguishment of debt) and depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. Adjusted EBITDA considers the adjusted earnings impact of our unconsolidated affiliates by adjusting our equity earnings or losses from our unconsolidated affiliates to reflect our proportionate share (based on the distribution percentage) of their EBITDA, excluding impairments. Adjusted EBITDA also considers the impact of certain significant items, such as unit-based compensation charges, gains and losses on long-lived assets, impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, third party costs incurred related to potential and completed acquisitions, certain environmental remediation costs, the change in fair value of commodity inventory-related derivative contracts, costs associated with the realignment of our operations (including our Marketing, Supply and Logistics operations and other cost savings initiatives), and other transactions identified in a specific reporting period. The change in fair value of commodity inventory-related derivative contracts is considered in determining Adjusted EBITDA given that the timing of recognizing gains and losses on these derivative contracts differs from the recognition of revenue for the related underlying sale of inventory to which these derivatives relate. Changes in the fair value of other derivative contracts is not considered in determining Adjusted EBITDA given the relatively short-term nature of those derivative contracts. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, as they do not include deductions for items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest and income taxes, which are necessary to maintain our business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations may vary among entities, so our computation may not be comparable to measures used by other companies.\nSee our reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in Results of Operations below.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations (in millions).\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

2016.\nGathering and Processing\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nEBITDA for our gathering and processing segment increased by approximately $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. Our gathering and processing segment's costs of product/services sold decreased by approximately $713.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, while our revenues only decreased by $683.6 million year over year.\nOur gathering and processing segment's revenues and product costs were impacted by the modified retrospective adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, during the year ended December 31, 2018, which decreased its revenues and product costs by approximately $1,015.4 million and $1,026.8 million, respectively. Also impacting our gathering and processing segment's EBITDA during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, were lower revenues and product costs of approximately $30.2 million and $21.8 million, respectively, as a result of the deconsolidation of Crestwood New Mexico Pipeline LLC (Crestwood New Mexico) in 2017.\nThe remaining increase in our gathering and processing segment's revenues and costs of product/services sold of approximately $362.0 million and $334.8 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, was primarily\ndriven by our Arrow operations. Natural gas volumes and water volumes gathered by our Arrow system increased by 40% and 30%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. These favorable variances were driven by increased producer activity and expanded capacity on our Arrow system. In addition, the Bear Den processing plant was placed into service in late 2017, which increased natural gas volumes gathered and processed by the Arrow system. Arrow also experienced higher average prices on its agreements under which it purchases and sells crude oil as a result of the increase in crude oil prices in 2018 compared to 2017.\nOur gathering and processing segment's operations and maintenance expenses increased by approximately $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the increase in volumes related to our Arrow operations described above.\nOur gathering and processing segment's EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes a loss on long-lived assets of approximately $3.0 million, primarily related to the retirement and/or disposal of certain of our Arrow and Granite Wash gathering and processing assets.\nOur gathering and processing segment's EBITDA was favorably impacted by a net increase in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates of approximately $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. Equity earnings from our Jackalope equity investment increased by approximately $7.6 million primarily due to a 73% and 57% increase in its gathering and processing volumes during 2018 compared to 2017 resulting from increased producer activity on its system. Our equity earnings from our Crestwood Permian equity investment decreased by approximately $4.0 million during 2018 compared to 2017. Pursuant to the Crestwood Permian limited liability company agreement, we were allocated 100% of the equity earnings from Crestwood New Mexico through June 30, 2018. Subsequent to June 30, 2018, our equity earnings from Crestwood New Mexico were allocated based on our ownership percentage in Crestwood Permian, which is currently 50%.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nEBITDA for CEQP's gathering and processing segment increased by approximately $35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our gathering and processing segment's revenues increased by approximately $595.3 million compared to 2016, partially offset by an increase in costs of product/services sold of approximately $563.8 million during 2017 compared to 2016.\nThe increases in revenues and costs during the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily driven by our Arrow operations, which experienced a $611.0 million increase in revenues and a $578.5 million increase in costs of product/services compared to 2016. The increase in Arrow's revenues and costs was primarily driven by higher average prices on Arrow's agreements under which it purchases and sells crude oil. In addition, crude, gas and water volumes gathered by our Arrow system increased by 30%, 10% and 27%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, due to the connection of 97 wells on our Arrow system during 2017 compared to 48 wells during 2016.\nPartially offsetting the increase in our gathering and processing segment's revenues and costs from our Arrow operations during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, were lower revenues and costs of approximately $16.4 million and $10.6 million, respectively, from our Permian operations as a result of the deconsolidation of Crestwood New Mexico in June 2017. For a further discussion of this transaction, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6.\nOur gathering and processing segment's operations and maintenance expenses decreased by approximately $8.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, due to continued cost-reduction efforts undertaken in our operations and the deconsolidation of Crestwood New Mexico.\nOur gathering and processing segment's EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a loss on long-lived assets of approximately $14.4 million, primarily related to the retirement and/or disposition of certain of our Marcellus and Arrow gathering and processing assets.\nThe comparability of our G&P segment's EBITDA was impacted by an $8.6 million impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to our Marcellus operations. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies\u201d above and Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nOur gathering and processing segment's EBITDA was also impacted by a decrease in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates of approximately $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by a $10.3 million decrease in equity earnings from Jackalope resulting from a reduction in its revenues as a result of the restructuring of its contracts with Chesapeake effective January 1, 2017. Jackalope and Chesapeake replaced the cost-of-\nservice based contract with a fixed-fee gathering and processing contract that includes minimum revenue guarantees for a five to seven year period. Partially offsetting the decrease in equity earnings from Jackalope was an increase in equity earnings from our Crestwood Permian equity investment of approximately $8.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared 2016, primarily due to the contribution of Crestwood New Mexico to Crestwood Permian in June 2017, and the Nautilus system coming online in June 2017.\nStorage and Transportation\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nEBITDA for our storage and transportation segment increased by approximately $43.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The comparability of our storage and transportation segment's EBITDA year over year was impacted by a $57 million loss on contingent consideration recorded during 2017 related to our Stagecoach Gas joint venture as further described below.\nDuring 2017 and early 2018, several of COLT's firm rail loading agreements expired that provided COLT with take-or-pay revenues at rates that were higher than spot market rates. As a result, COLT's revenues decreased by approximately $16.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 despite its rail loading volumes increasing by 28% year-over-year. The increase in volumes was due to higher demand for rail loading services resulting from higher Bakken crude oil production and higher basis differentials between Bakken and the U.S. western and eastern markets.\nOur storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was also impacted by a net increase in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. Earnings from our Stagecoach Gas equity investment increased by approximately $4.0 million during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to our share of Stagecoach Gas' equity earnings increasing from 35% to 40% effective July 1, 2018. Effective July 1, 2019, our equity earnings from Stagecoach Gas will be allocated based on our ownership percentage, which is currently 50%. Partially offsetting this increase were lower equity earnings from our Tres Holdings equity investment of approximately $2.2 million due to higher repair and maintenance costs at the joint venture.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nEBITDA for CEQP's storage and transportation segment decreased by approximately $65.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our storage and transportation segment's revenues were lower due to a reduction in revenues of approximately $51.1 million from our COLT Hub operations compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in our rail throughput revenues from the expiration of two rail loading contracts in late 2016, a 58% decrease in rail loading volumes and lower margins resulting from higher average crude oil prices in the Bakken compared to other basins, which has decreased the demand and rates for our rail loading services in 2017 compared to 2016. Also impacting our storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was $44.9 million of goodwill impairments recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to our COLT Hub operations. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies\u201d above and Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nThe comparability of our storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was also impacted by a $57 million loss on contingent consideration recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to our Stagecoach Gas joint venture. Pursuant to the Stagecoach Gas limited liability company agreement, we may be required to make payments of up to $57 million to CEGP after December 31, 2020 if certain criteria are not met by Stagecoach Gas by December 31, 2020, including achieving certain performance targets on growth capital projects. These growth capital projects depend on the construction of other third-party expansion projects, and during 2017, those third-party projects experienced regulatory and other delays that caused Stagecoach Gas to delay its growth capital projects. Although Stagecoach Gas anticipates that these growth capital projects will be constructed in the future, it does not expect that these projects will produce meaningful operating results prior to December 31, 2020.\nOur storage and transportation segment's results was impacted by a $32.4 million loss recognized on the deconsolidation of our Northeast storage and transportation assets as a result of the contribution of these assets to the Stagecoach Gas joint venture in June 2016. The deconsolidation of the Northeast storage and transportation assets resulted in lower revenues and costs of product/services sold of approximately $74.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6 for a further discussion of the deconsolidation of our NE S&T assets.\nWe experienced lower operations and maintenance expenses of approximately $17.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily as a result of the deconsolidation of the Northeast storage and transportation assets. In addition, in June 2016, the Matagorda County court issued a final judgment related to Tres Palacios' 2012 and 2013 property tax years which resulted in CEQP recording additional net property taxes (including interest and penalties) of approximately $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was impacted by an increase in earnings from our unconsolidated affiliates. As discussed above, in June 2016, we deconsolidated our Northeast storage and transportation assets as a result of the Stagecoach Gas transaction and began accounting for our 50% equity interest in Stagecoach Gas under the equity method of accounting. We recognized equity earnings from Stagecoach Gas of approximately $25.3 million and $15.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Earnings from our Tres Holdings equity investment increased by approximately $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to property tax accruals recorded by Tres Holdings during 2016.\nMarketing, Supply and Logistics\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nEBITDA for our marketing, supply and logistics segment increased by approximately $76.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The comparability of our marketing, supply and logistics segment's results was impacted by the sale of certain of our assets during 2018 and 2017 and approximately $121.0 million of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairments recorded during 2017, all of which are further described below.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $26.9 million loss on long-lived assets related to the sale of our West Coast facilities in October 2018, which also resulted in lower revenues and costs of product/services sold of approximately $81.4 million and $71.4 million in 2018 compared to 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $33.6 million gain related to the sale of US Salt, which also resulted in lower revenues and costs of product/services sold of approximately $59.8 million and $34.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017.\nEBITDA for our marketing, supply and logistics segment (excluding the impacts from the sale of our West Coast and US Salt assets described above) was also impacted by an increase in its revenues and costs of product/services sold of approximately $614.3 million and $574.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017.\nOur crude and natural gas marketing operations experienced an increase in its revenues and product costs of approximately $564.5 million and $557.6 million. These increases were driven by higher crude marketing volumes due to increased marketing activity surrounding our crude-related operations.\nThe remaining $32.6 million increase in our revenues (net of costs of product/services sold) during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 was driven by our NGL marketing and logistics operations. Included in our costs of product/services sold was a gain of $29.6 million and a loss of $31.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Of the $29.6 million gain in 2018, approximately $18.3 million related to the change in fair value of commodity inventory-related derivative contracts that had not yet settled in cash at December 31, 2018. The remaining increase in our revenues and costs of product/services sold of our NGL marketing and logistics operations was primarily the result of our ability to capture more marketing opportunities to purchase and sell NGLs given the unusually cold weather during 2018. In addition, we experienced increased demand for trucking, rail, storage and terminal services as a result of an expanded US NGL supply base and market dislocations caused by increased NGL supplies from various high growth regions and regional pipeline outages.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our marketing, supply and logistics segment's operations and maintenance expenses decreased by approximately $12.6 million compared to 2017, primarily due to the sale of our West Coast and US Salt assets described above, in addition to efforts to realign certain of its operations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nEBITDA for our marketing, supply and logistics segment increased by approximately $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The comparability of our marketing, supply and logistics segment's results was significantly impacted by goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairments of $121.0 million recorded during 2017 and goodwill and intangible asset impairments of $140.5 million recorded during 2016. For a further\ndiscussion of our impairments recorded during 2017 and 2016, see Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies\u201d above and Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nOur supply and logistics operations experienced an increase in revenues and costs of product/services sold of $465.0 million and $457.9 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. During 2016, we experienced unseasonably warm weather which resulted in lower demand for NGLs compared to increased demand experienced during 2017. The costs of product/services sold increase includes a loss of $31.2 million and $7.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to our commodity-based derivative contracts. These changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts resulted from higher average NGL prices during 2017 compared to 2016, which resulted in an increase in our liabilities from price risk management activities associated with contracts that provide fixed prices on future sales of our NGL inventory.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, our storage and terminals operations (including our West Coast operations) experienced a $173.6 million and $174.4 million increase in revenues and costs of product/services sold, respectively, compared to 2016. These increases were primarily driven by increases in NGL prices during the year ended December 31, 2017. Although our net operating results were relatively consistent during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, we experienced NGL market headwinds in the Northeast during 2017, with NGL exports and other market dynamics causing price differentials to narrow between purchasing NGLs in the summer (which are then stored in our NGL facilities) and selling NGLs in the winter. These dynamics also caused the rates that we are able to charge for storing NGLs in our facilities to decline from their historical levels. Also during 2017, our West Coast customers also experienced headwinds, with both producers and refineries located in the Western U.S. experiencing regulatory challenges and an inflow of NGLs from the Eastern U.S. This caused demand for the gathering, processing and logistics services from our West Coast operations to remain relatively flat in 2017 compared to 2016. Considering the fact that the net operating results of our storage and terminals operations (including West Coast) have been relatively consistent over the past several years, we do not anticipate that these operations will grow as fast or to the degree that we expected when we merged with Inergy, LP in 2013 given current market dynamics, which we believe will continue for the foreseeable future.\nRevenues and costs of product/services sold from our crude and natural gas marketing operations increased by approximately $261.9 million and $260.5 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. These increases were primarily driven by higher crude marketing volumes due to increased marketing activity surrounding our Bakken crude-related operations resulting from higher Bakken crude oil production and higher basis differentials between Bakken and the U.S. western and eastern markets.\nOur NGL and crude trucking operations continued to experience lower operating results in 2017 compared to 2016, with a $12.4 million and $5.7 million decrease in revenues and costs of product/services sold during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. This decrease was primarily a result of the realignment of our trucking operations in 2017 to reduce the size of our trucking fleet in response to the continued decline in demand for trucking services due to the continued lower commodity price environment.\nOur marketing, supply and logistic segment's operations and maintenance expenses increased by approximately $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. In 2016, we received a $3.1 million property tax refund related to our West Coast operations.\nIn December 2017, we sold 100% of our equity interests in US Salt to an affiliate of Kissner Group Holdings LP for net proceeds of approximately $223.6 million, and we recognized a gain of approximately $33.6 million from the sale. For a further discussion of this sale, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 3.\nOther EBITDA Results\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our general and administrative costs decreased compared to 2017, while we experienced an increase in these costs during 2017 compared to 2016. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred approximately $1.3 million and $2.2 million of transactional and other general and administrative costs related primarily to the realignment initiatives we undertook related to realigning our Marketing, Supply and Logistics operations. In addition, our unit-based compensation charges increased by $3.0 million from 2017 to 2018 and by $6.3 million from 2016 to 2017 due to higher average awards outstanding under our long-term incentive plans.\nItems not affecting EBITDA include the following:\nDepreciation, Amortization and Accretion Expense. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our depreciation, amortization and accretion expense decreased compared to 2017 and 2016, primarily due to the sale of our West Coast assets and US Salt operations during 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the deconsolidation of our Crestwood New Mexico operations in 2017.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, interest and debt expense, net was relatively flat compared to 2017, while we experienced a decrease of approximately $25.7 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The net decrease was primarily due to repayments of amounts previously outstanding under Crestwood Midstream's senior notes in 2017 and late 2016 .\nThe following table provides a summary of our interest and debt expense, net (in millions).\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes\n</td> <td>72.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other debt-related costs\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross interest and debt expense\n</td> <td>104.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: capitalized interest\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and debt expense, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGain (Loss) on Modification/Extinguishment of Debt. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a loss on modification of debt of approximately $0.9 million in conjunction with amending and restating Crestwood Midstream's senior secured revolving credit facility. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $37.7 million in conjunction with the tender of the principal amounts previously outstanding under Crestwood Midstream's senior notes due in 2020 and 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $10.0 million in conjunction with the early tender of a portion of the principal amounts previously outstanding under Crestwood Midstream's senior notes due in 2020 and 2022.\nLiquidity and Sources of Capital\nCrestwood Equity is a holding company that derives all of its operating cash flow from its operating subsidiaries. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated by operating activities from our subsidiaries, distributions from our joint ventures, borrowings under the CMLP credit facility, and sales of equity and debt securities. Our equity investments use cash from their respective operations to fund their operating activities, maintenance and growth capital expenditures, and service their outstanding indebtedness. We believe our liquidity sources and operating cash flows are sufficient to address our future operating, debt service and capital requirements.\nWe make cash quarterly distributions to our common unitholders within approximately 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter in an aggregate amount equal to our available cash for such quarter. We also pay cash quarterly distributions of approximately $15 million to our preferred unitholders. We believe our operating cash flows will well exceed cash distributions to our partners and our preferred unitholders at current levels, and as a result, we will have substantial operating cash flows as a source of liquidity for our growth capital expenditures.\nIn October 2018, Crestwood Midstream entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Second Amended Credit Agreement). The Second Amended Credit Agreement provides for a five-year $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in October 2023 and is available to fund acquisitions, working capital and internal growth projects and for general partnership purposes. Interest rates under the Second Amended Credit Agreement were reduced by 0.25%, and the debt covenants under the Second Amended Credit Agreement are materially consistent with those under the previous credit facility. For a further discussion of the Second Amended Credit Agreement, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 9. As of December 31, 2018, we had $524.0 million of available capacity under the credit facility considering the most restrictive debt covenants in the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants applicable to the credit facility and our senior notes. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 9 for a more detailed description of the credit facility and senior notes.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a summary of Crestwood Equity's cash flows by category (in millions):\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>255.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>346.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>(241.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>867.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(294.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,212.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur operating cash flows decreased by $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. We experienced higher revenues and costs primarily from our gathering and processing segment's Arrow operations of $362.0 million and $334.8 million, respectively, and higher revenues (net of costs of product/services sold) from our marketing, supply and logistics segment's NGL marketing and logistics operations of approximately $32.6 million . Offsetting these higher revenues and costs was a $16.3 million decrease in operating revenues from our COLT Hub operations and a net cash outflow from working capital requirements of approximately $47.2 million. For a further discussion of our segments' results, see Results of Operations above.\nOur operating cash flows decreased approximately $90.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $125.6 million decrease in our storage and transportation segment's revenues primarily resulting from the deconsolidation of our Northeast storage and transportation assets and a reduction in rail throughput revenues from our COLT operations. This was partially offset by a $1,488.5 million increase in revenues from our gathering and processing and marketing, supply and logistics operations discussed above, offset by a $1,449.6 million increase in costs of product/services sold primarily related to these segments' operations.\nInvesting Activities\nCapital Expenditures. The energy midstream business is capital intensive, requiring significant investments for the acquisition or development of new facilities. We categorize our capital expenditures as either:\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>growth capital expenditures, which are made to construct additional assets, expand and upgrade existing systems, or acquire additional assets; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintenance capital expenditures, which are made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets, extend their useful lives or comply with regulatory requirements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2019, we anticipate growth capital expenditures of approximately $275 million to $325 million, which includes contributions to our equity investments related to their capital projects. In addition, we expect to spend between approximately $20 million to $25 million on maintenance capital expenditures and approximately $25 million to $30 million on capital expenditures that are directly reimbursable by our customers. We anticipate that our growth and reimbursable capital expenditures in 2019 will increase the services we can provide to our customers and the operating efficiencies of our systems. We expect to finance our capital expenditures with a combination of cash generated by our operating subsidiaries, distributions received from our equity investments and borrowings under our credit facility.\nWe have identified additional growth capital project opportunities for each of our reporting segments. Additional commitments or expenditures will be made at our discretion, and any discontinuation of the construction of these projects will likely result in less future cash flows and earnings.

These forward-looking statements include:\n \u2022 statements that are not historical in nature, including, but not limited to: (i) our belief that anticipated cash from operations, cash distributions from entities that we control, and borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for the foreseeable future; (ii) our belief that we do not have material potential liability in connection with legal proceedings that would have a significant financial impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows; and (iii) our belief that our assets will continue to benefit from the development of unconventional shale plays as significant supply basins; and \n \u2022 statements preceded by, followed by or that contain forward-looking terminology including the words believe,\u201d expect,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d intend\u201d or the negation thereof, or similar expressions. \nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements due to, among others, the following factors:\n \u2022 our ability to successfully implement our business plan for our assets and operations; \n \u2022 governmental legislation and regulations; \n \u2022 industry factors that influence the supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs; \n \u2022 industry factors that influence the demand for services in the markets (particularly unconventional shale plays) in which we provide services; \n \u2022 weather conditions; \n \u2022 the availability of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, and the price of those commodities, to consumers relative to the price of alternative and competing fuels; \n \u2022 economic conditions; \n \u2022 costs or difficulties related to the integration of acquisitions and success of our joint ventures' operations; \n \u2022 environmental claims; \n \u2022 operating hazards and other risks incidental to the provision of midstream services, including gathering, compressing, treating, processing, fractionating, transporting and storing energy products (i.e., crude oil, NGLs and natural gas) and related products (i.e., produced water); \n \u2022 interest rates; \n \u2022 the price and availability of debt and equity financing, including our ability to raise capital through alternatives like joint ventures; and \n \u2022 the ability to sell or monetize assets, to reduce indebtedness, to repurchase our equity securities, to make strategic investments, or for other general partnership purposes. \nWe have described under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, additional factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those described in the forward-looking statements. Other factors that we have not identified in this report could also have this effect.\nOverview\nWe own and operate crude oil, natural gas and NGL midstream assets and operations. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we are a fully-integrated midstream solution provider that specializes in connecting shale-based energy supplies to key demand markets. We conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Crestwood Midstream, a limited partnership that owns and operates gathering, processing, storage, and transportation assets in the most prolific shale plays across the United States.\nOur Company\nWe provide broad-ranging services to customers across the crude oil, natural gas and NGL sector of the energy value chain. Our midstream infrastructure is geographically located in or near significant supply basins, especially developed and emerging liquids-rich and crude oil shale plays, across the United States. Our operating assets, including those of our joint ventures, primarily include:\n \u2022 natural gas facilities with approximately 2.9 Bcf/d of gathering capacity, 0.9 Bcf/d of processing capacity, 75.8 Bcf of certificated working storage capacity and 1.6 Bcf/d of firm transportation capacity; \n \u2022 crude oil facilities with approximately 125,000 Bbls/d of gathering capacity, 1.9 MMBbls of storage capacity, 20,000 Bbls/d of transportation capacity and 180,000 Bbls/d of rail loading capacity; \n \u2022 NGL facilities with approximately 2.5 MMBbls of storage capacity, as well as our portfolio of transportation assets (consisting of truck and rail terminals, truck/trailer units and rail cars) capable of transporting approximately 1.3 MMBbls/d of NGLs; and \n \u2022 produced water gathering facilities with approximately 90,000 Bbls/d of gathering capacity. \nOur financial statements reflect three operating and reporting segments: (i) gathering and processing, which includes our natural gas, crude oil and produced water G&P operations; (ii) storage and transportation, which includes our natural gas and crude oil storage and transportation operations; and (iii) marketing, supply and logistics, which includes our NGL marketing and logistics business, crude oil storage and rail loading facilities and fleet. For a description of the assets included in our operating and reporting segments, see Part I, Item 1. Business.\nGathering and Processing\nOur G&P operations and investments provide gathering, compression, treating, and processing services to producers in multiple unconventional resource plays in North Dakota, West Virginia, Texas, New Mexico, Wyoming and Arkansas, and we have established footprints in core of the core\u201d areas of many of the largest shale plays. We believe that our strategy of focusing on prolific, low-cost shale plays positions us well to (i) generate greater returns in varying commodity price environments, (ii) capture greater upside economics when development activity occurs, and (iii) in general, better manage through commodity price cycles and production changes associated therewith.\nStorage and Transportation\nOur S&T operations and investments consist of our crude oil terminals in the Bakken and Powder River Basin and our natural gas storage and transportation assets in the Northeast and Texas Gulf Coast.\nMarketing, Supply and Logistics\nOur MS&L segment consists of our NGL marketing and logistics operations located in over 30 states, including Florida, Indiana, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. We utilize our trucking and rail fleet, processing and storage facilities, and contracted storage and pipeline capacity on a portfolio basis to provide integrated supply and logistics solutions to producers, refiners and other customers.\nOutlook and Trends\nOur business objective is to create long-term value for our unitholders. We expect to create long-term value by consistently generating stable operating margins and improved cash flows from operations by prudently financing our investments, maximizing throughput on our assets, and effectively controlling our operating and administrative costs. Our business strategy depends, in part, on our ability to provide increased services to our customers at competitive fees, including opportunities to expand our services resulting from expansions, organic growth projects and acquisitions that can be financed appropriately.\nWe have taken a number of strategic steps to better position the Company as a stronger, better capitalized company that can over time accretively grow cash flows and sustainably resume growing our distributions. Those strategic steps included (i) simplifying our corporate structure to eliminate our incentive distribution rights (IDRs) and create better alignment of interests with our unitholders; (ii) divesting assets to reduce approximately $1 billion of long-term debt to ensure long-term balance sheet strength; (iii) realigning our operating structure to significantly reduce operating and administrative expenses; (iv)\nforming strategic joint ventures to enhance our competitive position around certain operating assets; and (v) focusing our growth capital expenditures on our highest return organic projects around our core growth assets in the Bakken Shale, Powder River Basin and Delaware Permian. We will remain focused on efficiently allocating capital expenditures by investing in accretive, organic growth projects, maintaining low-cost operations (through increased operating efficiencies and cost discipline) and maintaining our balance sheet strength through continued financial discipline. We expect to focus on expansion and greenfield opportunities to provide midstream services for crude oil, natural gas, and produced water, including gathering, storage and terminalling, condensate stabilization, truck loading/unloading options and connections to third party pipelines and produced water gathering, disposal and recycling in the Bakken Shale, Powder River Basin and Delaware Permian in the near term, while closely monitoring longer-term expansion opportunities in the northeast Marcellus. As a result, the Company is well positioned to execute its business plan and capitalize on the improving market conditions around many of our core assets.\nWhile market conditions remain challenging around some of our assets, the Company continues to be positioned to generate consistent results in a low commodity price environment without sacrificing revenue upside as market conditions improve. For example, many of our more mature G&P assets are supported by long-term, core acreage dedications in shale plays that are economic to varying degrees based upon natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices, the availability of infrastructure to flow production to market, and the operational and financial condition of our diverse customer base. In addition, a substantial portion of our midstream investments are based on fixed-fee or minimum volume commitment agreements that ensure a minimum level of cash flow regardless of actual commodity prices or volumetric throughput. Over time, we expect cash flows from our more mature, non-core, assets to stabilize and potentially increase with the improving commodity price environment, while the growth from our core assets in the Bakken Shale, Powder River Basin, Delaware Permian and northeast Marcellus drive significant growth to the Company.\nSegment Highlights\nBelow is a discussion of events that highlight our core business and financing activities. Through continued execution of our plan, we have materially improved the strategic and financial position of the Company and expect to capitalize on increasing opportunities in an improving but competitive market environment, which will position us to achieve our chief business objective to create long-term value for our unitholders.\nGathering and Processing\nBakken. In the Bakken, we are expanding and upgrading our Arrow system water handling facilities and increasing natural gas capacity on the system, which should allow for substantial growth in volumetric throughput across all of our crude oil, produced water and natural gas gathering systems. In addition, we are constructing a 120 MMcf/d cryogenic plant that we anticipate will be placed in-service in the third quarter of 2019 to fulfill 100% of the processing requirements for producers on the Arrow system upon expiration of third-party processing contracts in the third quarter 2019. Upon completion of the expansion, we expect to have 150 MMcf/d of gas processing capacity in the Bakken. We believe the expansion of our gas processing capacity on the Arrow system will, among other things, spur greater development activity around the Arrow system, allow us to provide greater flow assurance to our producer customers and reduce flaring of natural gas, and reduce the downstream constraints currently experienced by producers on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.\nPowder River Basin. In the Powder River Basin, our Jackalope joint venture with Williams continues to benefit from increased drilling activity and better than anticipated well results. Jackalope is expanding its gathering system and Bucking Horse processing plant to increase processing capacity to 345 MMcf/d in late 2019/early 2020. The Phase 2 Jackalope expansion also includes gathering, compression and a second processing plant which will add an additional 200 MMcf/d to the Jackalope system.\nDelaware Permian. In the Delaware Permian, we have identified gathering and processing and transportation opportunities in and around our existing assets, including our Crestwood Permian joint venture. Crestwood Permian Basin owns and operates the Nautilus system in SWEPI's operated position in the Delaware Permian. Crestwood Permian Basin provides gathering, dehydration, compression and liquids handling services to SWEPI under a 20-year fixed-fee gathering agreement. SWEPI has dedicated to Crestwood Permian Basin the gathering rights for SWEPI's gas production across a large acreage position in Loving, Reeves, Ward and Culberson Counties, Texas. The Nautilus gathering system will be constructed to ultimately include 194 miles of low pressure gathering lines, 36 miles of high pressure trunklines and centralized compression facilities which are expandable over time as production increases, producing gas gathering capacity of approximately 250 MMcf/d. In addition, the Orla processing plant was further expanded and integrated in July 2018 to connect the Nautilus gas gathering system to the Orla plant.\nMarketing, Supply and Logistics\nIn October 2018, we sold our West Coast facilities to a third party for net proceeds of approximately $70.5 million. The West Coast assets included a gas gathering and processing system, fractionator, butamer and various rail and truck terminal and storage facilities located in California, Nevada, Wyoming and Utah.\nDuring 2017 and 2018, we realigned our Marketing, Supply and Logistics operations, including leadership changes, cost reductions, resizing of our truck and rail fleet, and the implementation of rate and profitability key performance indicators. We believe these changes will result in improved profitability and operating efficiencies for this business in the future.\nRegulatory Matters\nMany aspects of the energy midstream sector, such as crude-by-rail activities and pipeline integrity, have experienced increased regulatory oversight over the past few years. However, under the current Presidential Administration, we anticipate changes in policy that could lessen the degree of regulatory scrutiny we face in the near term.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was passed by the U.S. Congress, which modified several aspects of the U.S. income tax code beginning in 2018. The Tax Act requires that the business interest deduction be limited to the sum of business interest income and 30% of adjusted taxable income. For the purposes of this limitation, adjusted taxable income will be computed without regard to any business interest expense or business interest income, and in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, any deduction allowable for depreciation, amortization, or depletion.\nEffective December 2017, the Tax Act changed several provisions of the federal tax code, including a reduction in the maximum corporate tax rate. On March 15, 2018, the FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes (Revised Policy Statement) stating that it will no longer permit master limited partnerships to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. Also on March 15, 2018, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) proposing rules for implementation of the Revised Policy Statement and the corporate income tax rate reduction with respect to pipeline rates. On July 18, 2018, the FERC issued an order denying requests for rehearing and clarification of its Revised Policy Statement because it is a non-binding policy and parties will have the opportunity to address the policy as applied in future cases. In the rehearing order, the FERC clarified that a pipeline organized as a master limited partnership will not be precluded in a future proceeding from providing support that it is entitled to an income tax allowance and demonstrating that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a double-recovery of investors' income tax costs. Also on July 18, 2018, the FERC issued a Final Rule adopting procedures that are generally the same as proposed in the NOPR with a few clarifications and modifications. With limited exceptions, the Final Rule requires all FERC-regulated natural gas pipelines that have cost-based rates for service to make a one-time Form No. 501-G filing providing certain financial information and to select one of four options: (i) file a limited NGA Section 4 filing reducing its rates only as required related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Revised Policy Statement; (ii) commit to filing a general NGA Section 4 rate case in the near future; (iii) file a statement explaining why an adjustment to rates is not needed; or (iv) take no other action.\nOn March 15, 2018, the FERC also issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) requesting comments about whether, and if so how, the FERC should address changes relating to accumulated deferred income taxes and bonus depreciation. Comments on the NOI were filed by May 21, 2018, and any actions the FERC may take following receipt of these responses to the NOI are unknown at this time, but could impact the rates midstream companies are permitted to charge its customers for transportation services in the future.\nIn addition, the FERC issued a NOI on April 19, 2018 (Certificate Policy Statement NOI), thereby initiating a review of its policies on certification of natural gas pipelines, including an examination of its long-standing Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities, issued in 1999, that is used to determine whether to grant certificates for new pipeline projects. Comments on the Certificate Policy Statement NOI were due on July 25, 2018, and we are unable to predict what, if any, changes may be proposed as a result of the NOI that will affect our natural gas pipeline business or when such proposals, if any, might become effective. We do not expect that any change in this policy would affect us in a materially different manner than any other similarly sized natural gas pipeline company operating in the United States.\nAlthough we do not have any consolidated operations that have FERC-regulated pipelines, two of our equity investments (Stagecoach Gas and Tres Holdings) have FERC-regulated operations. These equity investments receive revenues from contracts that primarily have market-based rates or negotiated rates that are not tied to cost-of-service rates, and we currently do not expect rates subject to negotiated rates or market-based rates to be affected by the Revised Policy Statement, the Final Rule or any final regulations that may result from the NOI. As a result, we currently do not believe that the Revised Policy Statement, the Final Rule or NOI will have a material impact on our results of operations, but we continue to monitor\ndevelopments at the FERC related to these matters to assess whether the final regulations could have an impact on the future results of our equity investments.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting estimates and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that require difficult, complex, or subjective judgment necessary in accounting for inherently uncertain matters and those that could significantly influence our financial results based on changes in those judgments. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ materially from those estimates. We have discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the board of directors of our general partner.\nGoodwill\nOur goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid for a business over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on December 31, and whenever events indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit could be less than its carrying amount. This evaluation requires us to compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired.\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a number of factors, including discount rates, projected cash flows and the potential value we would receive if we sold the reporting unit. We also compare the total fair value of our reporting units to our overall enterprise value, which considers the market value for our common and preferred units. Estimating projected cash flows requires us to make certain assumptions as it relates to the future operating performance of each of our reporting units (which includes assumptions, among others, about estimating future operating margins and related future growth in those margins, contracting efforts and the cost and timing of facility expansions) and assumptions related to our customers, such as their future capital and operating plans and their financial condition. When considering operating performance, various factors are considered such as current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment, among others. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates. If the assumptions embodied in the projections prove inaccurate, we could incur a future impairment charge. In addition, the use of the income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units (see further discussion of the income approach below) could result in a different fair value if we had utilized a market approach, or a combination thereof.\nWe acquired substantially all of our reporting units in 2013, 2012 and 2011, which required us to record the assets, liabilities and goodwill of each of those reporting units at fair value on the date they were acquired. As a result, any level of decrease in the forecasted cash flows of these businesses or increases in the discount rates utilized to value those businesses from their respective acquisition dates would likely result in the fair value of the reporting unit falling below the carrying value of the reporting unit, and could result in an assessment of whether that reporting unit's goodwill is impaired.\nCurrent commodity prices are significantly lower compared to commodity prices during 2014, and that decrease has adversely impacted forecasted cash flows, discount rates and stock/unit prices for most companies in the midstream industry, including us. In light of these circumstances, we evaluated the carrying value of our reporting units and determined it was more likely than not that the goodwill associated with several of our reporting units was impaired and as a result, we recorded goodwill impairments on several of our reporting units during 2017 and 2016.\nOn January 1, 2018, we combined the four reporting units included in our MS&L segment into one NGL Marketing and Logistics reporting unit for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an ongoing basis as shown in the table below. At January 1, 2018, the goodwill for these reporting units was approximately $101.7 million. We combined these reporting units based on a strategic shift in the way in which we manage, operate and report our NGL operations as an integrated platform instead of as four individual stand-alone operations. We attributed approximately $9.0 million of the goodwill associated with our NGL Marketing and Logistics reporting unit to the West Coast facilities during 2018, and this goodwill was written off in conjunction with the sale of the West Coast assets. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 3 for a further discussion of the sale of our West Coast assets. We did not record any other impairments of our goodwill during 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the goodwill impairments of our reporting units during 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Goodwill Impairments during the Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Goodwill Impairments during the Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Goodwill at December 31, 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>G&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marcellus\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arrow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&T\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COLT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MS&L\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NGL Marketing and Logisitics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West Coast\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply and Logistics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Storage and Terminals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trucking\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have two reporting units with goodwill associated with them at December 31, 2018 (Arrow and NGL Marketing and Logistics). We continue to monitor our remaining goodwill, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining goodwill in the future if we experience a significant sustained decrease in the market value of our common or preferred units or if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our customers on our remaining operations with goodwill, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those businesses. A 5% decrease in the forecasted cash flows or a 1% increase in the discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of our businesses would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment of either of our reporting units.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets consist of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that have been obtained through multiple historical business combinations and property, plant and equipment that has been constructed in recent years. The initial recording of a majority of these long-lived assets was at fair value, which is estimated by management primarily utilizing market-related information and other projections on the performance of the assets acquired. Management reviews this information to determine its reasonableness in comparison to the assumptions utilized in determining the purchase price of the assets in addition to other market-based information that was received through the purchase process and other sources. These projections also include projections on potential and contractual obligations assumed in these acquisitions. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized in determining fair value, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe utilize assumptions related to the useful lives and related salvage value of our property, plant and equipment in order to determine depreciation and amortization expense each period. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized in determining useful lives, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nTo estimate the useful life of our finite lived intangible assets we utilize assumptions of the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows. Generally this requires us to amortize our intangible assets based on the expected future cash flows (to the extent they are readily determinable) or on a straight-line basis (if they are not readily determinable) of the acquired contracts or customer relationships. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized in determining future cash flows, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe continually monitor our business, the business environment and the performance of our operations to determine if an event has occurred that indicates that a long-lived asset may be impaired. If an event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we may be required to utilize cash flow projections to assess our ability to recover the carrying value of our assets based on our long-lived assets' ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. This differs from our evaluation of goodwill, for which we perform an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill utilizing fair value estimates that primarily utilize discounted cash flows in the estimation process (as described above), and accordingly a reporting unit that has experienced a goodwill impairment may not experience a similar impairment of the underlying long-lived assets included in\nthat reporting unit. During 2018, we did not record impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. During 2017 and 2016, we recorded the following impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment:\n \u2022 During 2017, we incurred $82.2 million of impairments of our property, plant and equipment and intangible assets related to our MS&L West Coast operations, which resulted from decreasing forecasted cash flows to be generated by those operations. During 2018, we sold our MS&L West Coast operations for net proceeds of approximately $70.5 million, and recorded a $26.9 million of loss on long-lived assets associated with the sale. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 3 for a further discussion of the sale of these assets. \n \u2022 During 2016, we incurred a $31.4 million impairment of intangible assets related to our MS&L Trucking operations, which resulted from the impact of increased competition on our Trucking business and the loss of several key customer relationships that were acquired in 2013 to which the intangible assets related. \nProjected cash flows of our long-lived assets are generally based on current and anticipated future market conditions, which require significant judgment to make projections and assumptions about pricing, demand, competition, operating costs, construction costs, legal and regulatory issues and other factors that may extend many years into the future and are often outside of our control. If those cash flow projections indicate that the long-lived asset's carrying value is not recoverable, we record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. The estimate of fair value considers a number of factors, including the potential value we would receive if we sold the asset, discount rates and projected cash flows. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe continue to monitor our long-lived assets, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining carrying value of these long-lived assets in the future if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our long-lived assets' customers, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those investments.\nEquity Method Investments\nWe evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the equity method investment may be impaired and that impairment is other than temporary. If an event occurs, we evaluate the recoverability of our carrying value based on the fair value of the investment. If an impairment is indicated, we adjust the carrying values of the asset downward, if necessary, to their estimated fair values.\nWe estimate the fair value of our equity method investments based on a number of factors, including discount rates, projected cash flows, enterprise value and the potential value we would receive if we sold the equity method investment. Estimating projected cash flows requires us to make certain assumptions as it relates to the future operating performance of each of our equity method investments (which includes assumptions, among others, about estimating future operating margins and related future growth in those margins, contracting efforts and the cost and timing of facility expansions) and assumptions related to our equity method investments' customers, such as their future capital and operating plans and their financial condition. When considering operating performance, various factors are considered such as current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment, among others. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe continue to monitor our equity method investments, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining carrying value of these investments in the future if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our equity method investments' customers, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those investments.\nOur equity method investments have long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments in their underlying financial statements, and our equity investees apply similar accounting policies and have similar critical accounting estimates in assessing those assets for impairment as we do. During 2016, our PRBIC equity method investment recorded an impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets, and we reflected a $5.8 million reduction of our equity earnings from PRBIC related to our share of that impairment. Our Stagecoach Gas equity method investment has approximately $656.5 million of goodwill in its financial statements, which it assesses for impairment annually on December 31 or whenever events indicate that it is more likely than not that its fair value could be less than its carrying amount. This assessment requires Stagecoach Gas to make certain assumptions about its further operating performance (which includes assumptions, among others, about estimating future operating margins and related future growth in those margins, contracting efforts and the cost and timing of facility expansions, in addition to current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment). A\nsignificant decrease in the assumptions utilized by Stagecoach Gas could result in a significant reduction in our equity earnings from Stagecoach Gas. Our investment in Stagecoach Gas was approximately $830.4 million at December 31, 2018.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership interest to determine if the entity is a variable interest entity (VIE). Our interests in a VIE are referred to as variable interests. Variable interests can be contractual, ownership or other interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the VIE's assets. When we conclude that we hold an interest in a VIE we must determine if we are the entity's primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a VIE.\nWe consolidate any VIE when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary. We must disclose the nature of any interests in a VIE that is not consolidated. Significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a VIE and in evaluating our interest in a VIE. We use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a VIE. We evaluate the entity's need for continuing financial support; the equity holder's lack of a controlling financial interest; and/or if an equity holder's voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns. We evaluate our interests in a VIE to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. We use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the VIE, either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group. We continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests, including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions. As a result of this analysis, we concluded that our investment in Crestwood Permian is a VIE that we are not the primary beneficiary of, and as a result, we account for our investment in Crestwood Permian as an equity method investment.\nOur other equity investments are not considered to be VIEs. However, any future changes in the design or nature of the activities of these entities may require us to reconsider our conclusions associated with these entities. Such reconsideration would require the identification of the variable interests in the entity and a determination of which party is the entity's primary beneficiary. If an equity investment were considered a VIE and we were determined to be the primary beneficiary, the change could cause us to consolidate the entity. The consolidation of an entity that is currently accounted for under the equity method could have a significant impact on our financial statements. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6 for more information on our equity method investments.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nWe evaluate our overall business performance based primarily on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We do not utilize depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in our key measures because we focus our performance management on cash flow generation and our assets have long useful lives.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA - We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely accepted financial indicators of a company's operational performance and its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to our investors because it allows them to use the same performance measure analyzed internally by our management to evaluate the performance of our businesses and investments without regard to the manner in which they are financed or our capital structure. EBITDA is defined as income before income taxes, plus debt-related costs (interest and debt expense, net, and gain (loss) on modification/extinguishment of debt) and depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. Adjusted EBITDA considers the adjusted earnings impact of our unconsolidated affiliates by adjusting our equity earnings or losses from our unconsolidated affiliates to reflect our proportionate share (based on the distribution percentage) of their EBITDA, excluding impairments. Adjusted EBITDA also considers the impact of certain significant items, such as unit-based compensation charges, gains and losses on long-lived assets, impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, third party costs incurred related to potential and completed acquisitions, certain environmental remediation costs, the change in fair value of commodity inventory-related derivative contracts, costs associated with the realignment of our operations (including our Marketing, Supply and Logistics operations and other cost savings initiatives), and other transactions identified in a specific reporting period. The change in fair value of commodity inventory-related derivative contracts is considered in determining Adjusted EBITDA given that the timing of recognizing gains and losses on these derivative contracts differs from the recognition of revenue for the related underlying sale of inventory to which these derivatives relate. Changes in the fair value of other derivative contracts is not considered in determining Adjusted EBITDA given the relatively short-term nature of those derivative contracts. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, as they do not include deductions for items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest and income taxes, which are necessary to maintain our business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations may vary among entities, so our computation may not be comparable to measures used by other companies.\nSee our reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in Results of Operations below.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations (in millions).\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

and Processing\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nEBITDA for our gathering and processing segment increased by approximately $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. Our gathering and processing segment's costs of product/services sold decreased by approximately $713.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, while our revenues only decreased by $683.6 million year over year.\nOur gathering and processing segment's revenues and product costs were impacted by the modified retrospective adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, during the year ended December 31, 2018, which decreased its revenues and product costs by approximately $1,015.4 million and $1,026.8 million, respectively. Also impacting our gathering and processing segment's EBITDA during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, were lower revenues and product costs of approximately $30.2 million and $21.8 million, respectively, as a result of the deconsolidation of Crestwood New Mexico Pipeline LLC (Crestwood New Mexico) in 2017.\nThe remaining increase in our gathering and processing segment's revenues and costs of product/services sold of approximately $362.0 million and $334.8 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, was primarily\ndriven by our Arrow operations. Natural gas volumes and water volumes gathered by our Arrow system increased by 40% and 30%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. These favorable variances were driven by increased producer activity and expanded capacity on our Arrow system. In addition, the Bear Den processing plant was placed into service in late 2017, which increased natural gas volumes gathered and processed by the Arrow system. Arrow also experienced higher average prices on its agreements under which it purchases and sells crude oil as a result of the increase in crude oil prices in 2018 compared to 2017.\nOur gathering and processing segment's operations and maintenance expenses increased by approximately $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the increase in volumes related to our Arrow operations described above.\nOur gathering and processing segment's EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes a loss on long-lived assets of approximately $3.0 million, primarily related to the retirement and/or disposal of certain of our Arrow and Granite Wash gathering and processing assets.\nOur gathering and processing segment's EBITDA was favorably impacted by a net increase in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates of approximately $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. Equity earnings from our Jackalope equity investment increased by approximately $7.6 million primarily due to a 73% and 57% increase in its gathering and processing volumes during 2018 compared to 2017 resulting from increased producer activity on its system. Our equity earnings from our Crestwood Permian equity investment decreased by approximately $4.0 million during 2018 compared to 2017. Pursuant to the Crestwood Permian limited liability company agreement, we were allocated 100% of the equity earnings from Crestwood New Mexico through June 30, 2018. Subsequent to June 30, 2018, our equity earnings from Crestwood New Mexico were allocated based on our ownership percentage in Crestwood Permian, which is currently 50%.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nEBITDA for CEQP's gathering and processing segment increased by approximately $35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our gathering and processing segment's revenues increased by approximately $595.3 million compared to 2016, partially offset by an increase in costs of product/services sold of approximately $563.8 million during 2017 compared to 2016.\nThe increases in revenues and costs during the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily driven by our Arrow operations, which experienced a $611.0 million increase in revenues and a $578.5 million increase in costs of product/services compared to 2016. The increase in Arrow's revenues and costs was primarily driven by higher average prices on Arrow's agreements under which it purchases and sells crude oil. In addition, crude, gas and water volumes gathered by our Arrow system increased by 30%, 10% and 27%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, due to the connection of 97 wells on our Arrow system during 2017 compared to 48 wells during 2016.\nPartially offsetting the increase in our gathering and processing segment's revenues and costs from our Arrow operations during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, were lower revenues and costs of approximately $16.4 million and $10.6 million, respectively, from our Permian operations as a result of the deconsolidation of Crestwood New Mexico in June 2017. For a further discussion of this transaction, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6.\nOur gathering and processing segment's operations and maintenance expenses decreased by approximately $8.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, due to continued cost-reduction efforts undertaken in our operations and the deconsolidation of Crestwood New Mexico.\nOur gathering and processing segment's EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a loss on long-lived assets of approximately $14.4 million, primarily related to the retirement and/or disposition of certain of our Marcellus and Arrow gathering and processing assets.\nThe comparability of our G&P segment's EBITDA was impacted by an $8.6 million impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to our Marcellus operations. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies\u201d above and Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nOur gathering and processing segment's EBITDA was also impacted by a decrease in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates of approximately $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by a $10.3 million decrease in equity earnings from Jackalope resulting from a reduction in its revenues as a result of the restructuring of its contracts with Chesapeake effective January 1, 2017. Jackalope and Chesapeake replaced the cost-of-\nservice based contract with a fixed-fee gathering and processing contract that includes minimum revenue guarantees for a five to seven year period. Partially offsetting the decrease in equity earnings from Jackalope was an increase in equity earnings from our Crestwood Permian equity investment of approximately $8.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared 2016, primarily due to the contribution of Crestwood New Mexico to Crestwood Permian in June 2017, and the Nautilus system coming online in June 2017.\nStorage and Transportation\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nEBITDA for our storage and transportation segment increased by approximately $43.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The comparability of our storage and transportation segment's EBITDA year over year was impacted by a $57 million loss on contingent consideration recorded during 2017 related to our Stagecoach Gas joint venture as further described below.\nDuring 2017 and early 2018, several of COLT's firm rail loading agreements expired that provided COLT with take-or-pay revenues at rates that were higher than spot market rates. As a result, COLT's revenues decreased by approximately $16.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 despite its rail loading volumes increasing by 28% year-over-year. The increase in volumes was due to higher demand for rail loading services resulting from higher Bakken crude oil production and higher basis differentials between Bakken and the U.S. western and eastern markets.\nOur storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was also impacted by a net increase in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. Earnings from our Stagecoach Gas equity investment increased by approximately $4.0 million during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to our share of Stagecoach Gas' equity earnings increasing from 35% to 40% effective July 1, 2018. Effective July 1, 2019, our equity earnings from Stagecoach Gas will be allocated based on our ownership percentage, which is currently 50%. Partially offsetting this increase were lower equity earnings from our Tres Holdings equity investment of approximately $2.2 million due to higher repair and maintenance costs at the joint venture.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nEBITDA for CEQP's storage and transportation segment decreased by approximately $65.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our storage and transportation segment's revenues were lower due to a reduction in revenues of approximately $51.1 million from our COLT Hub operations compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in our rail throughput revenues from the expiration of two rail loading contracts in late 2016, a 58% decrease in rail loading volumes and lower margins resulting from higher average crude oil prices in the Bakken compared to other basins, which has decreased the demand and rates for our rail loading services in 2017 compared to 2016. Also impacting our storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was $44.9 million of goodwill impairments recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to our COLT Hub operations. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies\u201d above and Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nThe comparability of our storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was also impacted by a $57 million loss on contingent consideration recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to our Stagecoach Gas joint venture. Pursuant to the Stagecoach Gas limited liability company agreement, we may be required to make payments of up to $57 million to CEGP after December 31, 2020 if certain criteria are not met by Stagecoach Gas by December 31, 2020, including achieving certain performance targets on growth capital projects. These growth capital projects depend on the construction of other third-party expansion projects, and during 2017, those third-party projects experienced regulatory and other delays that caused Stagecoach Gas to delay its growth capital projects. Although Stagecoach Gas anticipates that these growth capital projects will be constructed in the future, it does not expect that these projects will produce meaningful operating results prior to December 31, 2020.\nOur storage and transportation segment's results was impacted by a $32.4 million loss recognized on the deconsolidation of our Northeast storage and transportation assets as a result of the contribution of these assets to the Stagecoach Gas joint venture in June 2016. The deconsolidation of the Northeast storage and transportation assets resulted in lower revenues and costs of product/services sold of approximately $74.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6 for a further discussion of the deconsolidation of our NE S&T assets.\nWe experienced lower operations and maintenance expenses of approximately $17.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily as a result of the deconsolidation of the Northeast storage and transportation assets. In addition, in June 2016, the Matagorda County court issued a final judgment related to Tres Palacios' 2012 and 2013 property tax years which resulted in CEQP recording additional net property taxes (including interest and penalties) of approximately $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was impacted by an increase in earnings from our unconsolidated affiliates. As discussed above, in June 2016, we deconsolidated our Northeast storage and transportation assets as a result of the Stagecoach Gas transaction and began accounting for our 50% equity interest in Stagecoach Gas under the equity method of accounting. We recognized equity earnings from Stagecoach Gas of approximately $25.3 million and $15.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Earnings from our Tres Holdings equity investment increased by approximately $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to property tax accruals recorded by Tres Holdings during 2016.\nMarketing, Supply and Logistics\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nEBITDA for our marketing, supply and logistics segment increased by approximately $76.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The comparability of our marketing, supply and logistics segment's results was impacted by the sale of certain of our assets during 2018 and 2017 and approximately $121.0 million of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairments recorded during 2017, all of which are further described below.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $26.9 million loss on long-lived assets related to the sale of our West Coast facilities in October 2018, which also resulted in lower revenues and costs of product/services sold of approximately $81.4 million and $71.4 million in 2018 compared to 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $33.6 million gain related to the sale of US Salt, which also resulted in lower revenues and costs of product/services sold of approximately $59.8 million and $34.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017.\nEBITDA for our marketing, supply and logistics segment (excluding the impacts from the sale of our West Coast and US Salt assets described above) was also impacted by an increase in its revenues and costs of product/services sold of approximately $614.3 million and $574.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017.\nOur crude and natural gas marketing operations experienced an increase in its revenues and product costs of approximately $564.5 million and $557.6 million. These increases were driven by higher crude marketing volumes due to increased marketing activity surrounding our crude-related operations.\nThe remaining $32.6 million increase in our revenues (net of costs of product/services sold) during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 was driven by our NGL marketing and logistics operations. Included in our costs of product/services sold was a gain of $29.6 million and a loss of $31.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Of the $29.6 million gain in 2018, approximately $18.3 million related to the change in fair value of commodity inventory-related derivative contracts that had not yet settled in cash at December 31, 2018. The remaining increase in our revenues and costs of product/services sold of our NGL marketing and logistics operations was primarily the result of our ability to capture more marketing opportunities to purchase and sell NGLs given the unusually cold weather during 2018. In addition, we experienced increased demand for trucking, rail, storage and terminal services as a result of an expanded US NGL supply base and market dislocations caused by increased NGL supplies from various high growth regions and regional pipeline outages.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our marketing, supply and logistics segment's operations and maintenance expenses decreased by approximately $12.6 million compared to 2017, primarily due to the sale of our West Coast and US Salt assets described above, in addition to efforts to realign certain of its operations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nEBITDA for our marketing, supply and logistics segment increased by approximately $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The comparability of our marketing, supply and logistics segment's results was significantly impacted by goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairments of $121.0 million recorded during 2017 and goodwill and intangible asset impairments of $140.5 million recorded during 2016. For a further\ndiscussion of our impairments recorded during 2017 and 2016, see Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies\u201d above and Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nOur supply and logistics operations experienced an increase in revenues and costs of product/services sold of $465.0 million and $457.9 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. During 2016, we experienced unseasonably warm weather which resulted in lower demand for NGLs compared to increased demand experienced during 2017. The costs of product/services sold increase includes a loss of $31.2 million and $7.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to our commodity-based derivative contracts. These changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts resulted from higher average NGL prices during 2017 compared to 2016, which resulted in an increase in our liabilities from price risk management activities associated with contracts that provide fixed prices on future sales of our NGL inventory.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, our storage and terminals operations (including our West Coast operations) experienced a $173.6 million and $174.4 million increase in revenues and costs of product/services sold, respectively, compared to 2016. These increases were primarily driven by increases in NGL prices during the year ended December 31, 2017. Although our net operating results were relatively consistent during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, we experienced NGL market headwinds in the Northeast during 2017, with NGL exports and other market dynamics causing price differentials to narrow between purchasing NGLs in the summer (which are then stored in our NGL facilities) and selling NGLs in the winter. These dynamics also caused the rates that we are able to charge for storing NGLs in our facilities to decline from their historical levels. Also during 2017, our West Coast customers also experienced headwinds, with both producers and refineries located in the Western U.S. experiencing regulatory challenges and an inflow of NGLs from the Eastern U.S. This caused demand for the gathering, processing and logistics services from our West Coast operations to remain relatively flat in 2017 compared to 2016. Considering the fact that the net operating results of our storage and terminals operations (including West Coast) have been relatively consistent over the past several years, we do not anticipate that these operations will grow as fast or to the degree that we expected when we merged with Inergy, LP in 2013 given current market dynamics, which we believe will continue for the foreseeable future.\nRevenues and costs of product/services sold from our crude and natural gas marketing operations increased by approximately $261.9 million and $260.5 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. These increases were primarily driven by higher crude marketing volumes due to increased marketing activity surrounding our Bakken crude-related operations resulting from higher Bakken crude oil production and higher basis differentials between Bakken and the U.S. western and eastern markets.\nOur NGL and crude trucking operations continued to experience lower operating results in 2017 compared to 2016, with a $12.4 million and $5.7 million decrease in revenues and costs of product/services sold during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. This decrease was primarily a result of the realignment of our trucking operations in 2017 to reduce the size of our trucking fleet in response to the continued decline in demand for trucking services due to the continued lower commodity price environment.\nOur marketing, supply and logistic segment's operations and maintenance expenses increased by approximately $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. In 2016, we received a $3.1 million property tax refund related to our West Coast operations.\nIn December 2017, we sold 100% of our equity interests in US Salt to an affiliate of Kissner Group Holdings LP for net proceeds of approximately $223.6 million, and we recognized a gain of approximately $33.6 million from the sale. For a further discussion of this sale, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 3.\nOther EBITDA Results\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our general and administrative costs decreased compared to 2017, while we experienced an increase in these costs during 2017 compared to 2016. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred approximately $1.3 million and $2.2 million of transactional and other general and administrative costs related primarily to the realignment initiatives we undertook related to realigning our Marketing, Supply and Logistics operations. In addition, our unit-based compensation charges increased by $3.0 million from 2017 to 2018 and by $6.3 million from 2016 to 2017 due to higher average awards outstanding under our long-term incentive plans.\nItems not affecting EBITDA include the following:\nDepreciation, Amortization and Accretion Expense. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our depreciation, amortization and accretion expense decreased compared to 2017 and 2016, primarily due to the sale of our West Coast assets and US Salt operations during 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the deconsolidation of our Crestwood New Mexico operations in 2017. For a further discussion of these transactions, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Notes 3 and 6.\nInterest and Debt Expense, Net. During the year ended December 31, 2018, interest and debt expense, net was relatively flat compared to 2017, while we experienced a decrease of approximately $25.7 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The net decrease was primarily due to repayments of amounts previously outstanding under Crestwood Midstream's senior notes in 2017 and late 2016 .\nThe following table provides a summary of our interest and debt expense, net (in millions).\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes\n</td> <td>72.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other debt-related costs\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross interest and debt expense\n</td> <td>104.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: capitalized interest\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and debt expense, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGain (Loss) on Modification/Extinguishment of Debt. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a loss on modification of debt of approximately $0.9 million in conjunction with amending and restating Crestwood Midstream's senior secured revolving credit facility. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $37.7 million in conjunction with the tender of the principal amounts previously outstanding under Crestwood Midstream's senior notes due in 2020 and 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $10.0 million in conjunction with the early tender of a portion of the principal amounts previously outstanding under Crestwood Midstream's senior notes due in 2020 and 2022.\nLiquidity and Sources of Capital\nCrestwood Equity is a holding company that derives all of its operating cash flow from its operating subsidiaries. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated by operating activities from our subsidiaries, distributions from our joint ventures, borrowings under the CMLP credit facility, and sales of equity and debt securities. Our equity investments use cash from their respective operations to fund their operating activities, maintenance and growth capital expenditures, and service their outstanding indebtedness. We believe our liquidity sources and operating cash flows are sufficient to address our future operating, debt service and capital requirements.\nWe make cash quarterly distributions to our common unitholders within approximately 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter in an aggregate amount equal to our available cash for such quarter. We also pay cash quarterly distributions of approximately $15 million to our preferred unitholders. We believe our operating cash flows will well exceed cash distributions to our partners and our preferred unitholders at current levels, and as a result, we will have substantial operating cash flows as a source of liquidity for our growth capital expenditures.\nIn October 2018, Crestwood Midstream entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Second Amended Credit Agreement). The Second Amended Credit Agreement provides for a five-year $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in October 2023 and is available to fund acquisitions, working capital and internal growth projects and for general partnership purposes. Interest rates under the Second Amended Credit Agreement were reduced by 0.25%, and the debt covenants under the Second Amended Credit Agreement are materially consistent with those under the previous credit facility. For a further discussion of the Second Amended Credit Agreement, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 9. As of December 31, 2018, we had $524.0 million of available capacity under the credit facility considering the most restrictive debt covenants in the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants applicable to the credit facility and our senior notes. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 9 for a more detailed description of the credit facility and senior notes.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a summary of Crestwood Equity's cash flows by category (in millions):\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>255.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>346.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>(241.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>867.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(294.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,212.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur operating cash flows decreased by $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. We experienced higher revenues and costs primarily from our gathering and processing segment's Arrow operations of $362.0 million and $334.8 million, respectively, and higher revenues (net of costs of product/services sold) from our marketing, supply and logistics segment's NGL marketing and logistics operations of approximately $32.6 million . Offsetting these higher revenues and costs was a $16.3 million decrease in operating revenues from our COLT Hub operations and a net cash outflow from working capital requirements of approximately $47.2 million. For a further discussion of our segments' results, see Results of Operations above.\nOur operating cash flows decreased approximately $90.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $125.6 million decrease in our storage and transportation segment's revenues primarily resulting from the deconsolidation of our Northeast storage and transportation assets and a reduction in rail throughput revenues from our COLT operations. This was partially offset by a $1,488.5 million increase in revenues from our gathering and processing and marketing, supply and logistics operations discussed above, offset by a $1,449.6 million increase in costs of product/services sold primarily related to these segments' operations.\nInvesting Activities\nCapital Expenditures. The energy midstream business is capital intensive, requiring significant investments for the acquisition or development of new facilities. We categorize our capital expenditures as either:\n \u2022 growth capital expenditures, which are made to construct additional assets, expand and upgrade existing systems, or acquire additional assets; or \n \u2022 maintenance capital expenditures, which are made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets, extend their useful lives or comply with regulatory requirements. \nDuring 2019, we anticipate growth capital expenditures of approximately $275 million to $325 million, which includes contributions to our equity investments related to their capital projects. In addition, we expect to spend between approximately $20 million to $25 million on maintenance capital expenditures and approximately $25 million to $30 million on capital expenditures that are directly reimbursable by our customers. We anticipate that our growth and reimbursable capital expenditures in 2019 will increase the services we can provide to our customers and the operating efficiencies of our systems. We expect to finance our capital expenditures with a combination of cash generated by our operating subsidiaries, distributions received from our equity investments and borrowings under our credit facility.\nWe have identified additional growth capital project opportunities for each of our reporting segments. Additional commitments or expenditures will be made at our discretion, and any discontinuation of the construction of these projects will likely result in less future cash flows and earnings. The following table summarizes our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in millions):\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>267.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(1)\n</td> <td>17.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases of property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>305.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Represents purchases of property, plant and equipment that are reimbursable by third parties. \nIn addition to the capital expenditures described in the table above, our cash flows from investing activities were also impacted by the following significant items during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n \u2022 In October 2018, we sold our West Coast facilities to a third party for net proceeds of approximately $70.5 million; \n \u2022 In December 2017, we sold 100% of our equity interests in US Salt to an affiliate of Kissner Group Holdings LP for net proceeds of approximately $223.6 million; \n \u2022 In June 2016, we contributed to Stagecoach Gas the entities owning the NE S&T assets, CEGP contributed $975 million in exchange for a 50% equity interest in Stagecoach Gas, and Stagecoach Gas distributed to us the net cash proceeds received from CEGP; and \n \u2022 During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we contributed approximately $64.4 million, $58.0 million and $12.4 million, respectively, to our equity investments to fund their expansion projects and their operating activities. \nFinancing Activities\nSignificant items impacting our financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 included the following:\nEquity Transactions\n \u2022 In December 2017, Crestwood Niobrara redeemed 100% of the outstanding Series A preferred units issued to a subsidiary of General Electric Capital Corporation and GE Structured Finance, Inc. (collectively, GE) for an aggregate purchase price of $202.7 million and issued $175 million of new Series A-2 preferred units to CN Jackalope Holdings LLC (Jackalope Holdings). For a further discussion of this transaction, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 12. We began making distributions to Jackalope Holdings on its Series A-2 preferred units in April 2018, and during the year ended December 31, 2018, we distributed approximately $9.9 million to our non-controlling partner. During each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we distributed approximately $15.2 million to GE for its non-controlling interest in Crestwood Niobrara; \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, our distributions to partners increased by approximately $3.2 million compared to 2017 due to an increase our common unitholders. Our distributions to partners decreased by approximately $52.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a reduction in distributions paid per limited partner unit from $1.375 to $0.60 beginning with the distribution paid in May 2016; \n \u2022 During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we made cash distributions of approximately $60.1 million and $15 million to our preferred unitholders. Prior to September 30, 2017, we paid quarterly distributions to our preferred unitholders by issuing additional preferred units; \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received net proceeds of approximately $15.2 million from the issuance of CEQP common units; and \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, our taxes paid for unit-based compensation vesting increased by approximately $1.9 million compared to 2017, and increased by approximately $4.7 million during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher vesting of unit-based compensation awards. \nDebt Transactions\n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, our debt-related transactions resulted in net borrowings of approximately $253.4 million compared to net repayments of approximately $76.3 million in 2017 and net repayments of $974.5 million in 2016. During 2017 and 2016, we redeemed all amounts previously outstanding under Crestwood Midstream's senior notes due in 2020 and 2022. During 2017, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2025. For a further discussion of these and other debt-related transactions, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 9. \nContractual Obligations\nWe are party to various contractual obligations. A portion of these obligations are reflected in our financial statements, such as long-term debt and other accrued liabilities, while other obligations, such as operating leases, capital commitments and contractual interest amounts are not reflected on our balance sheet. The following table and discussion summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in millions):\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,278.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,779.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest(1)\n</td> <td>100.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>198.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>497.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>68.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future minimum payments under operating leases(2)\n</td> <td>22.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future minimum payments under capital leases(2)\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed price commodity purchase commitments(3)\n</td> <td>784.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>894.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments and other contractual obligations(4)\n</td> <td>79.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,057.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>347.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,458.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>574.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,437.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) $578.2 million of our long-term debt is variable interest rate debt at the Alternate Base rate or Eurodollar rate plus an applicable spread.

We are not the primary beneficiary of Crestwood Permian and as a result, we account for our investment in Crestwood Permian as an equity method investment. For a further discussion of our investment in Crestwood Permian, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes.\nThis report, including information included or incorporated by reference herein, contains forward-looking statements concerning the financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business of our company and its subsidiaries. These forward-looking statements include:\n \u2022 statements that are not historical in nature, including, but not limited to: (i) our belief that anticipated cash from operations, cash distributions from entities that we control, and borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for the foreseeable future; (ii) our belief that we do not have material potential liability in connection with legal proceedings that would have a significant financial impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows; and (iii) our belief that our assets will continue to benefit from the development of unconventional shale plays as significant supply basins; and \n \u2022 statements preceded by, followed by or that contain forward-looking terminology including the words believe,\u201d expect,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d intend\u201d or the negation thereof, or similar expressions. \nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements due to, among others, the following factors:\n \u2022 our ability to successfully implement our business plan for our assets and operations; \n \u2022 governmental legislation and regulations; \n \u2022 industry factors that influence the supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs; \n \u2022 industry factors that influence the demand for services in the markets (particularly unconventional shale plays) in which we provide services; \n \u2022 weather conditions; \n \u2022 the availability of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, and the price of those commodities, to consumers relative to the price of alternative and competing fuels; \n \u2022 economic conditions; \n \u2022 costs or difficulties related to the integration of acquisitions and success of our joint ventures' operations; \n \u2022 environmental claims; \n \u2022 operating hazards and other risks incidental to the provision of midstream services, including gathering, compressing, treating, processing, fractionating, transporting and storing energy products (i.e., crude oil, NGLs and natural gas) and related products (i.e., produced water); \n \u2022 interest rates; \n \u2022 the price and availability of debt and equity financing, including our ability to raise capital through alternatives like joint ventures; and \n \u2022 the ability to sell or monetize assets, to reduce indebtedness, to repurchase our equity securities, to make strategic investments, or for other general partnership purposes. \nWe have described under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, additional factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those described in the forward-looking statements. Other factors that we have not identified in this report could also have this effect.\nOverview\nWe own and operate crude oil, natural gas and NGL midstream assets and operations. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, we are a fully-integrated midstream solution provider that specializes in connecting shale-based energy supplies to key demand markets. We conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Crestwood Midstream, a limited partnership that owns and operates gathering, processing, storage, and transportation assets in the most prolific shale plays across the United States.\nOur Company\nWe provide broad-ranging services to customers across the crude oil, natural gas and NGL sector of the energy value chain. Our midstream infrastructure is geographically located in or near significant supply basins, especially developed and emerging liquids-rich and crude oil shale plays, across the United States. Our operating assets, including those of our joint ventures, primarily include:\n \u2022 natural gas facilities with approximately 2.9 Bcf/d of gathering capacity, 0.9 Bcf/d of processing capacity, 75.8 Bcf of certificated working storage capacity and 1.6 Bcf/d of firm transportation capacity; \n \u2022 crude oil facilities with approximately 125,000 Bbls/d of gathering capacity, 1.9 MMBbls of storage capacity, 20,000 Bbls/d of transportation capacity and 180,000 Bbls/d of rail loading capacity; \n \u2022 NGL facilities with approximately 2.5 MMBbls of storage capacity, as well as our portfolio of transportation assets (consisting of truck and rail terminals, truck/trailer units and rail cars) capable of transporting approximately 1.3 MMBbls/d of NGLs; and \n \u2022 produced water gathering facilities with approximately 90,000 Bbls/d of gathering capacity. \nOur financial statements reflect three operating and reporting segments: (i) gathering and processing, which includes our natural gas, crude oil and produced water G&P operations; (ii) storage and transportation, which includes our natural gas and crude oil storage and transportation operations; and (iii) marketing, supply and logistics, which includes our NGL marketing and logistics business, crude oil storage and rail loading facilities and fleet. For a description of the assets included in our operating and reporting segments, see Part I, Item 1. Business.\nGathering and Processing\nOur G&P operations and investments provide gathering, compression, treating, and processing services to producers in multiple unconventional resource plays in North Dakota, West Virginia, Texas, New Mexico, Wyoming and Arkansas, and we have established footprints in core of the core\u201d areas of many of the largest shale plays. We believe that our strategy of focusing on prolific, low-cost shale plays positions us well to (i) generate greater returns in varying commodity price environments, (ii) capture greater upside economics when development activity occurs, and (iii) in general, better manage through commodity price cycles and production changes associated therewith.\nStorage and Transportation\nOur S&T operations and investments consist of our crude oil terminals in the Bakken and Powder River Basin and our natural gas storage and transportation assets in the Northeast and Texas Gulf Coast.\nMarketing, Supply and Logistics\nOur MS&L segment consists of our NGL marketing and logistics operations located in over 30 states, including Florida, Indiana, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. We utilize our trucking and rail fleet, processing and storage facilities, and contracted storage and pipeline capacity on a portfolio basis to provide integrated supply and logistics solutions to producers, refiners and other customers.\nOutlook and Trends\nOur business objective is to create long-term value for our unitholders. We expect to create long-term value by consistently generating stable operating margins and improved cash flows from operations by prudently financing our investments, maximizing throughput on our assets, and effectively controlling our operating and administrative costs. Our business strategy depends, in part, on our ability to provide increased services to our customers at competitive fees, including opportunities to expand our services resulting from expansions, organic growth projects and acquisitions that can be financed appropriately.\nWe have taken a number of strategic steps to better position the Company as a stronger, better capitalized company that can over time accretively grow cash flows and sustainably resume growing our distributions. Those strategic steps included (i) simplifying our corporate structure to eliminate our incentive distribution rights (IDRs) and create better alignment of interests with our unitholders; (ii) divesting assets to reduce approximately $1 billion of long-term debt to ensure long-term balance sheet strength; (iii) realigning our operating structure to significantly reduce operating and administrative expenses; (iv)\nforming strategic joint ventures to enhance our competitive position around certain operating assets; and (v) focusing our growth capital expenditures on our highest return organic projects around our core growth assets in the Bakken Shale, Powder River Basin and Delaware Permian. We will remain focused on efficiently allocating capital expenditures by investing in accretive, organic growth projects, maintaining low-cost operations (through increased operating efficiencies and cost discipline) and maintaining our balance sheet strength through continued financial discipline. We expect to focus on expansion and greenfield opportunities to provide midstream services for crude oil, natural gas, and produced water, including gathering, storage and terminalling, condensate stabilization, truck loading/unloading options and connections to third party pipelines and produced water gathering, disposal and recycling in the Bakken Shale, Powder River Basin and Delaware Permian in the near term, while closely monitoring longer-term expansion opportunities in the northeast Marcellus. As a result, the Company is well positioned to execute its business plan and capitalize on the improving market conditions around many of our core assets.\nWhile market conditions remain challenging around some of our assets, the Company continues to be positioned to generate consistent results in a low commodity price environment without sacrificing revenue upside as market conditions improve. For example, many of our more mature G&P assets are supported by long-term, core acreage dedications in shale plays that are economic to varying degrees based upon natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices, the availability of infrastructure to flow production to market, and the operational and financial condition of our diverse customer base. In addition, a substantial portion of our midstream investments are based on fixed-fee or minimum volume commitment agreements that ensure a minimum level of cash flow regardless of actual commodity prices or volumetric throughput. Over time, we expect cash flows from our more mature, non-core, assets to stabilize and potentially increase with the improving commodity price environment, while the growth from our core assets in the Bakken Shale, Powder River Basin, Delaware Permian and northeast Marcellus drive significant growth to the Company.\nSegment Highlights\nBelow is a discussion of events that highlight our core business and financing activities. Through continued execution of our plan, we have materially improved the strategic and financial position of the Company and expect to capitalize on increasing opportunities in an improving but competitive market environment, which will position us to achieve our chief business objective to create long-term value for our unitholders.\nGathering and Processing\nBakken. In the Bakken, we are expanding and upgrading our Arrow system water handling facilities and increasing natural gas capacity on the system, which should allow for substantial growth in volumetric throughput across all of our crude oil, produced water and natural gas gathering systems. In addition, we are constructing a 120 MMcf/d cryogenic plant that we anticipate will be placed in-service in the third quarter of 2019 to fulfill 100% of the processing requirements for producers on the Arrow system upon expiration of third-party processing contracts in the third quarter 2019. Upon completion of the expansion, we expect to have 150 MMcf/d of gas processing capacity in the Bakken. We believe the expansion of our gas processing capacity on the Arrow system will, among other things, spur greater development activity around the Arrow system, allow us to provide greater flow assurance to our producer customers and reduce flaring of natural gas, and reduce the downstream constraints currently experienced by producers on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.\nPowder River Basin. In the Powder River Basin, our Jackalope joint venture with Williams continues to benefit from increased drilling activity and better than anticipated well results. Jackalope is expanding its gathering system and Bucking Horse processing plant to increase processing capacity to 345 MMcf/d in late 2019/early 2020. The Phase 2 Jackalope expansion also includes gathering, compression and a second processing plant which will add an additional 200 MMcf/d to the Jackalope system.\nDelaware Permian. In the Delaware Permian, we have identified gathering and processing and transportation opportunities in and around our existing assets, including our Crestwood Permian joint venture. Crestwood Permian Basin owns and operates the Nautilus system in SWEPI's operated position in the Delaware Permian. Crestwood Permian Basin provides gathering, dehydration, compression and liquids handling services to SWEPI under a 20-year fixed-fee gathering agreement. SWEPI has dedicated to Crestwood Permian Basin the gathering rights for SWEPI's gas production across a large acreage position in Loving, Reeves, Ward and Culberson Counties, Texas. The Nautilus gathering system will be constructed to ultimately include 194 miles of low pressure gathering lines, 36 miles of high pressure trunklines and centralized compression facilities which are expandable over time as production increases, producing gas gathering capacity of approximately 250 MMcf/d. In addition, the Orla processing plant was further expanded and integrated in July 2018 to connect the Nautilus gas gathering system to the Orla plant.\nMarketing, Supply and Logistics\nIn October 2018, we sold our West Coast facilities to a third party for net proceeds of approximately $70.5 million. The West Coast assets included a gas gathering and processing system, fractionator, butamer and various rail and truck terminal and storage facilities located in California, Nevada, Wyoming and Utah.\nDuring 2017 and 2018, we realigned our Marketing, Supply and Logistics operations, including leadership changes, cost reductions, resizing of our truck and rail fleet, and the implementation of rate and profitability key performance indicators. We believe these changes will result in improved profitability and operating efficiencies for this business in the future.\nRegulatory Matters\nMany aspects of the energy midstream sector, such as crude-by-rail activities and pipeline integrity, have experienced increased regulatory oversight over the past few years. However, under the current Presidential Administration, we anticipate changes in policy that could lessen the degree of regulatory scrutiny we face in the near term.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was passed by the U.S. Congress, which modified several aspects of the U.S. income tax code beginning in 2018. The Tax Act requires that the business interest deduction be limited to the sum of business interest income and 30% of adjusted taxable income. For the purposes of this limitation, adjusted taxable income will be computed without regard to any business interest expense or business interest income, and in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, any deduction allowable for depreciation, amortization, or depletion.\nEffective December 2017, the Tax Act changed several provisions of the federal tax code, including a reduction in the maximum corporate tax rate. On March 15, 2018, the FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes (Revised Policy Statement) stating that it will no longer permit master limited partnerships to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. Also on March 15, 2018, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) proposing rules for implementation of the Revised Policy Statement and the corporate income tax rate reduction with respect to pipeline rates. On July 18, 2018, the FERC issued an order denying requests for rehearing and clarification of its Revised Policy Statement because it is a non-binding policy and parties will have the opportunity to address the policy as applied in future cases. In the rehearing order, the FERC clarified that a pipeline organized as a master limited partnership will not be precluded in a future proceeding from providing support that it is entitled to an income tax allowance and demonstrating that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a double-recovery of investors' income tax costs. Also on July 18, 2018, the FERC issued a Final Rule adopting procedures that are generally the same as proposed in the NOPR with a few clarifications and modifications. With limited exceptions, the Final Rule requires all FERC-regulated natural gas pipelines that have cost-based rates for service to make a one-time Form No. 501-G filing providing certain financial information and to select one of four options: (i) file a limited NGA Section 4 filing reducing its rates only as required related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Revised Policy Statement; (ii) commit to filing a general NGA Section 4 rate case in the near future; (iii) file a statement explaining why an adjustment to rates is not needed; or (iv) take no other action.\nOn March 15, 2018, the FERC also issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) requesting comments about whether, and if so how, the FERC should address changes relating to accumulated deferred income taxes and bonus depreciation. Comments on the NOI were filed by May 21, 2018, and any actions the FERC may take following receipt of these responses to the NOI are unknown at this time, but could impact the rates midstream companies are permitted to charge its customers for transportation services in the future.\nIn addition, the FERC issued a NOI on April 19, 2018 (Certificate Policy Statement NOI), thereby initiating a review of its policies on certification of natural gas pipelines, including an examination of its long-standing Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities, issued in 1999, that is used to determine whether to grant certificates for new pipeline projects. Comments on the Certificate Policy Statement NOI were due on July 25, 2018, and we are unable to predict what, if any, changes may be proposed as a result of the NOI that will affect our natural gas pipeline business or when such proposals, if any, might become effective. We do not expect that any change in this policy would affect us in a materially different manner than any other similarly sized natural gas pipeline company operating in the United States.\nAlthough we do not have any consolidated operations that have FERC-regulated pipelines, two of our equity investments (Stagecoach Gas and Tres Holdings) have FERC-regulated operations. These equity investments receive revenues from contracts that primarily have market-based rates or negotiated rates that are not tied to cost-of-service rates, and we currently do not expect rates subject to negotiated rates or market-based rates to be affected by the Revised Policy Statement, the Final Rule or any final regulations that may result from the NOI. As a result, we currently do not believe that the Revised Policy Statement, the Final Rule or NOI will have a material impact on our results of operations, but we continue to monitor\ndevelopments at the FERC related to these matters to assess whether the final regulations could have an impact on the future results of our equity investments.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to select appropriate accounting estimates and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider our critical accounting estimates to be those that require difficult, complex, or subjective judgment necessary in accounting for inherently uncertain matters and those that could significantly influence our financial results based on changes in those judgments. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ materially from those estimates. We have discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the board of directors of our general partner.\nGoodwill\nOur goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid for a business over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on December 31, and whenever events indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit could be less than its carrying amount. This evaluation requires us to compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired.\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on a number of factors, including discount rates, projected cash flows and the potential value we would receive if we sold the reporting unit. We also compare the total fair value of our reporting units to our overall enterprise value, which considers the market value for our common and preferred units. Estimating projected cash flows requires us to make certain assumptions as it relates to the future operating performance of each of our reporting units (which includes assumptions, among others, about estimating future operating margins and related future growth in those margins, contracting efforts and the cost and timing of facility expansions) and assumptions related to our customers, such as their future capital and operating plans and their financial condition. When considering operating performance, various factors are considered such as current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment, among others. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates. If the assumptions embodied in the projections prove inaccurate, we could incur a future impairment charge. In addition, the use of the income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units (see further discussion of the income approach below) could result in a different fair value if we had utilized a market approach, or a combination thereof.\nWe acquired substantially all of our reporting units in 2013, 2012 and 2011, which required us to record the assets, liabilities and goodwill of each of those reporting units at fair value on the date they were acquired. As a result, any level of decrease in the forecasted cash flows of these businesses or increases in the discount rates utilized to value those businesses from their respective acquisition dates would likely result in the fair value of the reporting unit falling below the carrying value of the reporting unit, and could result in an assessment of whether that reporting unit's goodwill is impaired.\nCurrent commodity prices are significantly lower compared to commodity prices during 2014, and that decrease has adversely impacted forecasted cash flows, discount rates and stock/unit prices for most companies in the midstream industry, including us. In light of these circumstances, we evaluated the carrying value of our reporting units and determined it was more likely than not that the goodwill associated with several of our reporting units was impaired and as a result, we recorded goodwill impairments on several of our reporting units during 2017 and 2016.\nOn January 1, 2018, we combined the four reporting units included in our MS&L segment into one NGL Marketing and Logistics reporting unit for the purpose of evaluating goodwill for impairment on an ongoing basis as shown in the table below. At January 1, 2018, the goodwill for these reporting units was approximately $101.7 million. We combined these reporting units based on a strategic shift in the way in which we manage, operate and report our NGL operations as an integrated platform instead of as four individual stand-alone operations. We attributed approximately $9.0 million of the goodwill associated with our NGL Marketing and Logistics reporting unit to the West Coast facilities during 2018, and this goodwill was written off in conjunction with the sale of the West Coast assets. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 3 for a further discussion of the sale of our West Coast assets. We did not record any other impairments of our goodwill during 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the goodwill impairments of our reporting units during 2017 and 2016 (in millions):\n\nWe have two reporting units with goodwill associated with them at December 31, 2018 (Arrow and NGL Marketing and Logistics). We continue to monitor our remaining goodwill, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining goodwill in the future if we experience a significant sustained decrease in the market value of our common or preferred units or if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our customers on our remaining operations with goodwill, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those businesses. A 5% decrease in the forecasted cash flows or a 1% increase in the discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of our businesses would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment of either of our reporting units.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets consist of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that have been obtained through multiple historical business combinations and property, plant and equipment that has been constructed in recent years. The initial recording of a majority of these long-lived assets was at fair value, which is estimated by management primarily utilizing market-related information and other projections on the performance of the assets acquired. Management reviews this information to determine its reasonableness in comparison to the assumptions utilized in determining the purchase price of the assets in addition to other market-based information that was received through the purchase process and other sources. These projections also include projections on potential and contractual obligations assumed in these acquisitions. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized in determining fair value, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe utilize assumptions related to the useful lives and related salvage value of our property, plant and equipment in order to determine depreciation and amortization expense each period. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized in determining useful lives, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nTo estimate the useful life of our finite lived intangible assets we utilize assumptions of the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows. Generally this requires us to amortize our intangible assets based on the expected future cash flows (to the extent they are readily determinable) or on a straight-line basis (if they are not readily determinable) of the acquired contracts or customer relationships. Due to the imprecise nature of the projections and assumptions utilized in determining future cash flows, actual results can, and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe continually monitor our business, the business environment and the performance of our operations to determine if an event has occurred that indicates that a long-lived asset may be impaired. If an event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we may be required to utilize cash flow projections to assess our ability to recover the carrying value of our assets based on our long-lived assets' ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. This differs from our evaluation of goodwill, for which we perform an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill utilizing fair value estimates that primarily utilize discounted cash flows in the estimation process (as described above), and accordingly a reporting unit that has experienced a goodwill impairment may not experience a similar impairment of the underlying long-lived assets included in\nthat reporting unit. During 2018, we did not record impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. During 2017 and 2016, we recorded the following impairments of our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment:\n \u2022 During 2017, we incurred $82.2 million of impairments of our property, plant and equipment and intangible assets related to our MS&L West Coast operations, which resulted from decreasing forecasted cash flows to be generated by those operations. During 2018, we sold our MS&L West Coast operations for net proceeds of approximately $70.5 million, and recorded a $26.9 million of loss on long-lived assets associated with the sale. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 3 for a further discussion of the sale of these assets. \n \u2022 During 2016, we incurred a $31.4 million impairment of intangible assets related to our MS&L Trucking operations, which resulted from the impact of increased competition on our Trucking business and the loss of several key customer relationships that were acquired in 2013 to which the intangible assets related. \nProjected cash flows of our long-lived assets are generally based on current and anticipated future market conditions, which require significant judgment to make projections and assumptions about pricing, demand, competition, operating costs, construction costs, legal and regulatory issues and other factors that may extend many years into the future and are often outside of our control. If those cash flow projections indicate that the long-lived asset's carrying value is not recoverable, we record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. The estimate of fair value considers a number of factors, including the potential value we would receive if we sold the asset, discount rates and projected cash flows. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe continue to monitor our long-lived assets, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining carrying value of these long-lived assets in the future if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our long-lived assets' customers, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those investments.\nEquity Method Investments\nWe evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the equity method investment may be impaired and that impairment is other than temporary. If an event occurs, we evaluate the recoverability of our carrying value based on the fair value of the investment. If an impairment is indicated, we adjust the carrying values of the asset downward, if necessary, to their estimated fair values.\nWe estimate the fair value of our equity method investments based on a number of factors, including discount rates, projected cash flows, enterprise value and the potential value we would receive if we sold the equity method investment. Estimating projected cash flows requires us to make certain assumptions as it relates to the future operating performance of each of our equity method investments (which includes assumptions, among others, about estimating future operating margins and related future growth in those margins, contracting efforts and the cost and timing of facility expansions) and assumptions related to our equity method investments' customers, such as their future capital and operating plans and their financial condition. When considering operating performance, various factors are considered such as current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment, among others. Due to the imprecise nature of these projections and assumptions, actual results can and often do, differ from our estimates.\nWe continue to monitor our equity method investments, and we could experience additional impairments of the remaining carrying value of these investments in the future if we receive additional negative information about market conditions or the intent of our equity method investments' customers, which could negatively impact the forecasted cash flows or discount rates utilized to determine the fair value of those investments.\nOur equity method investments have long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments in their underlying financial statements, and our equity investees apply similar accounting policies and have similar critical accounting estimates in assessing those assets for impairment as we do. During 2016, our PRBIC equity method investment recorded an impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets, and we reflected a $5.8 million reduction of our equity earnings from PRBIC related to our share of that impairment. Our Stagecoach Gas equity method investment has approximately $656.5 million of goodwill in its financial statements, which it assesses for impairment annually on December 31 or whenever events indicate that it is more likely than not that its fair value could be less than its carrying amount. This assessment requires Stagecoach Gas to make certain assumptions about its further operating performance (which includes assumptions, among others, about estimating future operating margins and related future growth in those margins, contracting efforts and the cost and timing of facility expansions, in addition to current and changing economic conditions and the commodity price environment). A\nsignificant decrease in the assumptions utilized by Stagecoach Gas could result in a significant reduction in our equity earnings from Stagecoach Gas. Our investment in Stagecoach Gas was approximately $830.4 million at December 31, 2018.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership interest to determine if the entity is a variable interest entity (VIE). Our interests in a VIE are referred to as variable interests. Variable interests can be contractual, ownership or other interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the VIE's assets. When we conclude that we hold an interest in a VIE we must determine if we are the entity's primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a VIE.\nWe consolidate any VIE when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary. We must disclose the nature of any interests in a VIE that is not consolidated. Significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a VIE and in evaluating our interest in a VIE. We use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a VIE. We evaluate the entity's need for continuing financial support; the equity holder's lack of a controlling financial interest; and/or if an equity holder's voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns. We evaluate our interests in a VIE to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. We use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the VIE, either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group. We continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests, including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions. As a result of this analysis, we concluded that our investment in Crestwood Permian is a VIE that we are not the primary beneficiary of, and as a result, we account for our investment in Crestwood Permian as an equity method investment.\nOur other equity investments are not considered to be VIEs. However, any future changes in the design or nature of the activities of these entities may require us to reconsider our conclusions associated with these entities. Such reconsideration would require the identification of the variable interests in the entity and a determination of which party is the entity's primary beneficiary. If an equity investment were considered a VIE and we were determined to be the primary beneficiary, the change could cause us to consolidate the entity. The consolidation of an entity that is currently accounted for under the equity method could have a significant impact on our financial statements. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6 for more information on our equity method investments.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nWe evaluate our overall business performance based primarily on EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We do not utilize depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in our key measures because we focus our performance management on cash flow generation and our assets have long useful lives.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA - We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely accepted financial indicators of a company's operational performance and its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to our investors because it allows them to use the same performance measure analyzed internally by our management to evaluate the performance of our businesses and investments without regard to the manner in which they are financed or our capital structure. EBITDA is defined as income before income taxes, plus debt-related costs (interest and debt expense, net, and gain (loss) on modification/extinguishment of debt) and depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. Adjusted EBITDA considers the adjusted earnings impact of our unconsolidated affiliates by adjusting our equity earnings or losses from our unconsolidated affiliates to reflect our proportionate share (based on the distribution percentage) of their EBITDA, excluding impairments. Adjusted EBITDA also considers the impact of certain significant items, such as unit-based compensation charges, gains and losses on long-lived assets, impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, third party costs incurred related to potential and completed acquisitions, certain environmental remediation costs, the change in fair value of commodity inventory-related derivative contracts, costs associated with the realignment of our operations (including our Marketing, Supply and Logistics operations and other cost savings initiatives), and other transactions identified in a specific reporting period. The change in fair value of commodity inventory-related derivative contracts is considered in determining Adjusted EBITDA given that the timing of recognizing gains and losses on these derivative contracts differs from the recognition of revenue for the related underlying sale of inventory to which these derivatives relate. Changes in the fair value of other derivative contracts is not considered in determining Adjusted EBITDA given the relatively short-term nature of those derivative contracts. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, as they do not include deductions for items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, interest and income taxes, which are necessary to maintain our business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA calculations may vary among entities, so our computation may not be comparable to measures used by other companies.\nSee our reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in Results of Operations below.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations (in millions).\n\n\nSegment Results\nThe following tables summarize the EBITDA of our segments (in millions):\n\n \nSegment Results\nBelow is a discussion of the factors that impacted EBITDA by segment for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nGathering and Processing\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nEBITDA for our gathering and processing segment increased by approximately $41.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. Our gathering and processing segment's costs of product/services sold decreased by approximately $713.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, while our revenues only decreased by $683.6 million year over year.\nOur gathering and processing segment's revenues and product costs were impacted by the modified retrospective adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, during the year ended December 31, 2018, which decreased its revenues and product costs by approximately $1,015.4 million and $1,026.8 million, respectively. Also impacting our gathering and processing segment's EBITDA during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, were lower revenues and product costs of approximately $30.2 million and $21.8 million, respectively, as a result of the deconsolidation of Crestwood New Mexico Pipeline LLC (Crestwood New Mexico) in 2017.\nThe remaining increase in our gathering and processing segment's revenues and costs of product/services sold of approximately $362.0 million and $334.8 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, was primarily\ndriven by our Arrow operations. Natural gas volumes and water volumes gathered by our Arrow system increased by 40% and 30%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. These favorable variances were driven by increased producer activity and expanded capacity on our Arrow system. In addition, the Bear Den processing plant was placed into service in late 2017, which increased natural gas volumes gathered and processed by the Arrow system. Arrow also experienced higher average prices on its agreements under which it purchases and sells crude oil as a result of the increase in crude oil prices in 2018 compared to 2017.\nOur gathering and processing segment's operations and maintenance expenses increased by approximately $3.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to the increase in volumes related to our Arrow operations described above.\nOur gathering and processing segment's EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes a loss on long-lived assets of approximately $3.0 million, primarily related to the retirement and/or disposal of certain of our Arrow and Granite Wash gathering and processing assets.\nOur gathering and processing segment's EBITDA was favorably impacted by a net increase in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates of approximately $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. Equity earnings from our Jackalope equity investment increased by approximately $7.6 million primarily due to a 73% and 57% increase in its gathering and processing volumes during 2018 compared to 2017 resulting from increased producer activity on its system. Our equity earnings from our Crestwood Permian equity investment decreased by approximately $4.0 million during 2018 compared to 2017. Pursuant to the Crestwood Permian limited liability company agreement, we were allocated 100% of the equity earnings from Crestwood New Mexico through June 30, 2018. Subsequent to June 30, 2018, our equity earnings from Crestwood New Mexico were allocated based on our ownership percentage in Crestwood Permian, which is currently 50%.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nEBITDA for CEQP's gathering and processing segment increased by approximately $35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our gathering and processing segment's revenues increased by approximately $595.3 million compared to 2016, partially offset by an increase in costs of product/services sold of approximately $563.8 million during 2017 compared to 2016.\nThe increases in revenues and costs during the year ended December 31, 2017 were primarily driven by our Arrow operations, which experienced a $611.0 million increase in revenues and a $578.5 million increase in costs of product/services compared to 2016. The increase in Arrow's revenues and costs was primarily driven by higher average prices on Arrow's agreements under which it purchases and sells crude oil. In addition, crude, gas and water volumes gathered by our Arrow system increased by 30%, 10% and 27%, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, due to the connection of 97 wells on our Arrow system during 2017 compared to 48 wells during 2016.\nPartially offsetting the increase in our gathering and processing segment's revenues and costs from our Arrow operations during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, were lower revenues and costs of approximately $16.4 million and $10.6 million, respectively, from our Permian operations as a result of the deconsolidation of Crestwood New Mexico in June 2017. For a further discussion of this transaction, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6.\nOur gathering and processing segment's operations and maintenance expenses decreased by approximately $8.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, due to continued cost-reduction efforts undertaken in our operations and the deconsolidation of Crestwood New Mexico.\nOur gathering and processing segment's EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a loss on long-lived assets of approximately $14.4 million, primarily related to the retirement and/or disposition of certain of our Marcellus and Arrow gathering and processing assets.\nThe comparability of our G&P segment's EBITDA was impacted by an $8.6 million impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to our Marcellus operations. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies\u201d above and Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nOur gathering and processing segment's EBITDA was also impacted by a decrease in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates of approximately $1.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by a $10.3 million decrease in equity earnings from Jackalope resulting from a reduction in its revenues as a result of the restructuring of its contracts with Chesapeake effective January 1, 2017. Jackalope and Chesapeake replaced the cost-of-\nservice based contract with a fixed-fee gathering and processing contract that includes minimum revenue guarantees for a five to seven year period. Partially offsetting the decrease in equity earnings from Jackalope was an increase in equity earnings from our Crestwood Permian equity investment of approximately $8.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared 2016, primarily due to the contribution of Crestwood New Mexico to Crestwood Permian in June 2017, and the Nautilus system coming online in June 2017.\nStorage and Transportation\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nEBITDA for our storage and transportation segment increased by approximately $43.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The comparability of our storage and transportation segment's EBITDA year over year was impacted by a $57 million loss on contingent consideration recorded during 2017 related to our Stagecoach Gas joint venture as further described below.\nDuring 2017 and early 2018, several of COLT's firm rail loading agreements expired that provided COLT with take-or-pay revenues at rates that were higher than spot market rates. As a result, COLT's revenues decreased by approximately $16.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 despite its rail loading volumes increasing by 28% year-over-year. The increase in volumes was due to higher demand for rail loading services resulting from higher Bakken crude oil production and higher basis differentials between Bakken and the U.S. western and eastern markets.\nOur storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was also impacted by a net increase in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. Earnings from our Stagecoach Gas equity investment increased by approximately $4.0 million during 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to our share of Stagecoach Gas' equity earnings increasing from 35% to 40% effective July 1, 2018. Effective July 1, 2019, our equity earnings from Stagecoach Gas will be allocated based on our ownership percentage, which is currently 50%. Partially offsetting this increase were lower equity earnings from our Tres Holdings equity investment of approximately $2.2 million due to higher repair and maintenance costs at the joint venture.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nEBITDA for CEQP's storage and transportation segment decreased by approximately $65.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our storage and transportation segment's revenues were lower due to a reduction in revenues of approximately $51.1 million from our COLT Hub operations compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in our rail throughput revenues from the expiration of two rail loading contracts in late 2016, a 58% decrease in rail loading volumes and lower margins resulting from higher average crude oil prices in the Bakken compared to other basins, which has decreased the demand and rates for our rail loading services in 2017 compared to 2016. Also impacting our storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was $44.9 million of goodwill impairments recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to our COLT Hub operations. For a further discussion of these impairments, see Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies\u201d above and Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nThe comparability of our storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was also impacted by a $57 million loss on contingent consideration recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to our Stagecoach Gas joint venture. Pursuant to the Stagecoach Gas limited liability company agreement, we may be required to make payments of up to $57 million to CEGP after December 31, 2020 if certain criteria are not met by Stagecoach Gas by December 31, 2020, including achieving certain performance targets on growth capital projects. These growth capital projects depend on the construction of other third-party expansion projects, and during 2017, those third-party projects experienced regulatory and other delays that caused Stagecoach Gas to delay its growth capital projects. Although Stagecoach Gas anticipates that these growth capital projects will be constructed in the future, it does not expect that these projects will produce meaningful operating results prior to December 31, 2020.\nOur storage and transportation segment's results was impacted by a $32.4 million loss recognized on the deconsolidation of our Northeast storage and transportation assets as a result of the contribution of these assets to the Stagecoach Gas joint venture in June 2016. The deconsolidation of the Northeast storage and transportation assets resulted in lower revenues and costs of product/services sold of approximately $74.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 6 for a further discussion of the deconsolidation of our NE S&T assets.\nWe experienced lower operations and maintenance expenses of approximately $17.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily as a result of the deconsolidation of the Northeast storage and transportation assets. In addition, in June 2016, the Matagorda County court issued a final judgment related to Tres Palacios' 2012 and 2013 property tax years which resulted in CEQP recording additional net property taxes (including interest and penalties) of approximately $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur storage and transportation segment's EBITDA was impacted by an increase in earnings from our unconsolidated affiliates. As discussed above, in June 2016, we deconsolidated our Northeast storage and transportation assets as a result of the Stagecoach Gas transaction and began accounting for our 50% equity interest in Stagecoach Gas under the equity method of accounting. We recognized equity earnings from Stagecoach Gas of approximately $25.3 million and $15.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Earnings from our Tres Holdings equity investment increased by approximately $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to property tax accruals recorded by Tres Holdings during 2016.\nMarketing, Supply and Logistics\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nEBITDA for our marketing, supply and logistics segment increased by approximately $76.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The comparability of our marketing, supply and logistics segment's results was impacted by the sale of certain of our assets during 2018 and 2017 and approximately $121.0 million of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairments recorded during 2017, all of which are further described below.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $26.9 million loss on long-lived assets related to the sale of our West Coast facilities in October 2018, which also resulted in lower revenues and costs of product/services sold of approximately $81.4 million and $71.4 million in 2018 compared to 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $33.6 million gain related to the sale of US Salt, which also resulted in lower revenues and costs of product/services sold of approximately $59.8 million and $34.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017.\nEBITDA for our marketing, supply and logistics segment (excluding the impacts from the sale of our West Coast and US Salt assets described above) was also impacted by an increase in its revenues and costs of product/services sold of approximately $614.3 million and $574.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017.\nOur crude and natural gas marketing operations experienced an increase in its revenues and product costs of approximately $564.5 million and $557.6 million. These increases were driven by higher crude marketing volumes due to increased marketing activity surrounding our crude-related operations.\nThe remaining $32.6 million increase in our revenues (net of costs of product/services sold) during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 was driven by our NGL marketing and logistics operations. Included in our costs of product/services sold was a gain of $29.6 million and a loss of $31.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Of the $29.6 million gain in 2018, approximately $18.3 million related to the change in fair value of commodity inventory-related derivative contracts that had not yet settled in cash at December 31, 2018. The remaining increase in our revenues and costs of product/services sold of our NGL marketing and logistics operations was primarily the result of our ability to capture more marketing opportunities to purchase and sell NGLs given the unusually cold weather during 2018. In addition, we experienced increased demand for trucking, rail, storage and terminal services as a result of an expanded US NGL supply base and market dislocations caused by increased NGL supplies from various high growth regions and regional pipeline outages.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our marketing, supply and logistics segment's operations and maintenance expenses decreased by approximately $12.6 million compared to 2017, primarily due to the sale of our West Coast and US Salt assets described above, in addition to efforts to realign certain of its operations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nEBITDA for our marketing, supply and logistics segment increased by approximately $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The comparability of our marketing, supply and logistics segment's results was significantly impacted by goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairments of $121.0 million recorded during 2017 and goodwill and intangible asset impairments of $140.5 million recorded during 2016. For a further\ndiscussion of our impairments recorded during 2017 and 2016, see Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies\u201d above and Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 2.\nOur supply and logistics operations experienced an increase in revenues and costs of product/services sold of $465.0 million and $457.9 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. During 2016, we experienced unseasonably warm weather which resulted in lower demand for NGLs compared to increased demand experienced during 2017. The costs of product/services sold increase includes a loss of $31.2 million and $7.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to our commodity-based derivative contracts. These changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts resulted from higher average NGL prices during 2017 compared to 2016, which resulted in an increase in our liabilities from price risk management activities associated with contracts that provide fixed prices on future sales of our NGL inventory.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, our storage and terminals operations (including our West Coast operations) experienced a $173.6 million and $174.4 million increase in revenues and costs of product/services sold, respectively, compared to 2016. These increases were primarily driven by increases in NGL prices during the year ended December 31, 2017. Although our net operating results were relatively consistent during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, we experienced NGL market headwinds in the Northeast during 2017, with NGL exports and other market dynamics causing price differentials to narrow between purchasing NGLs in the summer (which are then stored in our NGL facilities) and selling NGLs in the winter. These dynamics also caused the rates that we are able to charge for storing NGLs in our facilities to decline from their historical levels. Also during 2017, our West Coast customers also experienced headwinds, with both producers and refineries located in the Western U.S. experiencing regulatory challenges and an inflow of NGLs from the Eastern U.S. This caused demand for the gathering, processing and logistics services from our West Coast operations to remain relatively flat in 2017 compared to 2016. Considering the fact that the net operating results of our storage and terminals operations (including West Coast) have been relatively consistent over the past several years, we do not anticipate that these operations will grow as fast or to the degree that we expected when we merged with Inergy, LP in 2013 given current market dynamics, which we believe will continue for the foreseeable future.\nRevenues and costs of product/services sold from our crude and natural gas marketing operations increased by approximately $261.9 million and $260.5 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. These increases were primarily driven by higher crude marketing volumes due to increased marketing activity surrounding our Bakken crude-related operations resulting from higher Bakken crude oil production and higher basis differentials between Bakken and the U.S. western and eastern markets.\nOur NGL and crude trucking operations continued to experience lower operating results in 2017 compared to 2016, with a $12.4 million and $5.7 million decrease in revenues and costs of product/services sold during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. This decrease was primarily a result of the realignment of our trucking operations in 2017 to reduce the size of our trucking fleet in response to the continued decline in demand for trucking services due to the continued lower commodity price environment.\nOur marketing, supply and logistic segment's operations and maintenance expenses increased by approximately $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. In 2016, we received a $3.1 million property tax refund related to our West Coast operations.\nIn December 2017, we sold 100% of our equity interests in US Salt to an affiliate of Kissner Group Holdings LP for net proceeds of approximately $223.6 million, and we recognized a gain of approximately $33.6 million from the sale. For a further discussion of this sale, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 3.\nOther EBITDA Results\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our general and administrative costs decreased compared to 2017, while we experienced an increase in these costs during 2017 compared to 2016. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred approximately $1.3 million and $2.2 million of transactional and other general and administrative costs related primarily to the realignment initiatives we undertook related to realigning our Marketing, Supply and Logistics operations. In addition, our unit-based compensation charges increased by $3.0 million from 2017 to 2018 and by $6.3 million from 2016 to 2017 due to higher average awards outstanding under our long-term incentive plans.\nItems not affecting EBITDA include the following:\nDepreciation, Amortization and Accretion Expense. During the year ended December 31, 2018, our depreciation, amortization and accretion expense decreased compared to 2017 and 2016, primarily due to the sale of our West Coast assets and US Salt operations during 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the deconsolidation of our Crestwood New Mexico operations in 2017. For a further discussion of these transactions, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Notes 3 and 6.\nInterest and Debt Expense, Net. During the year ended December 31, 2018, interest and debt expense, net was relatively flat compared to 2017, while we experienced a decrease of approximately $25.7 million during 2017 compared to 2016. The net decrease was primarily due to repayments of amounts previously outstanding under Crestwood Midstream's senior notes in 2017 and late 2016 .\nThe following table provides a summary of our interest and debt expense, net (in millions).\n\nGain (Loss) on Modification/Extinguishment of Debt. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized a loss on modification of debt of approximately $0.9 million in conjunction with amending and restating Crestwood Midstream's senior secured revolving credit facility. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $37.7 million in conjunction with the tender of the principal amounts previously outstanding under Crestwood Midstream's senior notes due in 2020 and 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $10.0 million in conjunction with the early tender of a portion of the principal amounts previously outstanding under Crestwood Midstream's senior notes due in 2020 and 2022.\nLiquidity and Sources of Capital\nCrestwood Equity is a holding company that derives all of its operating cash flow from its operating subsidiaries. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated by operating activities from our subsidiaries, distributions from our joint ventures, borrowings under the CMLP credit facility, and sales of equity and debt securities. Our equity investments use cash from their respective operations to fund their operating activities, maintenance and growth capital expenditures, and service their outstanding indebtedness. We believe our liquidity sources and operating cash flows are sufficient to address our future operating, debt service and capital requirements.\nWe make cash quarterly distributions to our common unitholders within approximately 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter in an aggregate amount equal to our available cash for such quarter. We also pay cash quarterly distributions of approximately $15 million to our preferred unitholders. We believe our operating cash flows will well exceed cash distributions to our partners and our preferred unitholders at current levels, and as a result, we will have substantial operating cash flows as a source of liquidity for our growth capital expenditures.\nIn October 2018, Crestwood Midstream entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Second Amended Credit Agreement). The Second Amended Credit Agreement provides for a five-year $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in October 2023 and is available to fund acquisitions, working capital and internal growth projects and for general partnership purposes. Interest rates under the Second Amended Credit Agreement were reduced by 0.25%, and the debt covenants under the Second Amended Credit Agreement are materially consistent with those under the previous credit facility. For a further discussion of the Second Amended Credit Agreement, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 9. As of December 31, 2018, we had $524.0 million of available capacity under the credit facility considering the most restrictive debt covenants in the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants applicable to the credit facility and our senior notes. See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 9 for a more detailed description of the credit facility and senior notes.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides a summary of Crestwood Equity's cash flows by category (in millions):\n\nOperating Activities\nOur operating cash flows decreased by $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. We experienced higher revenues and costs primarily from our gathering and processing segment's Arrow operations of $362.0 million and $334.8 million, respectively, and higher revenues (net of costs of product/services sold) from our marketing, supply and logistics segment's NGL marketing and logistics operations of approximately $32.6 million . Offsetting these higher revenues and costs was a $16.3 million decrease in operating revenues from our COLT Hub operations and a net cash outflow from working capital requirements of approximately $47.2 million. For a further discussion of our segments' results, see Results of Operations above.\nOur operating cash flows decreased approximately $90.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a $125.6 million decrease in our storage and transportation segment's revenues primarily resulting from the deconsolidation of our Northeast storage and transportation assets and a reduction in rail throughput revenues from our COLT operations. This was partially offset by a $1,488.5 million increase in revenues from our gathering and processing and marketing, supply and logistics operations discussed above, offset by a $1,449.6 million increase in costs of product/services sold primarily related to these segments' operations.\nInvesting Activities\nCapital Expenditures. The energy midstream business is capital intensive, requiring significant investments for the acquisition or development of new facilities. We categorize our capital expenditures as either:\n \u2022 growth capital expenditures, which are made to construct additional assets, expand and upgrade existing systems, or acquire additional assets; or \n \u2022 maintenance capital expenditures, which are made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets, extend their useful lives or comply with regulatory requirements. \nDuring 2019, we anticipate growth capital expenditures of approximately $275 million to $325 million, which includes contributions to our equity investments related to their capital projects. In addition, we expect to spend between approximately $20 million to $25 million on maintenance capital expenditures and approximately $25 million to $30 million on capital expenditures that are directly reimbursable by our customers. We anticipate that our growth and reimbursable capital expenditures in 2019 will increase the services we can provide to our customers and the operating efficiencies of our systems. We expect to finance our capital expenditures with a combination of cash generated by our operating subsidiaries, distributions received from our equity investments and borrowings under our credit facility.\nWe have identified additional growth capital project opportunities for each of our reporting segments. Additional commitments or expenditures will be made at our discretion, and any discontinuation of the construction of these projects will likely result in less future cash flows and earnings. The following table summarizes our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in millions):\n\n (1) Represents purchases of property, plant and equipment that are reimbursable by third parties. \nIn addition to the capital expenditures described in the table above, our cash flows from investing activities were also impacted by the following significant items during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n \u2022 In October 2018, we sold our West Coast facilities to a third party for net proceeds of approximately $70.5 million; \n \u2022 In December 2017, we sold 100% of our equity interests in US Salt to an affiliate of Kissner Group Holdings LP for net proceeds of approximately $223.6 million; \n \u2022 In June 2016, we contributed to Stagecoach Gas the entities owning the NE S&T assets, CEGP contributed $975 million in exchange for a 50% equity interest in Stagecoach Gas, and Stagecoach Gas distributed to us the net cash proceeds received from CEGP; and \n \u2022 During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we contributed approximately $64.4 million, $58.0 million and $12.4 million, respectively, to our equity investments to fund their expansion projects and their operating activities. \nFinancing Activities\nSignificant items impacting our financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 included the following:\nEquity Transactions\n \u2022 In December 2017, Crestwood Niobrara redeemed 100% of the outstanding Series A preferred units issued to a subsidiary of General Electric Capital Corporation and GE Structured Finance, Inc. (collectively, GE) for an aggregate purchase price of $202.7 million and issued $175 million of new Series A-2 preferred units to CN Jackalope Holdings LLC (Jackalope Holdings). For a further discussion of this transaction, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 12. We began making distributions to Jackalope Holdings on its Series A-2 preferred units in April 2018, and during the year ended December 31, 2018, we distributed approximately $9.9 million to our non-controlling partner. During each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we distributed approximately $15.2 million to GE for its non-controlling interest in Crestwood Niobrara; \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, our distributions to partners increased by approximately $3.2 million compared to 2017 due to an increase our common unitholders. Our distributions to partners decreased by approximately $52.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a reduction in distributions paid per limited partner unit from $1.375 to $0.60 beginning with the distribution paid in May 2016; \n \u2022 During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we made cash distributions of approximately $60.1 million and $15 million to our preferred unitholders. Prior to September 30, 2017, we paid quarterly distributions to our preferred unitholders by issuing additional preferred units; \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received net proceeds of approximately $15.2 million from the issuance of CEQP common units; and \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, our taxes paid for unit-based compensation vesting increased by approximately $1.9 million compared to 2017, and increased by approximately $4.7 million during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to higher vesting of unit-based compensation awards. \nDebt Transactions\n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2018, our debt-related transactions resulted in net borrowings of approximately $253.4 million compared to net repayments of approximately $76.3 million in 2017 and net repayments of $974.5 million in 2016. During 2017 and 2016, we redeemed all amounts previously outstanding under Crestwood Midstream's senior notes due in 2020 and 2022. During 2017, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2025. For a further discussion of these and other debt-related transactions, see Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 9. \nContractual Obligations\nWe are party to various contractual obligations. A portion of these obligations are reflected in our financial statements, such as long-term debt and other accrued liabilities, while other obligations, such as operating leases, capital commitments and contractual interest amounts are not reflected on our balance sheet. The following table and discussion summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in millions):\n\n (1) $578.2 million of our long-term debt is variable interest rate debt at the Alternate Base rate or Eurodollar rate plus an applicable spread. These rates plus their applicable spreads were between 4.63% and 6.75% at December 31, 2018. These rates have been applied for each period presented in the table. \n (2) See Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules, Note 15 for a further discussion of these obligations. \n (3) Fixed price purchase commitments are volumetrically offset by third party fixed price sale contracts. \n (4) Primarily related to growth and maintenance contractual purchase obligations in our gathering and processing segment and environmental obligations included in other current liabilities on our balance sheet. Other contractual purchase obligations are defined as legally enforceable agreements to purchase goods or services that have fixed or minimum quantities and fixed or minimum variable price provisions, and that detail approximate timing of the underlying obligations. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.\nOur equity interest in Crestwood Permian is considered to be a variable interest entity. We are not the primary beneficiary of Crestwood Permian and as a result, we account for our investment in Crestwood Permian as an equity method investment. For a further discussion of our investment in Crestwood Permian, see Part IV, Item 15.

Here is a condensed summary for easier consumption:\n\n**Financial Overview:**\nThe report includes both historical data and forward-looking statements, which involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that could cause actual financial outcomes to differ. Factors that could impact performance include but are not limited to the company's ability to implement its business plan, governmental regulations, industry fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas, weather conditions, economic conditions, and the availability of financing.\n\n**Company Profile:**\nThe company is a fully-integrated midstream service provider based in Houston, Texas, with operations conducted through the wholly-owned subsidiary, Crestwood Midstream. Services include connecting shale-based energy supplies to demand markets and are provided in significant supply basins across the United States.\n\n**Financial Performance and Strategy:**\nThe company aims to create long-term value for its unitholders. The strategy includes generating stable margins and cash flows, prudent financing of investments, and controlling operating costs. Performance measures revolve around EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization), which are non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Operational Segments:**\nOperations are divided into three key segments: Gathering and Processing (G&P), Storage and Transportation (S&T), and Marketing, Supply, and Logistics (MS&L).
