Currencies are abbreviated as follows: the U.S. Dollar (USD or $), the Great Britain Pound (GBP or \u00a3), the Euro (EUR or \u20ac), the Australian Dollar (AUD or A$) and the Canadian Dollar (CAD or C$).\nThe following comments should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements.\nOverview.\nIn the final calendar quarter (4Q) of 2019, Utah Medical Products, Inc. (Nasdaq: UTMD) began to realize accretive profits net of the quarterly amortization of the purchase price paid to CooperSurgical Inc. (CSI) for the acquisition of exclusive Filshie Clip System distribution rights in the U.S. The 4Q results allowed UTMD to meet its beginning of 2019 year projections to stockholders for the year as a whole.\nIncome statement results in 2019 compared to 2018 were as follows:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,904\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,998\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> +11.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Profit (GP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 29,466\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 26,306\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> +12.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17,633\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,697\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5.7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Before Tax (EBT)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17,884\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,458\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (8.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income before TCJA tax adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,145\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,504\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (8.8\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income per US GAAP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,727\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,555\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (20.6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EPS before TCJA tax adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.784\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.136\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (8.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings per Share (EPS) per US GAAP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.939\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.950\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (20.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2019 sales increase was the result of 30% higher U.S. domestic sales, led by a $3,501 increase in domestic sales of the Filshie Clip System and $2,222 higher U.S. pressure transducer kit sales to an OEM customer. Sales outside the U.S. (OUS) were 7% lower, about half of which ($631) was the result of a lower foreign currency exchange (FX) rate when converting foreign currency sales to USD. Operating Income and EBT were lower due to a new $4,053 noncash expense in 2019 resulting from amortizing the $21,000 purchase price of acquiring the remaining life of the U.S. exclusive distribution rights for the Filshie Clip System in February 2019.\nNet Income and EPS per U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) in both 2019 and 2018 were affected by a change in UTMD's estimate of the IRC 965 Transition (REPAT) Tax initially booked in 2017 resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (TCJA) enacted by Congress in December 2017, and the concomitant ensuing Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) tax and Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) tax credit which liability began in 2018. US GAAP Net Sales, GP, Operating Income and EBT were not affected by the TCJA tax estimate-related adjustments in 2019 or 2018. The adjustments to UTMD's income tax estimates are more fully explained later in this report. Because of the TCJA-related tax estimate adjustments, in UTMD management's view, a comparison of US GAAP Net Income and EPS between 2019 and 2018 does not provide stockholders with meaningful insight about UTMD's financial performance. The non-GAAP results presented above eliminate the TCJA-related tax estimate adjustments from Net Income and EPS.\nThe associated key 2019 profit margins (profits as a percentage of sales) compared to the 2018 calendar year follow:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Profit Margin (GPM)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 62.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 62.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income Margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 37.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 44.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Before Tax Margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 38.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 46.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income Margin before TCJA tax adjusts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 30.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 36.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income Margin per US GAAP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 31.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 44.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMeasures of the Company's liquidity and overall financial condition improved as of the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018 as the result of continued strong positive cash flow from normal operations. The Company's continued excellent positive cash flow in 2019 allowed it to increase cash dividends paid to stockholders, repurchase 5,000 UTMD shares in the open market, use $23,048 to repurchase Filshie Clip System exclusive distribution rights and inventory from CSI and use $540 in cash for maintaining Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) in good working order.\nIn spite of the above uses of $28,097 in cash, UTMD's cash equivalent balances at the end of 2019 declined just $8,325 to $42,787 compared to $51,112 at the end of 2018. Working capital declined just $4,206 to $51,438 at the end of 2019 from $55,643 at the end of 2018. Total liabilities decreased $2,082. The Company remained without debt. UTMD's total debt ratio (total liabilities to total assets) was 8% at the end of 2019 compared to 11% at the end of 2018. Stockholders' Equity increased to $101,092 from $88,992 at the end of 2018, despite the 2019 payments of $4,112 in cash dividends to stockholders and use of $398 for share repurchases, both of which reduce Stockholders' Equity.\nProductivity of Fixed Assets and Working Capital Assets.\nAssets.\nYear-end 2019 total consolidated assets were $109,787 comprised of $54,885 in current assets, $10,728 in consolidated net PP&E and $44,173 in net intangible assets. This compares to $99,768 total assets at the end of 2018 comprised of $60,903 in current assets, $10,359 in consolidated net PP&E and $28,506 in net intangible assets. Total asset turns (total consolidated sales divided by average total assets for the year) in 2019 were 45%, compared to 44% in 2018, as the growth in sales outpaced the growth in average assets.\nCurrent assets decreased $6,018 due to a $8,325 decrease in year-end cash and investments, a $786 increase in accounts and other receivables and a $1,501 increase in year-end inventories. Year-end 2019 and 2018 cash and investment balances were $42,787 and $51,112, representing 39% and 51% of total assets, respectively. Net (after allowance for doubtful accounts) year-end trade accounts receivable (A/R) balances increased $756. This was due to the 30% higher domestic sales. Average days in A/R from date of invoice on December 31, 2019 and at December 31, 2018 were both 36 days based on 4Q 2019 and 4Q 2018 shipments respectively. The Company believes any older A/R will be collected or are within its reserve balances for uncollectible amounts. Average 2019 consolidated inventory turns were 2.8 compared to 2.9 in 2018 based on the applicable year's cost of goods sold. The increase in inventories was primarily the result of beginning to directly sell the Filshie Clip System to U.S. medical facilities in 2019.\nWorking capital (current assets minus current liabilities) at year-end 2019 was 8% lower at $51,438 compared to $55,643 at year-end 2018. Consistent with Federal and State rules, the REPAT tax current liability was only $101 at the end of 2019. The end of 2019 working capital significantly exceeds UTMD's needs for normal operations, funding future organic growth and timely payment of accrued tax liabilities, in addition to allowing for substantial funding of any future acquisition without diluting stockholder interest.\nDecember 31, 2019 net $10.7 million total PP&E includes Utah, Ireland and England manufacturing molds, production tooling and equipment, test equipment, and product development laboratory equipment. In addition, PP&E includes computers and software, warehouse equipment, furniture and fixtures, facilities and real estate for all five locations in Utah, Ireland, UK, Canada and Australia. Manufacturing facilities in Utah, Ireland and the UK are standalone buildings with a combined 220,000 square feet on 15 acres of land. The distribution facilities in Australia and Canada with a combined 8,000 square feet are part of larger industrial condominiums. Management estimates the fair market value of the five owned facilities to be at least $21 million excluding the contents, the fungible value of which increases stockholder enterprise value relative to most of UTMD's industry peers which lease their facilities.\nEnding 2019 net consolidated PP&E (depreciated book value of all fixed assets) increased $369 as a result of the combination of capital expenditures of $540, depreciation of $700 and the effect of FX rates on year-end foreign subsidiary asset balances.\nThe following end-of-year FX rates in USD applied to assets and liabilities of each applicable foreign subsidiary:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n12-31-19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12-31-18\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EUR\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.1227\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.1456\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GBP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.3268\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.2760\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AUD\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.7030\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.7046\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CAD\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.7715\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.7329\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe year-end 2019 net book value (after accumulated depreciation) of consolidated PP&E was 32% of purchase cost. End-of-year PP&E turns (Net Sales divided by Net PP&E) was 4.4 in 2019 compared to 4.1 in 2018 due primarily to the 12% higher 2019 sales. A future leverage in productivity of fixed assets which will not have to be increased to support new business activity will be a source of incremental profitability.\nNet intangible assets (after accumulated amortization) are comprised of the capitalized costs of obtaining patents and other intellectual property, as well as the value of identifiable intangible assets (IIA) and goodwill resulting from acquisitions. Net intangible assets were $44,173 (40% of total assets) at the end of 2019 compared to $28,506 (29% of total assets) at the end of 2018. Per US GAAP, intangible assets are categorized as either 1) IIA, which are amortized over the estimated useful life of the assets, or 2) goodwill, which is not amortized or expensed until the associated economic value of the acquired asset becomes impaired. The two categories of Femcare intangibles at year-end 2019 were net IIA of $13,202 and goodwill of $6,770. The accumulated amortization of Femcare IIA as of December 31, 2019 since the March 18, 2011 acquisition was $18,750. The remaining Femcare IIA will be fully amortized in 6 more years. The goodwill portion of intangible assets resulting from the Femcare acquisition, which is not amortized, increased $259 due to a stronger GBP at year-end. The GBP FX rate at December 31, 2019 increased 4.0% from December 31, 2018. In 2019, UTMD acquired an additional $21,000 IIA from the purchase of the remaining life of exclusive U.S. distribution rights for the Filshie Clip System from CSI, of which $4,053 was amortized during the year. The remaining CSI IIA will be fully amortized in 4 more years. UTMD's goodwill balance including the Femcare goodwill was $13,961 at the end of 2019, 32% of total net intangibles.\nBecause the products associated with UTMD's acquisitions of Columbia Medical in 1997, Gesco in 1998, Abcorp in 2004 and Femcare in 2011 continue to be viable parts of UTMD's overall business, UTMD does not expect the current goodwill value associated with the four acquisitions to become impaired in 2020. Amortization of IIA was $6,144 in 2019 compared to $2,191 in 2018. The difference was essentially the amortization of $21,000 new IIA resulting from the acquisition of CSI remaining Filshie Clip System exclusive U.S. distribution rights in 2019. The 2019 non-cash amortization expense of Femcare IIA was $2,037 (\u00a31,595) compared to $2,130 (\u00a31,595) in 2018. The Femcare IIA amortization USD difference was again due to the change in USD/GBP FX rate. The 2020 non-cash amortization expense (included as part of operating expenses) of Femcare IIA will again be \u00a31,595, or $2,074 if the USD/GBP average FX rate is 1.30. The 2019 non-cash amortization expense of CSI IIA was $4,053 compared to zero in 2018. The 2020 operating expense resulting from amortization of CSI IIA will be $4,421.\nLiabilities.\nThe remaining $2,212 balance of the corrected $2,792 total REPAT tax liability from the TCJA is 79% instead of 84% (after the allowed 16% in the first two years of eight years' pay out), because the initial Federal and State payments were based on an initial estimate which was conservatively too high at $6,288 compared to the current adjusted estimate of $2,792. The Federal and State REPAT tax payment requirement is 8% of the respective REPAT tax liability per year for the first five years, 15% in the sixth year, 20% in the seventh year and 25% in the eighth year.\nYear-end 2019 current liabilities were $1,812 lower than at the end of 2018. Ending accrued liabilities were $1,952 lower due to lower taxes payable and lower customer deposits. Total liabilities were $2,082 lower at the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018. The resulting 2019 year-end total debt ratio was 8% compared to 11% at the end of 2018.\nThe year-end 2019 DTL balance created as a result of the fifteen year deferred tax consequence of the amortization of Femcare's IIA was $2,239, down from $2,541 at the end of 2018. The relatively small decline in this DTL considering the $2,037 in 2019 amortization of IIA (suggesting a 15% tax rate) was due to a 4% stronger GBP compared to the USD at the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018. In addition to liabilities stated on the balance sheet, UTMD has operating lease and purchase obligations described in Note 8 to the financial statements.\nResults of Operations.\na) Revenues.\nUnder accounting standards applicable for 2019, the Company believed that revenue should be recognized at the time of shipment as title generally passes to the customer at the time of shipment, or completion of services performed under contract. Revenue recognized by UTMD is based upon documented arrangements and fixed contracts in which the selling price is fixed prior to acceptance and completion of an order. Revenue from product or service sales is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped or service completed and invoiced, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Over 99% of UTMD's revenue is recognized at the time UTMD ships a physical device to a customer's designated location, where the selling price for the item shipped was agreed prior to UTMD's acceptance and completion of the customer order. There are no post-shipment obligations which have been or are expected to be material to financial results.\nThere are circumstances under which revenue may be recognized when product is not shipped, which have met the criteria of ASC 606: the Company provides engineering services, for example, design and production of manufacturing tooling that may be used in subsequent UTMD manufacturing of custom components for other companies. This revenue is recognized when UTMD's service has been completed according to a fixed contractual agreement.\nBeginning on January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, a new revenue recognition accounting standard. Management completed an extensive assessment and implementation of the standard, including UTMD's various contracts with customers and associated performance obligations and the Company's conclusions regarding its revenue recognition practices and procedures. Other items like commissions and rights of return were also evaluated by the Company. Management is confident that the Company has properly evaluated the standard's requirements and has arrived at appropriate conclusions in recognizing revenue in accordance with the new standard. Those practices and procedures the Company will use to recognize revenue under the new standard are not significantly different than the methods used previously since UTMD has traditionally recognized revenue upon shipping a physical device to a customer's designated location, which is also when the Company has met its performance obligations under contracts it has with its customers that represent over 99% of its revenue. While the Company's revenue not associated with shipping a physical product is immaterial, management believes the Company's practices in recognizing that revenue is also in accordance with ASU 2014-09.\nTerms of sale are established in advance of UTMD's acceptance of customer orders. In the U.S., Ireland, UK, France, Australia and Canada since the beginning of 2017, UTMD has generally accepted orders directly from and shipped directly to end-user clinical facilities, as well as third party medical/surgical distributors, under UTMD's Standard Terms and Conditions (T&C) of Sale. About 9% of UTMD's domestic end-user sales went through third party med/surg distributors which contract separately with clinical facilities to provide purchasing, storage and scheduled delivery functions for the applicable facility. UTMD's T&C of Sale to end-user facilities are substantially the same in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, UK, France and Australia.\nUTMD may have separate discounted pricing agreements with a specific clinical facility or group of affiliated facilities based on volume of purchases. Pricing agreements which are documented arrangements with clinical facilities, or groups of affiliated facilities, if applicable, are established in advance of orders accepted or shipments made. For existing customers, past actual shipment volumes typically determine the fixed price by part number for the next agreement period of one year. For new customers, the customer's best estimate of volume is usually accepted by UTMD for determining the ensuing fixed prices for the agreement period. Prices are not adjusted after an order is accepted. For the sake of clarity, the separate pricing agreements with clinical facilities based on volume of purchases disclosure is not inconsistent with UTMD's disclosure above that the selling price is fixed prior to the acceptance of a specific customer order.\nUTMD's global consolidated trade sales are comprised of domestic and OUS sales. Domestic sales in 2019 included 1) direct domestic sales, sales of finished devices to end-user facilities and med/surg distributors in the U.S., and 2) domestic OEM sales, sales of components or finished products, which may not be medical devices, to other companies for inclusion in their products. In 2018, domestic sales included the above two items (except that direct domestic sales did not include the Filshie Clip System) plus sales of the Filshie Clip System by Femcare UK to CSI. OUS sales are export sales from UTMD in the U.S. to customers outside the U.S. invoiced in USD, and all sales from UTMD subsidiaries in Ireland, Canada, Australia and the UK (other than Femcare UK sales to CSI in 2018) which may be invoiced in EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD or USD. The term trade\u201d means sales to customers which are not part of UTMD. Each UTMD entity had 2019 intercompany sales of components and/or finished devices to other UTMD entities.\nGlobal consolidated trade sales in 2019 were $46,904 compared to $41,998 in 2018 and $41,414 in 2017. The $4,906 (+11.7%) higher sales in 2019 were the result of several offsetting factors described below. Total U.S. domestic sales were up $6,302 (+29.7%) in 2019, at $27,493 compared to $21,192 in 2018. OUS sales were down $1,395 (6.7%) at $19,411 compared to $20,806 in 2018.\nDomestic Sales.\nU.S. domestic sales in 2019 were $27,493 (59% of total sales) compared to $21,192 (50% of total sales) in 2018. The contributors to the 2019 total $6,302 (+29.7%) higher domestic sales were $3,501 (+106%) higher sales of Filshie Clip System devices in the U.S., $2,452 (+60%) higher sales of components and finished devices used in other companies' products (OEM customers), and $349 (+3%) higher direct sales of non-Filshie finished devices to domestic end-users. Domestic sales in 2017 were $20,286.\nDomestic Filshie Clip System sales in 2019 were 25% of total U.S. domestic sales compared to 16% in 2018. The higher domestic Filshie Clip System sales occurred as a result of converting from Femcare UK sales to a domestic distributor in 2018 to UTMD sales directly to end-users in 2019.\nDomestic OEM sales in 2019 were 24% of total U.S. domestic sales compared to 19% in 2018. UTMD sold components and finished devices to 147 different U.S. companies in 2019 compared to 152 companies in 2018 for use in their product offerings. Sales to UTMD's largest OEM customer, representing 75% of total domestic OEM sales, were up $2,222 (+82%). Although this customer has projected higher purchases from UTMD in 2020, UTMD is expecting lower 2020 sales due to recognizing the customer's inventory build-up.\nDomestic direct (end-user) sales excluding the Filshie Clip System were 51% of total U.S. domestic sales in 2019 compared to 65% in 2018. Of UTMD's three main domestic direct categories, neonatal products were $4,654 (+2% higher), labor & delivery (L&D) products were $4,053 (+8% higher), and gynecology/ electrosurgery/ urology products excluding the Filshie Clip System were $4,826 (about the same).\nOUS Sales.\nSales OUS in 2019 were $19,411 (6.7% lower) compared to $20,806 in 2018. OUS sales were $21,129 in 2017.\nBecause a significant portion of UTMD's sales are invoiced in foreign currencies, changes in FX rates can potentially have a material effect on period-to-period USD-denominated sales. UTMD's FX rates for income statement purposes are transaction-weighted averages. The average rates from the applicable foreign currency to USD during 2019 compared to 2018 follow:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GBP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.277\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.334\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EUR\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.119\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.180\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AUD\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.696\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.747\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CAD\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.754\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.773\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales weighted-average change:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nForty-five percent ($631) of the $1,395 lower OUS sales were due to the changes in FX rates (stronger USD in 2019). EUR currency sales in 2019 were reduced $277 compared to what the same EUR sales in 2018 would have been expressed in USD. GBP currency sales in 2019 were reduced $174 compared to what the same GBP sales in 2018 would have been expressed in USD. AUD currency sales in 2019 were reduced $126 compared to what the same AUD sales in 2018 would have been expressed in USD. CAD currency sales in 2019 were reduced $54 compared to what the same CAD sales in 2018 would have been expressed in USD.\nSixty-six percent of (USD denominated) 2019 OUS sales were invoiced in foreign currencies compared to 67% in 2018. As a portion of total USD consolidated sales, 27% of UTMD's USD-equivalent sales were invoiced in foreign currencies in 2019 compared to 33% in 2018. The GBP, EUR, AUD and CAD converted sales represented 8%, 11%, 4% and 4% of total 2019 USD sales, respectively. This compares to 10% GBP, 12% EUR, 5% AUD and 6% CAD of total 2018 USD sales. The lower converted foreign currency sales percentages of total sales in 2019 were not only due to the stronger USD, but also much higher domestic sales.\nVariations in order pattern of UTMD's China distributors, one for BPM devices and another for neonatal devices, continue to be significant from year-to-year. The China BPM distributor purchased $662 more and the China neonatal device distributor $519 less in 2019 compared to 2018, largely offsetting one another. UTMD expects that the reverse might be the case in 2020.\nUSD-denominated trade (excludes intercompany) sales of devices to OUS customers by UTMD's Ireland facility (UTMD Ltd) were $5,894 (+18%) in 2019 compared to $5,008 in 2018. As the EUR was down 5.1% relative to the USD in 2019, the FX impact subtracted $277 from 2019 sales. In other words, constant currency sales were $6,171 (+23%). UTMD Ltd produces the BPM devices sold to UTMD's China distributor. In constant EUR currency and eliminating sales of BPM devices to its China distributor in both years 2019 and 2018, 2019 Ireland trade sales experienced 13% growth compared to 2018.\nIn 2019, UTMD's UK subsidiary, Femcare Ltd., had $5,382 trade sales of devices to domestic UK, domestic France and international distributor customers, down 8% compared to $5,849 in 2018. The FX impact subtracted $174 (4.3%) from 2019 sales, explaining about half of the lower sales in USD terms. The 2018 trade sales figure excludes sales to CSI, which in 2019 were intercompany sales.\nUSD-denominated sales of devices to end-users in Australia by Femcare's Australia distribution subsidiary (Femcare Australia Pty Ltd) were 12% lower in 2019 compared to 2018. The FX impact subtracted $126 (6.9%) from 2019 sales, explaining 57% of the lower sales.\nUSD-denominated sales of devices to end-users in Canada by UTMD's Canada distribution subsidiary (Utah Medical Products Canada, Inc.) were 18% lower in 2019 compared to 2018. The FX impact subtracted $54 (2.5%) from 2019 sales, explaining 14% of the lower sales.\nUTMD groups its sales into four general product categories: 1) obstetrics, comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well-being, for reducing risk in performing difficult delivery procedures and for improving clinician and patient safety; 2) gynecology/ electrosurgery/ urology, comprised of tools for gynecological procedures associated primarily with cervical/ uterine disease including LETZ, endometrial tissue sampling, transvaginal uterine sonography, diagnostic laparoscopy, surgical contraception and other MIS procedures; specialty excision and incision tools; conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices; and urology surgical procedure devices; 3) neonatal critical care, comprised of devices that provide developmentally-friendly care to the most critically ill babies, including providing vascular access, enteral feeding, administering vital fluids, oxygen therapy while maintaining a neutral thermal environment, providing protection and assisting in specialized applications; and 4) blood pressure monitoring/ accessories/ other, comprised of specialized transducers and components as well as molded parts and assemblies sold on an OEM basis to other companies. In these four categories, UTMD's primary revenue contributors enjoy significant brand awareness by clinical users.\nGlobal revenues by product category:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Obstetrics\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,447\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,499\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gynecology/ Electrosurgery/ Urology\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,354\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23,167\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23,175\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Neonatal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,066\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,436\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,154\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Blood Pressure Monitoring and Accessories*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,484\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,948\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,586\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,904\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,998\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,414\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOUS revenues by product category:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Obstetrics\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gynecology/ Electrosurgery/ Urology\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,731\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,759\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Neonatal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,412\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,252\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,105\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Blood Pressure Monitoring and Accessories*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,321\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,834\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,533\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,411\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,806\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,129\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*includes molded components and finished medical and non-medical devices sold to OEM customers.\nLooking forward to 2020, there again appear to be several offsetting influences on projected sales which may not be minor. Although FX rates over the course of the year are not predictable, the projected strength of the U.S. economy as well as geopolitical tensions suggest that the USD is unlikely to weaken relative to other currencies in 2020. A stronger USD reduced total sales 1.3% in 2019. UTMD's OUS distributor varying order patterns are likely to continue, but hopefully offsetting one another. UTMD's 2020 sales of BPM products to its China distributor, based on its initial annual fixed order, are projected to be $220 lower than in 2019, a year in which sales to this distributor were $662 higher than in 2018. On the other hand, based on recent activity, 2020 sales of neonatal products to international distributors are likely to be higher by about the same $220 amount. In order to stay ahead of its rapid growth by building inventory, UTMD's largest OEM customer substantially increased 2019 purchases from UTMD in the U.S. and Ireland by $2,407. It seems likely to UTMD that purchases from this customer in 2020 may be at least $700 lower than in 2019 to more closely match its actual growth in demand. UTMD's sales of its niche L&D and gynecology devices excluding the Filshie Clip System are stable, but slow growing. Although the Company remains optimistic about increasing sales of its proven safe and very effective Filshie Clip System for tubal ligation, particularly in the U.S., growth may also be slow as an adjunct from the negative social media that has confused complications of Bayer's Essure tubal ligation device, which was removed from the market, with the Filshie Clip System. In summary, management currently believes overall UTMD year 2020 USD-denominated consolidated revenues are likely to not increase more than low single percentage digits.\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>b) </td> <td> Gross Profit (GP).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUTMD's 2019 consolidated GP, the surplus after subtracting costs of manufacturing, which includes purchasing raw materials, forming components, assembling, inspecting, testing, packaging and sterilizing products, from net revenues, was $29,466 (62.8% of sales) compared to $26,306 in 2018 (62.6% of sales) and $26,395 (63.7% of sales) in 2017. GP in 2019 increased $3,161, which was 64.4% of the $4,906 increase in sales.\nUTMD's expected 2019 GPM increase was damped by the need to sell the remaining Filshie Clip System inventory obtained from CSI as part of UTMD's acquisition of the remaining life of CSI's exclusive U.S. distribution agreement. The CSI inventory was purchased by UTMD at CSI's prior distributor price from Femcare. In other words, the margin received by UTMD from selling the CSI remaining inventory during most of 2019 was limited to the distributor margin, not the margin over the manufacturing cost.\nIn addition, there was a product mix change in 2019 which affected GPMs because OEM sales, which grew faster than other sales categories, have inherently lower GPMs than direct end-user device sales. With OEM sales, another entity incurs operating expenses including sales and marketing (S&M) expenses, as well as much of product development (R&D) and general and administrative (G&A) expenses. In addition to the product mix change, actual raw material price increases and increased freight-in expense from raw material vendors helped damp the GPM. However, fixed manufacturing overhead costs were diluted by higher sales and, despite higher loaded (by benefits and taxes) labor costs, the Company maintained direct labor productivity in 2019 consistent with the prior year.\nBecause UTMD's medical devices are differentiated and not subject to GPO agreements or other significant commodity pricing pressures, the Company was able to avoid unit sales price reductions.\nUTMD's Ireland subsidiary's (UTMD Ltd's) GP was EUR 2,908 in 2019 compared to EUR 3,606 in 2018 and EUR 3,234 in 2017. The associated GPMs were 43.1% in 2019, 49.8% in 2018, and 47.5% in 2017. Despite higher trade sales, the lower GP and GPM in 2019 were due to much lower intercompany sales of Sterishot (Filshie) kits manufactured by UTMD Ltd. due to lower sales in Canada and Australia, and the need to deplete the CSI inventory in the U.S. In addition, the $662 higher China distributor BPM sales, priced at a very low GPM compared to other device sales, were from UTMD Ltd.\nFemcare UK GP was GBP 3,884 in 2019 compared to GBP 5,010 in 2018 and GBP 5,317 in 2017. The lower GP in 2019 was due to the fact that the UK had no sales of Filshie Clip System devices to CSI in 2019 compared to $3,296 in 2018, and had limited intercompany Filshie Clip System device sales to the U.S. because of the need to deplete the CSI inventory. The UK 2019 GPM was 70.2% compared to 71.7% in both 2018 and 2017.\nFemcare Australia and Femcare Canada are purely distribution facilities for UTMD finished devices in their respective countries. Australia GP was AUD 1,415 in 2019, compared to AUD 1,526 in 2018 and AUD 1,846 in 2017. In addition to 5.8% lower AUD sales, Femcare Australia GP were further leveraged lower as a weaker AUD raises the AUD cost of finished devices purchased from other UTMD subsidiaries in their fixed currency terms. The respective Femcare Australia GPMs were 57.7% in 2019, 58.7% in 2018, and 62.7% in 2017. Canada GP was CAD 1,670 in 2019 (54.5% of sales) compared to CAD 1,999 in 2018 (60.0% of sales) and 2,300 (60.2% of sales) in 2017, its first year of operation. The 16% lower GP was due to 16% lower CAD sales in 2019 compared to 2018, UTMD's weakest sales region.\nIn the U.S., GP was $19,180 in 2019, compared to $13,065 in 2018 and $12,497 in 2017. UTMD U.S. GPMs were 57.1% in 2019, 54.1% in 2018, and 55.0% in 2017. Because UTMD in the U.S. grew its trade sales by 36% including direct sales of Filshie Clip System devices, and maintained its intercompany sales of components and finished devices, despite the high growth in lower margin OEM product sales, it was able to increase GP by 47%.\nA summation of the above 2019 GP of each subsidiary will not yield consolidated total GP because of elimination of profit in inventory of intercompany goods. UTMD expects an increase in its consolidated 2020 GPM.\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>c) </td> <td> Operating Income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Income results from subtracting operating expenses from GP. Operating Income in 2019 was $17,632 (37.6% of sales) compared to $18,697 in 2018 (44.5% of sales), and $19,011 (45.9% of sales) in 2017. The lower 2019 Operating Income margin reflected the new CSI IIA amortization expense (8.6% of sales) included in General and Administrative (G&A) operating expenses. Excluding non-cash Femcare and CSI IIA amortization expenses, UTMD consolidated operating expenses were 12.2% of sales in 2019, compared to 13.0% in 2018 and 12.9% in 2017.\nThe UTMD Ltd (Ireland) Operating Income margin in 2019 was 38.5% compared to 45.9% in 2018, and 42.7% in 2017. Femcare UK's 2019 Operating Income margin was 27.8% compared to 38.1% in 2018, and 40.1% in 2017. Femcare Australia's 2019 Operating Income margin was 38.6% compared to 45.4% in 2018, and 50.0% in 2017. Femcare Canada's 2019 Operating Income margin was 41.9% compared to 49.1% in 2018, and 51.5% in 2017. UTMD's 2019 Operating Income margin in the U.S. was 33.7% compared to 39.1% in 2018, and 39.8% in 2017. The new CSI IIA amortization expense hit the 2019 U.S. Operating Income margin, and the Femcare IIA amortization expense hit the Femcare UK Operating Income margin in years 2017-2019.\nOperating expenses include sales and marketing (S&M) expenses, product development (R&D) expenses and G&A expenses. Consolidated operating expenses were $11,834 (25.2% of sales) in 2019, $7,608 (18.1% of sales) in 2018 and $7,385 (17.8% of sales) in 2017.

In markets where UTMD sells directly to end-users, which in 2017-2019 included the U.S., Ireland, UK, Australia, France and Canada, the largest components of S&M expenses were the cost of employing direct sales representatives, including associated costs of attending trade shows, travel, subsistence and communications; the cost of customer service required to timely process orders; and the distribution costs associated with shipping products. A trade-off for the higher GP obtained from selling directly at end-user prices is higher S&M expenses.\nS&M expenses include all customer support costs including training. In general, training is not required for UTMD's products since they are well-established and have been clinically widely used. Written Instructions For Use\u201d are packaged with all finished devices. Although UTMD does not have any explicit contracts with customers to provide training, it does provide hospital in-service and clinical training as required and reasonably requested.\nUTMD promises prospective customers that it will provide, at no charge in reasonable quantities, electronic media and other instructional materials developed for the use of its products. UTMD provides customer support from offices in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, UK and Australia by telephone to answer user questions and help troubleshoot any user issues. Occasionally, on a case-by-case basis, UTMD may utilize the services of an independent practitioner to provide educational assistance to clinicians. All in-service and training expenses are routinely expensed as they occur. Except for the consulting services of independent practitioners and occasional use of marketing consultants, all of these services are allocated from fixed S&M overhead costs. Historically, additional consulting costs have been immaterial to financial results, which is also UTMD's expectation for the future.\nii) R&D expenses:\nR&D expenses were $483 (1.0% of sales) in 2019 compared to $454 (1.1% of sales) in 2018, and $447 (1.1% of sales) in 2017. R&D expenses include the costs of investigating clinical needs, developing innovative concepts, testing concepts for viability, validating methods of manufacture, completing any necessary premarketing clinical trials, regulatory documentation and other activities required for design control, responding to customer requests for product enhancements, and assisting manufacturing engineering on an ongoing basis in developing new processes or improving existing processes. Although no new UTMD devices were launched in 2019, R&D played a significant and continuing role in manufacturing process improvements that were needed to support fast growing OEM product sales, in addition to continuing work on new product projects. UTMD does not pre-announce new devices that are being developed.\niii) G&A expenses:\nG&A expenses in 2019 were $9,613 (20.5% of sales) compared to $5,447 (13.0% of sales) in 2018 and $5,393 (13.0% of sales) in 2017. G&A expenses include the front office\u201d functional costs of executive management and outside directors, finance and accounting, corporate information systems, human resources, stockholder relations, corporate risk management, corporate governance, protection of intellectual property, amortization of identifiable intangibles and legal costs. The table above helps clarify certain specific categories of G&A expenses of interest to stockholders. Amortization of the 2011 acquired Femcare IIA is part of G&A expenses. Although the IIA GBP amortization expense in 2019 was the same as in 2018, because of the weaker GBP for the year as a whole, the USD 2019 IIA amortization expense was $94 lower than in 2018. The resulting G&A noncash amortization expense of Femcare IIA was 4.3% of total consolidated 2019 sales compared to 5.1% of total 2018 sales, and 5.0% of total sales in 2017. The Femcare IIA amortization expense will continue until March 2026 (or until the value of any remaining IIA becomes impaired).\nThe early 2019 $21,000 purchase of CSI exclusive Filshie Clip System U.S. distribution rights became an IIA which will be amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining life of the Femcare distribution agreement with CSI which was through 3Q 2023. This new IIA amortization expense included in G&A expenses, which began in February 2019, was $4,053 in 2019 (8.6% of total sales). The 2019 new CSI IIA amortization expense exceeded UTMD's increase in GP by $892. In 2020, a full year's CSI IIA amortization expense will be $4,421. In contrast to 2019, as a result of management's projected 2020 increase in GPM, the GP benefit of acquiring the CSI distribution agreement should exceed the IIA amortization expense.\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>d) </td> <td> Non-operating income/Non-operating expense, and Earnings Before Taxes (EBT).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-operating income includes royalties from licensing UTMD's technology, rent from leasing underutilized property to others, income earned from investing the Company's excess cash and gains from the sale of assets. Non-operating expense includes interest on bank loans, bank service fees, excise taxes and losses from the sale of assets. Also, the period-to-period remeasured value of EUR cash balances held in the UK, and GBP balances held in Ireland, generates a gain or loss which is booked at reporting period end as non-operating income or expense, as applicable.\nNet non-operating income (combination of non-operating income and non-operating expense) was $252 in 2019 compared to $761 in 2018, and $71 in 2017. The non-operating income in 2018 included a $450 gain from the sales of assets which did not recur in 2019. A description of components of UTMD's non-operating income or expense follows:\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> 1)\n</td> <td> Interest Expense. There was no interest expense in 2017-2019.

If the Company were to need to borrow to pay for a major asset or acquisition, the projected EBITDA metric would be of primary interest to a lending institution to determine UTMD's credit worthiness. Although the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission advises that EBITDA is a non-GAAP metric, UTMD's non-US GAAP EBITDA is the sum of the following elements in the table below, each of which is a US GAAP number:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBT\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,884\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,458\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,082\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Femcare IIA Amortization Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,037\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,130\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,055\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CSI IIA Amortization Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,053\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Non-Cash Amortization Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock Option Compensation Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remeasured Foreign Currency Balances\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (13\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> UTMD non-US GAAP EBITDA:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,917\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,464\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,979\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn summary, UTMD's 2019 non-US GAAP EBITDA grew 10.9% compared to 2018, despite lower EBT. This is indicative of the benefit of UTMD's acquisition of the CSI distribution agreement.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>e) </td> <td> Net Income, Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Return on Equity (ROE).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Income\nNet Income results after subtracting a provision for estimated income taxes from EBT. UTMD's US GAAP Net Income in 2019 was $14,727 (31.4% of sales) compared to $18,555 (44.2% of sales) in 2018, and $8,505 (20.5% of sales) in 2017. Because of changes in tax estimates for the years 2017-2019 due to the TCJA enacted in December 2017, management does not believe either that the estimated tax provisions have a direct relationship to sales in the same periods, or that the year-to-year changes in US GAAP Net Income is indicative of UTMD's financial performance. Ignoring the REPAT and associated TCJA tax adjustments in 2017-2019, 2019 non-US GAAP Net Income was $14,145 (30.2% of sales) compared to 2018 non-US GAAP Net Income of $15,504 (36.9% of sales), and non-US GAAP Net Income of $14,562 (35.2% of sales) in 2017.\nAdding to the difference in 2019 Operating Income compared to 2018, US GAAP Net Income and EPS in 2019 were affected by another change in UTMD's estimate of its State tax liability under the TCJA. Stockholders may recall that UTMD recorded a 3Q 2018 favorable $3,230 adjustment to its initial estimate of the combined Federal and Utah State IRC 965 transition (REPAT) tax recorded in 4Q 2017 financial results, and an unfavorable $129 adjustment in 4Q 2018 for the new Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) tax. The 2018 tax estimate adjustments made to UTMD's income tax provision had a substantial positive impact on U.S. GAAP 2018 Net Income and EPS with which 2019 results are compared. As additional IRS guidance has become available, and the State of Utah's policy for the calculation of its REPAT tax and GILTI tax has become more clear despite lack of published guidance, UTMD's independent tax advisors have recently recommended a further $582 favorable estimate adjustment, which has been recorded in UTMD's 4Q 2019 income tax provision. The adjustment emanates from an updated estimate of the 2017 Utah REPAT tax, application of Utah rules for income apportionment and further clarification of the new Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) regime associated with the GILTI regime as part of the TCJA. In summary, UTMD's initial $6,288 conservative estimate of the combined Federal and State REPAT tax has ended up, after two subsequent adjustments, to only be $2,792. In addition, the new GILTI tax on foreign subsidiary income is more than offset by the FDII tax credit for UTMD's exports of devices manufactured in the U.S. Despite management's initial comments after the TCJA was enacted, the resulting lower income taxes looking forward should be of substantial benefit to stockholders.\nThe US GAAP consolidated income tax provision rate for 2019 was 17.7% of EBT compared to 4.6% of EBT in 2018, and 55.4% of EBT in 2017. The non-US GAAP consolidated combined income tax provision rate for 2019 was 20.9% of EBT compared to 20.3% of EBT in 2018 and 23.7% in 2017. In general, year-to-year fluctuations in the combined tax provision rate will result from variation in EBT contribution from subsidiaries in jurisdictions with different corporate income tax rates. Taxes in foreign subsidiaries are based on taxable EBT in those sovereignties, which can be different from the contribution to consolidated EBT per US GAAP.\nThe UK had an income tax rate of 20% in 1Q 2017 and a rate of 19% thereafter. The UK also allows a tax deduction for sales of UK patented products which varies from year-to-year based on somewhat complicated rules which are sorted out for UTMD by independent UK tax specialists. The 2019 UK income tax rate of 19% is scheduled to decline to 17% beginning April 1, 2020. The income tax rate for AUS has been and is planned to remain at 30%. The income tax rate for Canada was and is expected to remain at about 26%. Profits of the Ireland subsidiary are taxed at a 12.5% rate on exported manufactured products, and a 25% rate on rental and other types of income including income from sales of medical devices in Ireland domestically. As UTMD stockholders likely know, in the U.S. the current Federal income tax rate is 21%, down from 34% prior to the TCJA. Federal taxes are not 21% of U.S. EBT, however, as income taxes paid to the State are a deductible expense for Federal tax purposes, other expenses are not deductible and there remains an R&D tax credit along with other credits, not to mention the new GILTI tax and FDII tax credit. The State income tax rate declined to 4.95% from 5% prior to the TCJA, but the State has enacted new income apportionment rules that provide for additional tax relief, and has its own (not formally published yet) rules for calculating the State REPAT, GILTI and FDII provisions of the TCJA.\nEPS\nEPS are Net Income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding (diluted to take into consideration stock option awards which are in the money,\u201d i.e., have exercise prices below the applicable period's weighted average market value). Diluted EPS in 2019 per US GAAP were $3.939 ($3.784 prior to the State REPAT tax correction) compared to $4.950 ($4.136 prior to the REPAT tax correction and GILTI tax provision) in 2018, and $2.276 in 2017 ($3.897 prior to the REPAT tax and DTL adjustment). The 2019 non-US GAAP EPS result met management's projection at the beginning of the year.\nThe 2019-ending weighted average number of diluted common shares (the number used to calculate diluted EPS) was 3,739 (in thousands) compared to 3,749 in 2018, and 3,737 shares in 2017. Dilution for in the money\u201d unexercised options for the year 2019 was 18 (in thousands) compared to18 shares in 2018, and 19 shares in 2017. Actual outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2019 were 3,722.\nUTMD management believes that the presentation of Net Income and EPS results excluding the REPAT tax liability estimate in 2017 and adjustments in 2018 and 2019 provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is more clearly indicative of UTMD's bottom line results in comparing 2019 to the prior years 2018 and 2017. Net Income and EPS are presented below both according to GAAP and also prior to recognition of various tax estimates related to the TCJA.\nUS GAAP:\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,727\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,555\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,505\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income Margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 31.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 44.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EPS\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.939\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.950\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.276\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-US GAAP (excluding TCJA REPAT tax in 2017 and adjustments in 2018 and 2019):\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,145\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,504\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,562\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income Margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 30.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 36.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EPS\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.784\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.136\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.897\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNote: The tax provision adjustments only affected UTMD's income tax provision, Net Income and EPS, not consolidated revenues (sales), GP, Operating Income or EBT.\nThe Company believes that investors benefit from referring to the non-US GAAP financial measures above in assessing UTMD's performance. The non-US GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons for purposes of planning future performance. The non-US GAAP financial measures disclosed by UTMD should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated.\nTo summarize 2019 financial results, UTMD achieved substantial growth in domestic revenues, but due to the strength of the USD, realized lower USD-denominated sales and demand OUS. Although GP grew consistent with sales, UTMD's GPM did not expand as much as expected to cover the new IIA amortization expense associated with the acquisition of the exclusive U.S. distribution rights for the Filshie Clip System from CSI. As a result, Operating Income was 5.7% lower than in 2018 despite continued excellent management of operating expenses. Without the same non-operating income benefit of asset sales in 2018, UTMD's 2019 non-US GAAP Net Income (ignoring tax estimate changes in both 2019 and 2018) declined 8.8% and non-US GAAP EPS declined 8.5% because of slightly lower diluted shares outstanding. Net Income and EPS met management's projections provided to stockholders at the beginning of the year (excluding the favorable income tax provision estimate adjustments).\nLooking forward, because of the lack of predictability of UTMD's largest OEM customer's demand, the variability of FX rates affecting UTMD's foreign currency sales not to mention OUS distributor demand patterns, and expected slower growth in Filshie Clip System demand, management conservatively projects 2020 consolidated sales about the same as in 2019. An expected higher GPM, however, should fuel UTMD's continued growth in its non-US GAAP EBITDA metric. In a U.S. presidential election year, considering the rhetoric of leading candidates, that's about as specific as the Company can be in projecting the future.\nROE\nMaintaining a high ROE is a key management objective for UTMD in order to grow without diluting stockholder interest. ROE is the quotient of Net Income divided by average Stockholders' Equity, but more specifically it is the product of the Net Income margin, productivity of assets and financial leverage. Although UTMD's high Net Income margin is the primary factor that continues to drive its ROE, cash dividends to stockholders and repurchase of shares help in lowering average Stockholders' Equity, reducing the denominator in calculating ROE. Before dividends, UTMD's 2019 ROE was 14.9% compared to 18.6% in 2018, and 19.8% in 2017 excluding the effect of the tax adjustments on Net Income associated with the TCJA. The lower 2019 ROE was the result of 8.8% lower non-US GAAP NI and 13.7% higher average Stockholders' Equity.\nBecause of its magnitude, the REPAT tax estimate in 2017, and estimate adjustments in both 2018 and 2019, had a significant impact on the overall ROE ratios, even though the REPAT tax amounts reduce both the numerator and denominator. UTMD's 2019 ROE before stockholder dividends (with US GAAP Net Income) was 15.5%. In comparison, 2018 ROE was 22.2%, and 2017 ROE was 4.6% with US GAAP Net Income. Because of the impact on Net Income from the over-estimate of the REPAT tax in 2017 and the corrections in 2018 and 2019, stockholders might consider that the average ROE of 14% is more indicative of results in all three years. Average Stockholders' Equity was $95,042 in 2019 compared to $83,557 in 2018, and $73,683 in 2017. Maintaining a high ROE with the dilutive effect of rapidly growing Average Stockholders' Equity (despite reductions from dividends and stock repurchases) suggests an excellent increase in stockholder value.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows.\nNet cash provided by operating activities, including adjustments for depreciation and other non-cash operating expenses, along with changes in working capital and the tax benefit attributable to exercise of employee incentive stock options, totaled $17,056 in 2019 compared to $16,834 in 2018, and $16,908 in 2017. Changes in 2019 changes in cash from operating activities compared to 2018 changes (second order derivative) were largely related to the REPAT tax and acquisition of the CSI distribution rights: 1) largely with regard to the REPAT tax, $3,827 smaller US GAAP net income, a $2,397 smaller adjustment reduction to the long term REPAT tax payable, and a $1,093 larger decrease in accrued liabilities (taxes payable); and 2) largely with regard to the CSI acquisition, a $3,953 increase in non-cash amortization expense, a $1,442 larger increase in inventories and a $242 larger increase in accounts receivable. In addition, in 2019 UTMD realized a $457 smaller gain on disposal of assets including investments compared to 2018. Other changes were generally consistent with prior year changes relative to effective working capital management and sales activity.\nIn investing activities, during 2019 UTMD used $540 to purchase new molds and manufacturing equipment to maintain and improve operating capabilities, compared to using $402 for that purpose in 2018. Also in 2019, UTMD used $21,000 to purchase the remaining life of CSI's exclusive U.S. distribution rights for the Filshie Clip System.\nIn 2019 UTMD received $283 and issued 7,042 shares of stock upon the exercise of employee and director stock options. Employees and directors exercised a total of 7,110 option shares in 2019, with 68 shares immediately being retired as a result of optionees trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options. Option exercises in 2019 were at an average price of $40.80 per share. The Company received a $23 tax benefit from option exercises in 2019, which is reflected in net income as a result of adopting a new accounting standard in 2017. UTMD repurchased 5,000 shares of its stock in the open market during 2019 at an average cost of $79.52 per share.\nIn comparison, in 2018 UTMD received $454 and issued 13,283 shares of stock upon the exercise of employee and director stock options. Employees and directors exercised a total of 15,722 option shares in 2018, with 2,439 shares immediately being retired as a result of optionees trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options. Option exercises in 2018 were at an average price of $43.22 per share. The Company received a $49 tax benefit from option exercises in 2018, which is reflected in net income as a result of adopting a new accounting standard in 2017. UTMD repurchased 15,000 shares of its stock in the open market during 2018 at an average cost of $80.35 per share.\nIn 2017 UTMD received $302 and issued 8,302 shares of stock upon the exercise of employee and director stock options. Employees and directors exercised a total of 8,638 option shares in 2017, with 336 shares immediately being retired as a result of optionees trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options. Option exercises in 2017 were at an average price of $37.83 per share. The Company received a $38 tax benefit from option exercises in 2017, which is reflected in net income as a result of adopting a new accounting standard in 2017. UTMD did not repurchase any shares of its stock in the open market during 2017.\nUTMD did not borrow in any of the three years 2017-2019. Cash dividends paid to stockholders were $4,112 in 2019 compared to $4,026 in 2018, and $2,955 in 2017. The $1,005 cash dividend declared for 4Q 2017 was paid in early January 2018, a change from the dividend declared in 4Q 2016, which was paid in late December 2016.\nManagement believes that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to finance internal growth plans. In an uncertain economic environment, UTMD's cash balances allow management to operate with the long-term best interest of stockholders in mind. Planned 2020 capital expenditures for ongoing operations are expected to be more than depreciation of PP&E, primarily because the Midvale facility will receive a new roof costing about $300 with an expected 15-year useful life.\nManagement plans to utilize cash not needed to support normal operations in one or a combination of the following: 1) in general, to continue to invest at opportune times in ways that will enhance future profitability; 2) to make additional investments in new technology and/or processes; and/or 3) to acquire a product line or company that will augment revenue and EPS growth and better utilize UTMD's existing infrastructure. If there are no better strategic uses for UTMD's cash, the Company will continue to return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases when the stock appears undervalued.\nManagement's Outlook.\nUTMD is small, but its employees are experienced and remain diligent in their work. UTMD's passion is in providing differentiated clinical solutions that will help improve the effectiveness of medical procedures and reduce health risks, particularly for women and their babies.\nThe safety, reliability and performance of UTMD's medical devices are high and represent significant clinical benefits while providing minimum total cost of care. UTMD will continue to leverage its reputation as a device innovator which will responsively take on challenges to work with clinicians who use its specialty devices. In doing so, UTMD will continue to differentiate itself, especially from commodity-oriented competitors. In 2020, UTMD again plans to\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> 1)\n</td> <td> exploit distribution and manufacturing synergies by further integrating capabilities and resources in its multinational operations;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2)\n</td> <td> focus on effectively direct marketing the benefits of the Filshie Clip System in the U.S.;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3)\n</td> <td> introduce additional products helpful to clinicians through internal new product development;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4)\n</td> <td> continue to achieve excellent overall financial operating performance;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 5)\n</td> <td> utilize positive cash generation to continue providing cash dividends to stockholders and make open market share repurchases if/when the UTMD share price seems undervalued; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6)\n</td> <td> be vigilant for accretive acquisition opportunities which may be brought about by difficult burdens on small, innovative companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has a fundamental focus to do an excellent job in meeting clinicians' and patients' needs, while providing stockholders with excellent returns. In 2019, the value of UTMD's stock increased 30%, ending the year at $107.90/ share, while $1.10 in cash dividends/ share were paid. In comparison, the DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ indices were up 22%, 29% and 35% respectively in 2019.\nTaking a longer term view, as of the end of 2019 from the end of 1998, UTMD's share price increased 1,544%, representing a 14.3% annually compounded share price increase over the twenty-one year time span. If additional returns to stockholders from cash dividends are added, stockholder value increased 1,780% over the twenty-one year time span, representing 15.0% annually compounded growth in value. In comparison to UTMD's 1,544% increase in stock value over the past twenty-one years, the NASDAQ Composite Index was up 309%, the S&P 500 Index was up 163% and the DJIA was up 211%.\nCombining share price appreciation as a result of a long term profitable financial performance and a capital allocation strategy that includes opportunistic share repurchases with steadily growing quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders since 2004, longer term UTMD stockholders have experienced excellent returns. Management is committed to continue that performance.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of UTMD's significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2025 and\nthereafter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,504\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,405\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,058\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,465\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nManagement bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. This forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Management has identified the following as the Company's most critical accounting policies which require significant judgment and estimates.

(Nasdaq: UTMD) began to realize accretive profits net of the quarterly amortization of the purchase price paid to CooperSurgical Inc. (CSI) for the acquisition of exclusive Filshie Clip System distribution rights in the U.S. The 4Q results allowed UTMD to meet its beginning of 2019 year projections to stockholders for the year as a whole.\nIncome statement results in 2019 compared to 2018 were as follows:\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,904\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,998\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> +11.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Profit (GP)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 29,466\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 26,306\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> +12.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17,633\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,697\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5.7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Before Tax (EBT)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17,884\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,458\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (8.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income before TCJA tax adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,145\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,504\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (8.8\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income per US GAAP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,727\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,555\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (20.6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EPS before TCJA tax adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.784\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.136\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (8.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings per Share (EPS) per US GAAP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.939\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.950\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (20.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 2019 sales increase was the result of 30% higher U.S. domestic sales, led by a $3,501 increase in domestic sales of the Filshie Clip System and $2,222 higher U.S. pressure transducer kit sales to an OEM customer. Sales outside the U.S. (OUS) were 7% lower, about half of which ($631) was the result of a lower foreign currency exchange (FX) rate when converting foreign currency sales to USD. Operating Income and EBT were lower due to a new $4,053 noncash expense in 2019 resulting from amortizing the $21,000 purchase price of acquiring the remaining life of the U.S. exclusive distribution rights for the Filshie Clip System in February 2019.\nNet Income and EPS per U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) in both 2019 and 2018 were affected by a change in UTMD's estimate of the IRC 965 Transition (REPAT) Tax initially booked in 2017 resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (TCJA) enacted by Congress in December 2017, and the concomitant ensuing Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) tax and Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) tax credit which liability began in 2018. US GAAP Net Sales, GP, Operating Income and EBT were not affected by the TCJA tax estimate-related adjustments in 2019 or 2018. The adjustments to UTMD's income tax estimates are more fully explained later in this report. Because of the TCJA-related tax estimate adjustments, in UTMD management's view, a comparison of US GAAP Net Income and EPS between 2019 and 2018 does not provide stockholders with meaningful insight about UTMD's financial performance. The non-GAAP results presented above eliminate the TCJA-related tax estimate adjustments from Net Income and EPS.\nThe associated key 2019 profit margins (profits as a percentage of sales) compared to the 2018 calendar year follow:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Profit Margin (GPM)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 62.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 62.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income Margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 37.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 44.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Before Tax Margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 38.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 46.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income Margin before TCJA tax adjusts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 30.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 36.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income Margin per US GAAP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 31.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 44.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMeasures of the Company's liquidity and overall financial condition improved as of the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018 as the result of continued strong positive cash flow from normal operations. The Company's continued excellent positive cash flow in 2019 allowed it to increase cash dividends paid to stockholders, repurchase 5,000 UTMD shares in the open market, use $23,048 to repurchase Filshie Clip System exclusive distribution rights and inventory from CSI and use $540 in cash for maintaining Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) in good working order.\nIn spite of the above uses of $28,097 in cash, UTMD's cash equivalent balances at the end of 2019 declined just $8,325 to $42,787 compared to $51,112 at the end of 2018. Working capital declined just $4,206 to $51,438 at the end of 2019 from $55,643 at the end of 2018. Total liabilities decreased $2,082. The Company remained without debt. UTMD's total debt ratio (total liabilities to total assets) was 8% at the end of 2019 compared to 11% at the end of 2018. Stockholders' Equity increased to $101,092 from $88,992 at the end of 2018, despite the 2019 payments of $4,112 in cash dividends to stockholders and use of $398 for share repurchases, both of which reduce Stockholders' Equity.\nProductivity of Fixed Assets and Working Capital Assets.\nAssets.\nYear-end 2019 total consolidated assets were $109,787 comprised of $54,885 in current assets, $10,728 in consolidated net PP&E and $44,173 in net intangible assets. This compares to $99,768 total assets at the end of 2018 comprised of $60,903 in current assets, $10,359 in consolidated net PP&E and $28,506 in net intangible assets. Total asset turns (total consolidated sales divided by average total assets for the year) in 2019 were 45%, compared to 44% in 2018, as the growth in sales outpaced the growth in average assets.\nCurrent assets decreased $6,018 due to a $8,325 decrease in year-end cash and investments, a $786 increase in accounts and other receivables and a $1,501 increase in year-end inventories. Year-end 2019 and 2018 cash and investment balances were $42,787 and $51,112, representing 39% and 51% of total assets, respectively. Net (after allowance for doubtful accounts) year-end trade accounts receivable (A/R) balances increased $756. This was due to the 30% higher domestic sales. Average days in A/R from date of invoice on December 31, 2019 and at December 31, 2018 were both 36 days based on 4Q 2019 and 4Q 2018 shipments respectively. The Company believes any older A/R will be collected or are within its reserve balances for uncollectible amounts. Average 2019 consolidated inventory turns were 2.8 compared to 2.9 in 2018 based on the applicable year's cost of goods sold. The increase in inventories was primarily the result of beginning to directly sell the Filshie Clip System to U.S. medical facilities in 2019.\nWorking capital (current assets minus current liabilities) at year-end 2019 was 8% lower at $51,438 compared to $55,643 at year-end 2018. Consistent with Federal and State rules, the REPAT tax current liability was only $101 at the end of 2019. The end of 2019 working capital significantly exceeds UTMD's needs for normal operations, funding future organic growth and timely payment of accrued tax liabilities, in addition to allowing for substantial funding of any future acquisition without diluting stockholder interest.\nDecember 31, 2019 net $10.7 million total PP&E includes Utah, Ireland and England manufacturing molds, production tooling and equipment, test equipment, and product development laboratory equipment. In addition, PP&E includes computers and software, warehouse equipment, furniture and fixtures, facilities and real estate for all five locations in Utah, Ireland, UK, Canada and Australia. Manufacturing facilities in Utah, Ireland and the UK are standalone buildings with a combined 220,000 square feet on 15 acres of land. The distribution facilities in Australia and Canada with a combined 8,000 square feet are part of larger industrial condominiums. Management estimates the fair market value of the five owned facilities to be at least $21 million excluding the contents, the fungible value of which increases stockholder enterprise value relative to most of UTMD's industry peers which lease their facilities.\nEnding 2019 net consolidated PP&E (depreciated book value of all fixed assets) increased $369 as a result of the combination of capital expenditures of $540, depreciation of $700 and the effect of FX rates on year-end foreign subsidiary asset balances.\nThe following end-of-year FX rates in USD applied to assets and liabilities of each applicable foreign subsidiary:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n12-31-19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12-31-18\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EUR\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.1227\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.1456\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GBP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.3268\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.2760\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AUD\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.7030\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.7046\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CAD\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.7715\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.7329\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe year-end 2019 net book value (after accumulated depreciation) of consolidated PP&E was 32% of purchase cost. End-of-year PP&E turns (Net Sales divided by Net PP&E) was 4.4 in 2019 compared to 4.1 in 2018 due primarily to the 12% higher 2019 sales. A future leverage in productivity of fixed assets which will not have to be increased to support new business activity will be a source of incremental profitability.\nNet intangible assets (after accumulated amortization) are comprised of the capitalized costs of obtaining patents and other intellectual property, as well as the value of identifiable intangible assets (IIA) and goodwill resulting from acquisitions. Net intangible assets were $44,173 (40% of total assets) at the end of 2019 compared to $28,506 (29% of total assets) at the end of 2018. Per US GAAP, intangible assets are categorized as either 1) IIA, which are amortized over the estimated useful life of the assets, or 2) goodwill, which is not amortized or expensed until the associated economic value of the acquired asset becomes impaired. The two categories of Femcare intangibles at year-end 2019 were net IIA of $13,202 and goodwill of $6,770. The accumulated amortization of Femcare IIA as of December 31, 2019 since the March 18, 2011 acquisition was $18,750. The remaining Femcare IIA will be fully amortized in 6 more years. The goodwill portion of intangible assets resulting from the Femcare acquisition, which is not amortized, increased $259 due to a stronger GBP at year-end. The GBP FX rate at December 31, 2019 increased 4.0% from December 31, 2018. In 2019, UTMD acquired an additional $21,000 IIA from the purchase of the remaining life of exclusive U.S. distribution rights for the Filshie Clip System from CSI, of which $4,053 was amortized during the year. The remaining CSI IIA will be fully amortized in 4 more years. UTMD's goodwill balance including the Femcare goodwill was $13,961 at the end of 2019, 32% of total net intangibles.\nBecause the products associated with UTMD's acquisitions of Columbia Medical in 1997, Gesco in 1998, Abcorp in 2004 and Femcare in 2011 continue to be viable parts of UTMD's overall business, UTMD does not expect the current goodwill value associated with the four acquisitions to become impaired in 2020. Amortization of IIA was $6,144 in 2019 compared to $2,191 in 2018. The difference was essentially the amortization of $21,000 new IIA resulting from the acquisition of CSI remaining Filshie Clip System exclusive U.S. distribution rights in 2019. The 2019 non-cash amortization expense of Femcare IIA was $2,037 (\u00a31,595) compared to $2,130 (\u00a31,595) in 2018. The Femcare IIA amortization USD difference was again due to the change in USD/GBP FX rate. The 2020 non-cash amortization expense (included as part of operating expenses) of Femcare IIA will again be \u00a31,595, or $2,074 if the USD/GBP average FX rate is 1.30. The 2019 non-cash amortization expense of CSI IIA was $4,053 compared to zero in 2018. The 2020 operating expense resulting from amortization of CSI IIA will be $4,421.\nLiabilities.\nThe remaining $2,212 balance of the corrected $2,792 total REPAT tax liability from the TCJA is 79% instead of 84% (after the allowed 16% in the first two years of eight years' pay out), because the initial Federal and State payments were based on an initial estimate which was conservatively too high at $6,288 compared to the current adjusted estimate of $2,792. The Federal and State REPAT tax payment requirement is 8% of the respective REPAT tax liability per year for the first five years, 15% in the sixth year, 20% in the seventh year and 25% in the eighth year.\nYear-end 2019 current liabilities were $1,812 lower than at the end of 2018. Ending accrued liabilities were $1,952 lower due to lower taxes payable and lower customer deposits. Total liabilities were $2,082 lower at the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018. The resulting 2019 year-end total debt ratio was 8% compared to 11% at the end of 2018.\nThe year-end 2019 DTL balance created as a result of the fifteen year deferred tax consequence of the amortization of Femcare's IIA was $2,239, down from $2,541 at the end of 2018. The relatively small decline in this DTL considering the $2,037 in 2019 amortization of IIA (suggesting a 15% tax rate) was due to a 4% stronger GBP compared to the USD at the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018. In addition to liabilities stated on the balance sheet, UTMD has operating lease and purchase obligations described in Note 8 to the financial statements.\nResults of Operations.\na) Revenues.\nUnder accounting standards applicable for 2019, the Company believed that revenue should be recognized at the time of shipment as title generally passes to the customer at the time of shipment, or completion of services performed under contract. Revenue recognized by UTMD is based upon documented arrangements and fixed contracts in which the selling price is fixed prior to acceptance and completion of an order. Revenue from product or service sales is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped or service completed and invoiced, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Over 99% of UTMD's revenue is recognized at the time UTMD ships a physical device to a customer's designated location, where the selling price for the item shipped was agreed prior to UTMD's acceptance and completion of the customer order. There are no post-shipment obligations which have been or are expected to be material to financial results.\nThere are circumstances under which revenue may be recognized when product is not shipped, which have met the criteria of ASC 606: the Company provides engineering services, for example, design and production of manufacturing tooling that may be used in subsequent UTMD manufacturing of custom components for other companies. This revenue is recognized when UTMD's service has been completed according to a fixed contractual agreement.\nBeginning on January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, a new revenue recognition accounting standard. Management completed an extensive assessment and implementation of the standard, including UTMD's various contracts with customers and associated performance obligations and the Company's conclusions regarding its revenue recognition practices and procedures. Other items like commissions and rights of return were also evaluated by the Company. Management is confident that the Company has properly evaluated the standard's requirements and has arrived at appropriate conclusions in recognizing revenue in accordance with the new standard. Those practices and procedures the Company will use to recognize revenue under the new standard are not significantly different than the methods used previously since UTMD has traditionally recognized revenue upon shipping a physical device to a customer's designated location, which is also when the Company has met its performance obligations under contracts it has with its customers that represent over 99% of its revenue. While the Company's revenue not associated with shipping a physical product is immaterial, management believes the Company's practices in recognizing that revenue is also in accordance with ASU 2014-09.\nTerms of sale are established in advance of UTMD's acceptance of customer orders. In the U.S., Ireland, UK, France, Australia and Canada since the beginning of 2017, UTMD has generally accepted orders directly from and shipped directly to end-user clinical facilities, as well as third party medical/surgical distributors, under UTMD's Standard Terms and Conditions (T&C) of Sale. About 9% of UTMD's domestic end-user sales went through third party med/surg distributors which contract separately with clinical facilities to provide purchasing, storage and scheduled delivery functions for the applicable facility. UTMD's T&C of Sale to end-user facilities are substantially the same in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, UK, France and Australia.\nUTMD may have separate discounted pricing agreements with a specific clinical facility or group of affiliated facilities based on volume of purchases. Pricing agreements which are documented arrangements with clinical facilities, or groups of affiliated facilities, if applicable, are established in advance of orders accepted or shipments made. For existing customers, past actual shipment volumes typically determine the fixed price by part number for the next agreement period of one year. For new customers, the customer's best estimate of volume is usually accepted by UTMD for determining the ensuing fixed prices for the agreement period. Prices are not adjusted after an order is accepted. For the sake of clarity, the separate pricing agreements with clinical facilities based on volume of purchases disclosure is not inconsistent with UTMD's disclosure above that the selling price is fixed prior to the acceptance of a specific customer order.\nUTMD's global consolidated trade sales are comprised of domestic and OUS sales. Domestic sales in 2019 included 1) direct domestic sales, sales of finished devices to end-user facilities and med/surg distributors in the U.S., and 2) domestic OEM sales, sales of components or finished products, which may not be medical devices, to other companies for inclusion in their products. In 2018, domestic sales included the above two items (except that direct domestic sales did not include the Filshie Clip System) plus sales of the Filshie Clip System by Femcare UK to CSI. OUS sales are export sales from UTMD in the U.S. to customers outside the U.S. invoiced in USD, and all sales from UTMD subsidiaries in Ireland, Canada, Australia and the UK (other than Femcare UK sales to CSI in 2018) which may be invoiced in EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD or USD. The term trade\u201d means sales to customers which are not part of UTMD. Each UTMD entity had 2019 intercompany sales of components and/or finished devices to other UTMD entities.\nGlobal consolidated trade sales in 2019 were $46,904 compared to $41,998 in 2018 and $41,414 in 2017. The $4,906 (+11.7%) higher sales in 2019 were the result of several offsetting factors described below. Total U.S. domestic sales were up $6,302 (+29.7%) in 2019, at $27,493 compared to $21,192 in 2018. OUS sales were down $1,395 (6.7%) at $19,411 compared to $20,806 in 2018.\nDomestic Sales.\nU.S. domestic sales in 2019 were $27,493 (59% of total sales) compared to $21,192 (50% of total sales) in 2018. The contributors to the 2019 total $6,302 (+29.7%) higher domestic sales were $3,501 (+106%) higher sales of Filshie Clip System devices in the U.S., $2,452 (+60%) higher sales of components and finished devices used in other companies' products (OEM customers), and $349 (+3%) higher direct sales of non-Filshie finished devices to domestic end-users. Domestic sales in 2017 were $20,286.\nDomestic Filshie Clip System sales in 2019 were 25% of total U.S. domestic sales compared to 16% in 2018. The higher domestic Filshie Clip System sales occurred as a result of converting from Femcare UK sales to a domestic distributor in 2018 to UTMD sales directly to end-users in 2019.\nDomestic OEM sales in 2019 were 24% of total U.S. domestic sales compared to 19% in 2018. UTMD sold components and finished devices to 147 different U.S. companies in 2019 compared to 152 companies in 2018 for use in their product offerings. Sales to UTMD's largest OEM customer, representing 75% of total domestic OEM sales, were up $2,222 (+82%). Although this customer has projected higher purchases from UTMD in 2020, UTMD is expecting lower 2020 sales due to recognizing the customer's inventory build-up.\nDomestic direct (end-user) sales excluding the Filshie Clip System were 51% of total U.S. domestic sales in 2019 compared to 65% in 2018. Of UTMD's three main domestic direct categories, neonatal products were $4,654 (+2% higher), labor & delivery (L&D) products were $4,053 (+8% higher), and gynecology/ electrosurgery/ urology products excluding the Filshie Clip System were $4,826 (about the same).\nOUS Sales.\nSales OUS in 2019 were $19,411 (6.7% lower) compared to $20,806 in 2018. OUS sales were $21,129 in 2017.\nBecause a significant portion of UTMD's sales are invoiced in foreign currencies, changes in FX rates can potentially have a material effect on period-to-period USD-denominated sales. UTMD's FX rates for income statement purposes are transaction-weighted averages. The average rates from the applicable foreign currency to USD during 2019 compared to 2018 follow:\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GBP\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.277\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.334\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4.3\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EUR\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.119\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.180\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (5.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AUD\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.696\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.747\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (6.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CAD\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.754\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.773\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales weighted-average change:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>%) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nForty-five percent ($631) of the $1,395 lower OUS sales were due to the changes in FX rates (stronger USD in 2019). EUR currency sales in 2019 were reduced $277 compared to what the same EUR sales in 2018 would have been expressed in USD. GBP currency sales in 2019 were reduced $174 compared to what the same GBP sales in 2018 would have been expressed in USD. AUD currency sales in 2019 were reduced $126 compared to what the same AUD sales in 2018 would have been expressed in USD. CAD currency sales in 2019 were reduced $54 compared to what the same CAD sales in 2018 would have been expressed in USD.\nSixty-six percent of (USD denominated) 2019 OUS sales were invoiced in foreign currencies compared to 67% in 2018. As a portion of total USD consolidated sales, 27% of UTMD's USD-equivalent sales were invoiced in foreign currencies in 2019 compared to 33% in 2018. The GBP, EUR, AUD and CAD converted sales represented 8%, 11%, 4% and 4% of total 2019 USD sales, respectively. This compares to 10% GBP, 12% EUR, 5% AUD and 6% CAD of total 2018 USD sales. The lower converted foreign currency sales percentages of total sales in 2019 were not only due to the stronger USD, but also much higher domestic sales.\nVariations in order pattern of UTMD's China distributors, one for BPM devices and another for neonatal devices, continue to be significant from year-to-year. The China BPM distributor purchased $662 more and the China neonatal device distributor $519 less in 2019 compared to 2018, largely offsetting one another. UTMD expects that the reverse might be the case in 2020.\nUSD-denominated trade (excludes intercompany) sales of devices to OUS customers by UTMD's Ireland facility (UTMD Ltd) were $5,894 (+18%) in 2019 compared to $5,008 in 2018. As the EUR was down 5.1% relative to the USD in 2019, the FX impact subtracted $277 from 2019 sales. In other words, constant currency sales were $6,171 (+23%). UTMD Ltd produces the BPM devices sold to UTMD's China distributor. In constant EUR currency and eliminating sales of BPM devices to its China distributor in both years 2019 and 2018, 2019 Ireland trade sales experienced 13% growth compared to 2018.\nIn 2019, UTMD's UK subsidiary, Femcare Ltd., had $5,382 trade sales of devices to domestic UK, domestic France and international distributor customers, down 8% compared to $5,849 in 2018. The FX impact subtracted $174 (4.3%) from 2019 sales, explaining about half of the lower sales in USD terms. The 2018 trade sales figure excludes sales to CSI, which in 2019 were intercompany sales.\nUSD-denominated sales of devices to end-users in Australia by Femcare's Australia distribution subsidiary (Femcare Australia Pty Ltd) were 12% lower in 2019 compared to 2018. The FX impact subtracted $126 (6.9%) from 2019 sales, explaining 57% of the lower sales.\nUSD-denominated sales of devices to end-users in Canada by UTMD's Canada distribution subsidiary (Utah Medical Products Canada, Inc.) were 18% lower in 2019 compared to 2018. The FX impact subtracted $54 (2.5%) from 2019 sales, explaining 14% of the lower sales.\nUTMD groups its sales into four general product categories: 1) obstetrics, comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well-being, for reducing risk in performing difficult delivery procedures and for improving clinician and patient safety; 2) gynecology/ electrosurgery/ urology, comprised of tools for gynecological procedures associated primarily with cervical/ uterine disease including LETZ, endometrial tissue sampling, transvaginal uterine sonography, diagnostic laparoscopy, surgical contraception and other MIS procedures; specialty excision and incision tools; conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices; and urology surgical procedure devices; 3) neonatal critical care, comprised of devices that provide developmentally-friendly care to the most critically ill babies, including providing vascular access, enteral feeding, administering vital fluids, oxygen therapy while maintaining a neutral thermal environment, providing protection and assisting in specialized applications; and 4) blood pressure monitoring/ accessories/ other, comprised of specialized transducers and components as well as molded parts and assemblies sold on an OEM basis to other companies. In these four categories, UTMD's primary revenue contributors enjoy significant brand awareness by clinical users.\nGlobal revenues by product category:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Obstetrics\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,447\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,499\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gynecology/ Electrosurgery/ Urology\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25,354\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23,167\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23,175\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Neonatal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,066\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,436\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,154\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Blood Pressure Monitoring and Accessories*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,484\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,948\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,586\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,904\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,998\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,414\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOUS revenues by product category:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Obstetrics\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gynecology/ Electrosurgery/ Urology\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,731\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,022\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,759\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Neonatal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,412\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,252\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,105\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Blood Pressure Monitoring and Accessories*\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,321\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,834\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,533\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,411\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,806\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,129\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*includes molded components and finished medical and non-medical devices sold to OEM customers.\nLooking forward to 2020, there again appear to be several offsetting influences on projected sales which may not be minor. Although FX rates over the course of the year are not predictable, the projected strength of the U.S. economy as well as geopolitical tensions suggest that the USD is unlikely to weaken relative to other currencies in 2020. A stronger USD reduced total sales 1.3% in 2019. UTMD's OUS distributor varying order patterns are likely to continue, but hopefully offsetting one another. UTMD's 2020 sales of BPM products to its China distributor, based on its initial annual fixed order, are projected to be $220 lower than in 2019, a year in which sales to this distributor were $662 higher than in 2018. On the other hand, based on recent activity, 2020 sales of neonatal products to international distributors are likely to be higher by about the same $220 amount. In order to stay ahead of its rapid growth by building inventory, UTMD's largest OEM customer substantially increased 2019 purchases from UTMD in the U.S. and Ireland by $2,407. It seems likely to UTMD that purchases from this customer in 2020 may be at least $700 lower than in 2019 to more closely match its actual growth in demand. UTMD's sales of its niche L&D and gynecology devices excluding the Filshie Clip System are stable, but slow growing. Although the Company remains optimistic about increasing sales of its proven safe and very effective Filshie Clip System for tubal ligation, particularly in the U.S., growth may also be slow as an adjunct from the negative social media that has confused complications of Bayer's Essure tubal ligation device, which was removed from the market, with the Filshie Clip System. In summary, management currently believes overall UTMD year 2020 USD-denominated consolidated revenues are likely to not increase more than low single percentage digits.\n b) Gross Profit (GP). \nUTMD's 2019 consolidated GP, the surplus after subtracting costs of manufacturing, which includes purchasing raw materials, forming components, assembling, inspecting, testing, packaging and sterilizing products, from net revenues, was $29,466 (62.8% of sales) compared to $26,306 in 2018 (62.6% of sales) and $26,395 (63.7% of sales) in 2017. GP in 2019 increased $3,161, which was 64.4% of the $4,906 increase in sales.\nUTMD's expected 2019 GPM increase was damped by the need to sell the remaining Filshie Clip System inventory obtained from CSI as part of UTMD's acquisition of the remaining life of CSI's exclusive U.S. distribution agreement. The CSI inventory was purchased by UTMD at CSI's prior distributor price from Femcare. In other words, the margin received by UTMD from selling the CSI remaining inventory during most of 2019 was limited to the distributor margin, not the margin over the manufacturing cost.\nIn addition, there was a product mix change in 2019 which affected GPMs because OEM sales, which grew faster than other sales categories, have inherently lower GPMs than direct end-user device sales. With OEM sales, another entity incurs operating expenses including sales and marketing (S&M) expenses, as well as much of product development (R&D) and general and administrative (G&A) expenses. In addition to the product mix change, actual raw material price increases and increased freight-in expense from raw material vendors helped damp the GPM. However, fixed manufacturing overhead costs were diluted by higher sales and, despite higher loaded (by benefits and taxes) labor costs, the Company maintained direct labor productivity in 2019 consistent with the prior year.\nBecause UTMD's medical devices are differentiated and not subject to GPO agreements or other significant commodity pricing pressures, the Company was able to avoid unit sales price reductions.\nUTMD's Ireland subsidiary's (UTMD Ltd's) GP was EUR 2,908 in 2019 compared to EUR 3,606 in 2018 and EUR 3,234 in 2017. The associated GPMs were 43.1% in 2019, 49.8% in 2018, and 47.5% in 2017. Despite higher trade sales, the lower GP and GPM in 2019 were due to much lower intercompany sales of Sterishot (Filshie) kits manufactured by UTMD Ltd. due to lower sales in Canada and Australia, and the need to deplete the CSI inventory in the U.S. In addition, the $662 higher China distributor BPM sales, priced at a very low GPM compared to other device sales, were from UTMD Ltd.\nFemcare UK GP was GBP 3,884 in 2019 compared to GBP 5,010 in 2018 and GBP 5,317 in 2017. The lower GP in 2019 was due to the fact that the UK had no sales of Filshie Clip System devices to CSI in 2019 compared to $3,296 in 2018, and had limited intercompany Filshie Clip System device sales to the U.S. because of the need to deplete the CSI inventory. The UK 2019 GPM was 70.2% compared to 71.7% in both 2018 and 2017.\nFemcare Australia and Femcare Canada are purely distribution facilities for UTMD finished devices in their respective countries. Australia GP was AUD 1,415 in 2019, compared to AUD 1,526 in 2018 and AUD 1,846 in 2017. In addition to 5.8% lower AUD sales, Femcare Australia GP were further leveraged lower as a weaker AUD raises the AUD cost of finished devices purchased from other UTMD subsidiaries in their fixed currency terms. The respective Femcare Australia GPMs were 57.7% in 2019, 58.7% in 2018, and 62.7% in 2017. Canada GP was CAD 1,670 in 2019 (54.5% of sales) compared to CAD 1,999 in 2018 (60.0% of sales) and 2,300 (60.2% of sales) in 2017, its first year of operation. The 16% lower GP was due to 16% lower CAD sales in 2019 compared to 2018, UTMD's weakest sales region.\nIn the U.S., GP was $19,180 in 2019, compared to $13,065 in 2018 and $12,497 in 2017. UTMD U.S. GPMs were 57.1% in 2019, 54.1% in 2018, and 55.0% in 2017. Because UTMD in the U.S. grew its trade sales by 36% including direct sales of Filshie Clip System devices, and maintained its intercompany sales of components and finished devices, despite the high growth in lower margin OEM product sales, it was able to increase GP by 47%.\nA summation of the above 2019 GP of each subsidiary will not yield consolidated total GP because of elimination of profit in inventory of intercompany goods. UTMD expects an increase in its consolidated 2020 GPM.\n c) Operating Income. \nOperating Income results from subtracting operating expenses from GP. Operating Income in 2019 was $17,632 (37.6% of sales) compared to $18,697 in 2018 (44.5% of sales), and $19,011 (45.9% of sales) in 2017. The lower 2019 Operating Income margin reflected the new CSI IIA amortization expense (8.6% of sales) included in General and Administrative (G&A) operating expenses. Excluding non-cash Femcare and CSI IIA amortization expenses, UTMD consolidated operating expenses were 12.2% of sales in 2019, compared to 13.0% in 2018 and 12.9% in 2017.\nThe UTMD Ltd (Ireland) Operating Income margin in 2019 was 38.5% compared to 45.9% in 2018, and 42.7% in 2017. Femcare UK's 2019 Operating Income margin was 27.8% compared to 38.1% in 2018, and 40.1% in 2017. Femcare Australia's 2019 Operating Income margin was 38.6% compared to 45.4% in 2018, and 50.0% in 2017. Femcare Canada's 2019 Operating Income margin was 41.9% compared to 49.1% in 2018, and 51.5% in 2017. UTMD's 2019 Operating Income margin in the U.S. was 33.7% compared to 39.1% in 2018, and 39.8% in 2017. The new CSI IIA amortization expense hit the 2019 U.S. Operating Income margin, and the Femcare IIA amortization expense hit the Femcare UK Operating Income margin in years 2017-2019.\nOperating expenses include sales and marketing (S&M) expenses, product development (R&D) expenses and G&A expenses. Consolidated operating expenses were $11,834 (25.2% of sales) in 2019, $7,608 (18.1% of sales) in 2018 and $7,385 (17.8% of sales) in 2017. The following table provides a comparison of operating expense categories, as well as further segmentation of G&A expenses, for the last three years.\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> S&M expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,738\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,708\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,544\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> R&D expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> G&A expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> a)\n</td> <td> litigation expense provision\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> b)\n</td> <td> corporate legal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> c)\n</td> <td> stock option compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> d)\n</td> <td> management bonus accrual\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> e)\n</td> <td> outside accounting audit/tax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> f)\n</td> <td> Femcare IIA amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,037\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,131\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,055\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> g)\n</td> <td> CSI IIA amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,053\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> h)\n</td> <td> property & liability insurance premiums\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> i)\n</td> <td> all other G&A expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,652\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,491\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,367\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> G&A expenses - total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,613\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,447\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,393\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Consolidated Operating Expense:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,834\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,608\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,385\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percent of sales:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDescription of Operating Expense Categories\ni) S&M expenses:\nS&M expenses in 2019 were $1,738 (3.7% of 2019 sales) compared to $1,708 (4.1% of 2018 sales), and $1,544 (3.7% of sales) in 2017.\nS&M expenses are the costs of communicating UTMD's differences and product advantages, providing training and other customer service in support of the use of UTMD's solutions, attending clinical meetings and medical trade shows, administering customer agreements, advertising, processing orders, shipping, and paying commissions to outside independent representatives. In markets where UTMD sells directly to end-users, which in 2017-2019 included the U.S., Ireland, UK, Australia, France and Canada, the largest components of S&M expenses were the cost of employing direct sales representatives, including associated costs of attending trade shows, travel, subsistence and communications; the cost of customer service required to timely process orders; and the distribution costs associated with shipping products. A trade-off for the higher GP obtained from selling directly at end-user prices is higher S&M expenses.\nS&M expenses include all customer support costs including training. In general, training is not required for UTMD's products since they are well-established and have been clinically widely used. Written Instructions For Use\u201d are packaged with all finished devices. Although UTMD does not have any explicit contracts with customers to provide training, it does provide hospital in-service and clinical training as required and reasonably requested.\nUTMD promises prospective customers that it will provide, at no charge in reasonable quantities, electronic media and other instructional materials developed for the use of its products. UTMD provides customer support from offices in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, UK and Australia by telephone to answer user questions and help troubleshoot any user issues. Occasionally, on a case-by-case basis, UTMD may utilize the services of an independent practitioner to provide educational assistance to clinicians. All in-service and training expenses are routinely expensed as they occur. Except for the consulting services of independent practitioners and occasional use of marketing consultants, all of these services are allocated from fixed S&M overhead costs. Historically, additional consulting costs have been immaterial to financial results, which is also UTMD's expectation for the future.\nii) R&D expenses:\nR&D expenses were $483 (1.0% of sales) in 2019 compared to $454 (1.1% of sales) in 2018, and $447 (1.1% of sales) in 2017. R&D expenses include the costs of investigating clinical needs, developing innovative concepts, testing concepts for viability, validating methods of manufacture, completing any necessary premarketing clinical trials, regulatory documentation and other activities required for design control, responding to customer requests for product enhancements, and assisting manufacturing engineering on an ongoing basis in developing new processes or improving existing processes. Although no new UTMD devices were launched in 2019, R&D played a significant and continuing role in manufacturing process improvements that were needed to support fast growing OEM product sales, in addition to continuing work on new product projects. UTMD does not pre-announce new devices that are being developed.\niii) G&A expenses:\nG&A expenses in 2019 were $9,613 (20.5% of sales) compared to $5,447 (13.0% of sales) in 2018 and $5,393 (13.0% of sales) in 2017. G&A expenses include the front office\u201d functional costs of executive management and outside directors, finance and accounting, corporate information systems, human resources, stockholder relations, corporate risk management, corporate governance, protection of intellectual property, amortization of identifiable intangibles and legal costs. The table above helps clarify certain specific categories of G&A expenses of interest to stockholders. Amortization of the 2011 acquired Femcare IIA is part of G&A expenses. Although the IIA GBP amortization expense in 2019 was the same as in 2018, because of the weaker GBP for the year as a whole, the USD 2019 IIA amortization expense was $94 lower than in 2018. The resulting G&A noncash amortization expense of Femcare IIA was 4.3% of total consolidated 2019 sales compared to 5.1% of total 2018 sales, and 5.0% of total sales in 2017. The Femcare IIA amortization expense will continue until March 2026 (or until the value of any remaining IIA becomes impaired).\nThe early 2019 $21,000 purchase of CSI exclusive Filshie Clip System U.S. distribution rights became an IIA which will be amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining life of the Femcare distribution agreement with CSI which was through 3Q 2023. This new IIA amortization expense included in G&A expenses, which began in February 2019, was $4,053 in 2019 (8.6% of total sales). The 2019 new CSI IIA amortization expense exceeded UTMD's increase in GP by $892. In 2020, a full year's CSI IIA amortization expense will be $4,421. In contrast to 2019, as a result of management's projected 2020 increase in GPM, the GP benefit of acquiring the CSI distribution agreement should exceed the IIA amortization expense.\n d) Non-operating income/Non-operating expense, and Earnings Before Taxes (EBT). \nNon-operating income includes royalties from licensing UTMD's technology, rent from leasing underutilized property to others, income earned from investing the Company's excess cash and gains from the sale of assets. Non-operating expense includes interest on bank loans, bank service fees, excise taxes and losses from the sale of assets. Also, the period-to-period remeasured value of EUR cash balances held in the UK, and GBP balances held in Ireland, generates a gain or loss which is booked at reporting period end as non-operating income or expense, as applicable.\nNet non-operating income (combination of non-operating income and non-operating expense) was $252 in 2019 compared to $761 in 2018, and $71 in 2017. The non-operating income in 2018 included a $450 gain from the sales of assets which did not recur in 2019. A description of components of UTMD's non-operating income or expense follows:\n 1) Interest Expense. There was no interest expense in 2017-2019. Absent an acquisition or large repurchase of shares that requires new borrowing, UTMD does not expect any interest expense in 2020. 2) Investment of excess cash. Consolidated investment income (including gains and losses on sales of investments) was $255 in 2019 compared to $248 in 2018, and $17 in 2017. Prior to 2018, cash was generally held in non-interest bearing bank accounts because avoiding the bank operating fees which would result from lower balances offset the low interest that could be earned at then current interest rates. 3) Royalties. Femcare received a royalty from licensing the use of the Filshie Clip System intangibles to CSI as part of its U.S. exclusive distribution agreement. Royalties in 2019 were $5 compared to $76 in 2018, and $86 in 2017. UTMD did not receive a CSI royalty in 2019 after January because of the purchase of the distribution agreement. Presently, there are no other arrangements under which UTMD is receiving royalties from other parties. 4) Gains/ losses from remeasured currency in bank accounts. UTMD recognized a non-operating expense of $76 in 2019 compared to non-operating income of $13 in 2018, and non-operating income of $4 in 2017 from losses or gains on remeasured foreign currency bank balances. EUR and AUD currency cash balances in the UK, and GBP currency cash bank balances in Ireland, are subject to remeasured currency translation gains/ losses as a result of period to period changes in FX rates. Because of UTMD's subsidiaries' profitability, the subsidiaries may continue to accumulate cash until uses of cash that increase stockholder value are identified. 5) Other non-operating income or expense. Income received from renting unused warehouse space in Ireland and parking lot space in Utah for a cell phone tower, offset by bank fees, and other miscellaneous non-operating expenses resulted in a net non-operating expense of $85 in 2019 compared to $3 in 2018 and $36 in 2017. \nEBT results from adding net non-operating income or subtracting net non-operating expense from Operating Income. Consolidated EBT was $17,884 (38.1% of sales) in 2019 compared to $19,458 (46.3% of sales) in 2018, and $19,082 (46.1% of sales) in 2017. The 2019 EBT of UTMD Ltd. (Ireland) was \u20ac2,577 (38.2% of sales) compared to \u20ac3,144 (43.4% of sales) in 2018, and \u20ac2,779 (40.8% of sales) in 2017. Femcare UK's 2019 EBT was \u00a31,566 (28.3% of sales) compared to \u00a32,896 (41.5% of sales) in 2018, and \u00a33,155 (42.5% of sales) in 2017. Femcare AUS's 2019 EBT was AUD 952 (38.8% of sales) compared to AUD 1,183 (45.5% of sales) in 2018, and AUD 1,473 (50.0% of sales) in 2017. Femcare Canada's 2019 EBT was CAD 1,280 (41.8% of sales) compared to CAD 1,632 (49.0% of sales) in 2018, and 1,906 (49.9% of sales) in 2017.\nAs a side note for clarity of financial results, UTMD's 2019, 2018 and 2017 EBT, as well as all other income statement measures above the EBT line in the Income Statements, were unaffected by estimates of the REPAT tax and associated GILTI tax and FDII tax credit, all of which resulted from the TCJA enacted in late 2017.\nEBITDA is a non-US GAAP metric that UTMD management believes is of interest to investors because it provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that represents profitability performance without factoring in effects of financing, accounting decisions regarding non-cash expenses, capital expenditures or tax environments. If the Company were to need to borrow to pay for a major asset or acquisition, the projected EBITDA metric would be of primary interest to a lending institution to determine UTMD's credit worthiness. Although the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission advises that EBITDA is a non-GAAP metric, UTMD's non-US GAAP EBITDA is the sum of the following elements in the table below, each of which is a US GAAP number:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBT\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,884\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,458\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,082\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Femcare IIA Amortization Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,037\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,130\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,055\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CSI IIA Amortization Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,053\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Non-Cash Amortization Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock Option Compensation Expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remeasured Foreign Currency Balances\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (13\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> UTMD non-US GAAP EBITDA:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,917\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,464\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,979\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn summary, UTMD's 2019 non-US GAAP EBITDA grew 10.9% compared to 2018, despite lower EBT. This is indicative of the benefit of UTMD's acquisition of the CSI distribution agreement.\n e) Net Income, Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Return on Equity (ROE). \nNet Income\nNet Income results after subtracting a provision for estimated income taxes from EBT. UTMD's US GAAP Net Income in 2019 was $14,727 (31.4% of sales) compared to $18,555 (44.2% of sales) in 2018, and $8,505 (20.5% of sales) in 2017. Because of changes in tax estimates for the years 2017-2019 due to the TCJA enacted in December 2017, management does not believe either that the estimated tax provisions have a direct relationship to sales in the same periods, or that the year-to-year changes in US GAAP Net Income is indicative of UTMD's financial performance. Ignoring the REPAT and associated TCJA tax adjustments in 2017-2019, 2019 non-US GAAP Net Income was $14,145 (30.2% of sales) compared to 2018 non-US GAAP Net Income of $15,504 (36.9% of sales), and non-US GAAP Net Income of $14,562 (35.2% of sales) in 2017.\nAdding to the difference in 2019 Operating Income compared to 2018, US GAAP Net Income and EPS in 2019 were affected by another change in UTMD's estimate of its State tax liability under the TCJA. Stockholders may recall that UTMD recorded a 3Q 2018 favorable $3,230 adjustment to its initial estimate of the combined Federal and Utah State IRC 965 transition (REPAT) tax recorded in 4Q 2017 financial results, and an unfavorable $129 adjustment in 4Q 2018 for the new Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) tax. The 2018 tax estimate adjustments made to UTMD's income tax provision had a substantial positive impact on U.S. GAAP 2018 Net Income and EPS with which 2019 results are compared. As additional IRS guidance has become available, and the State of Utah's policy for the calculation of its REPAT tax and GILTI tax has become more clear despite lack of published guidance, UTMD's independent tax advisors have recently recommended a further $582 favorable estimate adjustment, which has been recorded in UTMD's 4Q 2019 income tax provision. The adjustment emanates from an updated estimate of the 2017 Utah REPAT tax, application of Utah rules for income apportionment and further clarification of the new Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) regime associated with the GILTI regime as part of the TCJA. In summary, UTMD's initial $6,288 conservative estimate of the combined Federal and State REPAT tax has ended up, after two subsequent adjustments, to only be $2,792. In addition, the new GILTI tax on foreign subsidiary income is more than offset by the FDII tax credit for UTMD's exports of devices manufactured in the U.S. Despite management's initial comments after the TCJA was enacted, the resulting lower income taxes looking forward should be of substantial benefit to stockholders.\nThe US GAAP consolidated income tax provision rate for 2019 was 17.7% of EBT compared to 4.6% of EBT in 2018, and 55.4% of EBT in 2017. The non-US GAAP consolidated combined income tax provision rate for 2019 was 20.9% of EBT compared to 20.3% of EBT in 2018 and 23.7% in 2017. In general, year-to-year fluctuations in the combined tax provision rate will result from variation in EBT contribution from subsidiaries in jurisdictions with different corporate income tax rates. Taxes in foreign subsidiaries are based on taxable EBT in those sovereignties, which can be different from the contribution to consolidated EBT per US GAAP.\nThe UK had an income tax rate of 20% in 1Q 2017 and a rate of 19% thereafter. The UK also allows a tax deduction for sales of UK patented products which varies from year-to-year based on somewhat complicated rules which are sorted out for UTMD by independent UK tax specialists. The 2019 UK income tax rate of 19% is scheduled to decline to 17% beginning April 1, 2020. The income tax rate for AUS has been and is planned to remain at 30%. The income tax rate for Canada was and is expected to remain at about 26%. Profits of the Ireland subsidiary are taxed at a 12.5% rate on exported manufactured products, and a 25% rate on rental and other types of income including income from sales of medical devices in Ireland domestically. As UTMD stockholders likely know, in the U.S. the current Federal income tax rate is 21%, down from 34% prior to the TCJA. Federal taxes are not 21% of U.S. EBT, however, as income taxes paid to the State are a deductible expense for Federal tax purposes, other expenses are not deductible and there remains an R&D tax credit along with other credits, not to mention the new GILTI tax and FDII tax credit. The State income tax rate declined to 4.95% from 5% prior to the TCJA, but the State has enacted new income apportionment rules that provide for additional tax relief, and has its own (not formally published yet) rules for calculating the State REPAT, GILTI and FDII provisions of the TCJA.\nEPS\nEPS are Net Income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding (diluted to take into consideration stock option awards which are in the money,\u201d i.e., have exercise prices below the applicable period's weighted average market value). Diluted EPS in 2019 per US GAAP were $3.939 ($3.784 prior to the State REPAT tax correction) compared to $4.950 ($4.136 prior to the REPAT tax correction and GILTI tax provision) in 2018, and $2.276 in 2017 ($3.897 prior to the REPAT tax and DTL adjustment). The 2019 non-US GAAP EPS result met management's projection at the beginning of the year.\nThe 2019-ending weighted average number of diluted common shares (the number used to calculate diluted EPS) was 3,739 (in thousands) compared to 3,749 in 2018, and 3,737 shares in 2017. Dilution for in the money\u201d unexercised options for the year 2019 was 18 (in thousands) compared to18 shares in 2018, and 19 shares in 2017. Actual outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2019 were 3,722.\nUTMD management believes that the presentation of Net Income and EPS results excluding the REPAT tax liability estimate in 2017 and adjustments in 2018 and 2019 provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is more clearly indicative of UTMD's bottom line results in comparing 2019 to the prior years 2018 and 2017. Net Income and EPS are presented below both according to GAAP and also prior to recognition of various tax estimates related to the TCJA.\nUS GAAP:\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,727\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,555\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,505\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income Margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 31.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 44.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EPS\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.939\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.950\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.276\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-US GAAP (excluding TCJA REPAT tax in 2017 and adjustments in 2018 and 2019):\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,145\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,504\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,562\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Income Margin\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 30.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 36.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 35.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EPS\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.784\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.136\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.897\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNote: The tax provision adjustments only affected UTMD's income tax provision, Net Income and EPS, not consolidated revenues (sales), GP, Operating Income or EBT.\nThe Company believes that investors benefit from referring to the non-US GAAP financial measures above in assessing UTMD's performance. The non-US GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons for purposes of planning future performance. The non-US GAAP financial measures disclosed by UTMD should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated.\nTo summarize 2019 financial results, UTMD achieved substantial growth in domestic revenues, but due to the strength of the USD, realized lower USD-denominated sales and demand OUS. Although GP grew consistent with sales, UTMD's GPM did not expand as much as expected to cover the new IIA amortization expense associated with the acquisition of the exclusive U.S. distribution rights for the Filshie Clip System from CSI. As a result, Operating Income was 5.7% lower than in 2018 despite continued excellent management of operating expenses. Without the same non-operating income benefit of asset sales in 2018, UTMD's 2019 non-US GAAP Net Income (ignoring tax estimate changes in both 2019 and 2018) declined 8.8% and non-US GAAP EPS declined 8.5% because of slightly lower diluted shares outstanding. Net Income and EPS met management's projections provided to stockholders at the beginning of the year (excluding the favorable income tax provision estimate adjustments).\nLooking forward, because of the lack of predictability of UTMD's largest OEM customer's demand, the variability of FX rates affecting UTMD's foreign currency sales not to mention OUS distributor demand patterns, and expected slower growth in Filshie Clip System demand, management conservatively projects 2020 consolidated sales about the same as in 2019. An expected higher GPM, however, should fuel UTMD's continued growth in its non-US GAAP EBITDA metric. In a U.S. presidential election year, considering the rhetoric of leading candidates, that's about as specific as the Company can be in projecting the future.\nROE\nMaintaining a high ROE is a key management objective for UTMD in order to grow without diluting stockholder interest. ROE is the quotient of Net Income divided by average Stockholders' Equity, but more specifically it is the product of the Net Income margin, productivity of assets and financial leverage. Although UTMD's high Net Income margin is the primary factor that continues to drive its ROE, cash dividends to stockholders and repurchase of shares help in lowering average Stockholders' Equity, reducing the denominator in calculating ROE. Before dividends, UTMD's 2019 ROE was 14.9% compared to 18.6% in 2018, and 19.8% in 2017 excluding the effect of the tax adjustments on Net Income associated with the TCJA. The lower 2019 ROE was the result of 8.8% lower non-US GAAP NI and 13.7% higher average Stockholders' Equity.\nBecause of its magnitude, the REPAT tax estimate in 2017, and estimate adjustments in both 2018 and 2019, had a significant impact on the overall ROE ratios, even though the REPAT tax amounts reduce both the numerator and denominator. UTMD's 2019 ROE before stockholder dividends (with US GAAP Net Income) was 15.5%. In comparison, 2018 ROE was 22.2%, and 2017 ROE was 4.6% with US GAAP Net Income. Because of the impact on Net Income from the over-estimate of the REPAT tax in 2017 and the corrections in 2018 and 2019, stockholders might consider that the average ROE of 14% is more indicative of results in all three years. Average Stockholders' Equity was $95,042 in 2019 compared to $83,557 in 2018, and $73,683 in 2017. Maintaining a high ROE with the dilutive effect of rapidly growing Average Stockholders' Equity (despite reductions from dividends and stock repurchases) suggests an excellent increase in stockholder value.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows.\nNet cash provided by operating activities, including adjustments for depreciation and other non-cash operating expenses, along with changes in working capital and the tax benefit attributable to exercise of employee incentive stock options, totaled $17,056 in 2019 compared to $16,834 in 2018, and $16,908 in 2017. Changes in 2019 changes in cash from operating activities compared to 2018 changes (second order derivative) were largely related to the REPAT tax and acquisition of the CSI distribution rights: 1) largely with regard to the REPAT tax, $3,827 smaller US GAAP net income, a $2,397 smaller adjustment reduction to the long term REPAT tax payable, and a $1,093 larger decrease in accrued liabilities (taxes payable); and 2) largely with regard to the CSI acquisition, a $3,953 increase in non-cash amortization expense, a $1,442 larger increase in inventories and a $242 larger increase in accounts receivable. In addition, in 2019 UTMD realized a $457 smaller gain on disposal of assets including investments compared to 2018. Other changes were generally consistent with prior year changes relative to effective working capital management and sales activity.\nIn investing activities, during 2019 UTMD used $540 to purchase new molds and manufacturing equipment to maintain and improve operating capabilities, compared to using $402 for that purpose in 2018. Also in 2019, UTMD used $21,000 to purchase the remaining life of CSI's exclusive U.S. distribution rights for the Filshie Clip System.\nIn 2019 UTMD received $283 and issued 7,042 shares of stock upon the exercise of employee and director stock options. Employees and directors exercised a total of 7,110 option shares in 2019, with 68 shares immediately being retired as a result of optionees trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options. Option exercises in 2019 were at an average price of $40.80 per share. The Company received a $23 tax benefit from option exercises in 2019, which is reflected in net income as a result of adopting a new accounting standard in 2017. UTMD repurchased 5,000 shares of its stock in the open market during 2019 at an average cost of $79.52 per share.\nIn comparison, in 2018 UTMD received $454 and issued 13,283 shares of stock upon the exercise of employee and director stock options. Employees and directors exercised a total of 15,722 option shares in 2018, with 2,439 shares immediately being retired as a result of optionees trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options. Option exercises in 2018 were at an average price of $43.22 per share. The Company received a $49 tax benefit from option exercises in 2018, which is reflected in net income as a result of adopting a new accounting standard in 2017. UTMD repurchased 15,000 shares of its stock in the open market during 2018 at an average cost of $80.35 per share.\nIn 2017 UTMD received $302 and issued 8,302 shares of stock upon the exercise of employee and director stock options. Employees and directors exercised a total of 8,638 option shares in 2017, with 336 shares immediately being retired as a result of optionees trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options. Option exercises in 2017 were at an average price of $37.83 per share. The Company received a $38 tax benefit from option exercises in 2017, which is reflected in net income as a result of adopting a new accounting standard in 2017. UTMD did not repurchase any shares of its stock in the open market during 2017.\nUTMD did not borrow in any of the three years 2017-2019. Cash dividends paid to stockholders were $4,112 in 2019 compared to $4,026 in 2018, and $2,955 in 2017. The $1,005 cash dividend declared for 4Q 2017 was paid in early January 2018, a change from the dividend declared in 4Q 2016, which was paid in late December 2016.\nManagement believes that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to finance internal growth plans. In an uncertain economic environment, UTMD's cash balances allow management to operate with the long-term best interest of stockholders in mind. Planned 2020 capital expenditures for ongoing operations are expected to be more than depreciation of PP&E, primarily because the Midvale facility will receive a new roof costing about $300 with an expected 15-year useful life.\nManagement plans to utilize cash not needed to support normal operations in one or a combination of the following: 1) in general, to continue to invest at opportune times in ways that will enhance future profitability; 2) to make additional investments in new technology and/or processes; and/or 3) to acquire a product line or company that will augment revenue and EPS growth and better utilize UTMD's existing infrastructure. If there are no better strategic uses for UTMD's cash, the Company will continue to return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases when the stock appears undervalued.\nManagement's Outlook.\nUTMD is small, but its employees are experienced and remain diligent in their work. UTMD's passion is in providing differentiated clinical solutions that will help improve the effectiveness of medical procedures and reduce health risks, particularly for women and their babies.\nThe safety, reliability and performance of UTMD's medical devices are high and represent significant clinical benefits while providing minimum total cost of care. UTMD will continue to leverage its reputation as a device innovator which will responsively take on challenges to work with clinicians who use its specialty devices. In doing so, UTMD will continue to differentiate itself, especially from commodity-oriented competitors. In 2020, UTMD again plans to\n 1) exploit distribution and manufacturing synergies by further integrating capabilities and resources in its multinational operations; 2) focus on effectively direct marketing the benefits of the Filshie Clip System in the U.S.; 3) introduce additional products helpful to clinicians through internal new product development; 4) continue to achieve excellent overall financial operating performance; 5) utilize positive cash generation to continue providing cash dividends to stockholders and make open market share repurchases if/when the UTMD share price seems undervalued; and 6) be vigilant for accretive acquisition opportunities which may be brought about by difficult burdens on small, innovative companies. \nThe Company has a fundamental focus to do an excellent job in meeting clinicians' and patients' needs, while providing stockholders with excellent returns. In 2019, the value of UTMD's stock increased 30%, ending the year at $107.90/ share, while $1.10 in cash dividends/ share were paid. In comparison, the DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ indices were up 22%, 29% and 35% respectively in 2019.\nTaking a longer term view, as of the end of 2019 from the end of 1998, UTMD's share price increased 1,544%, representing a 14.3% annually compounded share price increase over the twenty-one year time span. If additional returns to stockholders from cash dividends are added, stockholder value increased 1,780% over the twenty-one year time span, representing 15.0% annually compounded growth in value. In comparison to UTMD's 1,544% increase in stock value over the past twenty-one years, the NASDAQ Composite Index was up 309%, the S&P 500 Index was up 163% and the DJIA was up 211%.\nCombining share price appreciation as a result of a long term profitable financial performance and a capital allocation strategy that includes opportunistic share repurchases with steadily growing quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders since 2004, longer term UTMD stockholders have experienced excellent returns. Management is committed to continue that performance.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of UTMD's significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n2025 and\nthereafter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,504\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,405\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,058\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,465\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nManagement bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. This forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Management has identified the following as the Company's most critical accounting policies which require significant judgment and estimates. Although management believes its estimates are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n \u2022 Allowance for doubtful accounts: The majority of the Company's receivables are with healthcare facilities and medical device distributors. Although the Company has historically not had significant write-offs of bad debt, the possibility exists, particularly with foreign distributors where collection efforts can be difficult or in the event of widespread hospital bankruptcies. \u2022 Inventory valuation reserves: The Company strives to maintain inventory to 1) meet its customers' needs and 2) optimize manufacturing lot sizes while 3) not tying-up an unnecessary amount of the Company's capital increasing the possibility of, among other things, obsolescence. The Company believes its method of reviewing actual and projected demand for its existing inventory allows it to arrive at a fair inventory valuation reserve. While the Company has historically not had significant inventory write-offs, the possibility exists that one or more of its products may become unexpectedly obsolete for which a reserve has not previously been created. The Company's historical write-offs have not been materially different from its estimates. \nAccounting Policy Changes\nThe Company's management has evaluated the recently issued accounting pronouncements through the filing date of these financial statements and has determined that the application of these pronouncements will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCurrency amounts are in thousands except per-share amounts and where noted. Currencies are abbreviated as follows: the U.S. Dollar (USD or $), the Great Britain Pound (GBP or \u00a3), the Euro (EUR or \u20ac), the Australian Dollar (AUD or A$) and the Canadian Dollar (CAD or C$).\nThe following comments should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements.\nOverview.\nIn the final calendar quarter (4Q) of 2019, Utah Medical Products, Inc. (Nasdaq: UTMD) began to realize accretive profits net of the quarterly amortization of the purchase price paid to CooperSurgical Inc. (CSI) for the acquisition of exclusive Filshie Clip System distribution rights in the U.S. The 4Q results allowed UTMD to meet its beginning of 2019 year projections to stockholders for the year as a whole.\nIncome statement results in 2019 compared to 2018 were as follows:\n\nThe 2019 sales increase was the result of 30% higher U.S. domestic sales, led by a $3,501 increase in domestic sales of the Filshie Clip System and $2,222 higher U.S. pressure transducer kit sales to an OEM customer. Sales outside the U.S. (OUS) were 7% lower, about half of which ($631) was the result of a lower foreign currency exchange (FX) rate when converting foreign currency sales to USD. Operating Income and EBT were lower due to a new $4,053 noncash expense in 2019 resulting from amortizing the $21,000 purchase price of acquiring the remaining life of the U.S. exclusive distribution rights for the Filshie Clip System in February 2019.\nNet Income and EPS per U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) in both 2019 and 2018 were affected by a change in UTMD's estimate of the IRC 965 Transition (REPAT) Tax initially booked in 2017 resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (TCJA) enacted by Congress in December 2017, and the concomitant ensuing Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) tax and Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) tax credit which liability began in 2018. US GAAP Net Sales, GP, Operating Income and EBT were not affected by the TCJA tax estimate-related adjustments in 2019 or 2018. The adjustments to UTMD's income tax estimates are more fully explained later in this report. Because of the TCJA-related tax estimate adjustments, in UTMD management's view, a comparison of US GAAP Net Income and EPS between 2019 and 2018 does not provide stockholders with meaningful insight about UTMD's financial performance. The non-GAAP results presented above eliminate the TCJA-related tax estimate adjustments from Net Income and EPS.\nThe associated key 2019 profit margins (profits as a percentage of sales) compared to the 2018 calendar year follow:\n\nMeasures of the Company's liquidity and overall financial condition improved as of the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018 as the result of continued strong positive cash flow from normal operations. The Company's continued excellent positive cash flow in 2019 allowed it to increase cash dividends paid to stockholders, repurchase 5,000 UTMD shares in the open market, use $23,048 to repurchase Filshie Clip System exclusive distribution rights and inventory from CSI and use $540 in cash for maintaining Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) in good working order.\nIn spite of the above uses of $28,097 in cash, UTMD's cash equivalent balances at the end of 2019 declined just $8,325 to $42,787 compared to $51,112 at the end of 2018. Working capital declined just $4,206 to $51,438 at the end of 2019 from $55,643 at the end of 2018. Total liabilities decreased $2,082. The Company remained without debt. UTMD's total debt ratio (total liabilities to total assets) was 8% at the end of 2019 compared to 11% at the end of 2018. Stockholders' Equity increased to $101,092 from $88,992 at the end of 2018, despite the 2019 payments of $4,112 in cash dividends to stockholders and use of $398 for share repurchases, both of which reduce Stockholders' Equity.\nProductivity of Fixed Assets and Working Capital Assets.\nAssets.\nYear-end 2019 total consolidated assets were $109,787 comprised of $54,885 in current assets, $10,728 in consolidated net PP&E and $44,173 in net intangible assets. This compares to $99,768 total assets at the end of 2018 comprised of $60,903 in current assets, $10,359 in consolidated net PP&E and $28,506 in net intangible assets. Total asset turns (total consolidated sales divided by average total assets for the year) in 2019 were 45%, compared to 44% in 2018, as the growth in sales outpaced the growth in average assets.\nCurrent assets decreased $6,018 due to a $8,325 decrease in year-end cash and investments, a $786 increase in accounts and other receivables and a $1,501 increase in year-end inventories. Year-end 2019 and 2018 cash and investment balances were $42,787 and $51,112, representing 39% and 51% of total assets, respectively. Net (after allowance for doubtful accounts) year-end trade accounts receivable (A/R) balances increased $756. This was due to the 30% higher domestic sales. Average days in A/R from date of invoice on December 31, 2019 and at December 31, 2018 were both 36 days based on 4Q 2019 and 4Q 2018 shipments respectively. The Company believes any older A/R will be collected or are within its reserve balances for uncollectible amounts. Average 2019 consolidated inventory turns were 2.8 compared to 2.9 in 2018 based on the applicable year's cost of goods sold. The increase in inventories was primarily the result of beginning to directly sell the Filshie Clip System to U.S. medical facilities in 2019.\nWorking capital (current assets minus current liabilities) at year-end 2019 was 8% lower at $51,438 compared to $55,643 at year-end 2018. Consistent with Federal and State rules, the REPAT tax current liability was only $101 at the end of 2019. The end of 2019 working capital significantly exceeds UTMD's needs for normal operations, funding future organic growth and timely payment of accrued tax liabilities, in addition to allowing for substantial funding of any future acquisition without diluting stockholder interest.\nDecember 31, 2019 net $10.7 million total PP&E includes Utah, Ireland and England manufacturing molds, production tooling and equipment, test equipment, and product development laboratory equipment. In addition, PP&E includes computers and software, warehouse equipment, furniture and fixtures, facilities and real estate for all five locations in Utah, Ireland, UK, Canada and Australia. Manufacturing facilities in Utah, Ireland and the UK are standalone buildings with a combined 220,000 square feet on 15 acres of land. The distribution facilities in Australia and Canada with a combined 8,000 square feet are part of larger industrial condominiums. Management estimates the fair market value of the five owned facilities to be at least $21 million excluding the contents, the fungible value of which increases stockholder enterprise value relative to most of UTMD's industry peers which lease their facilities.\nEnding 2019 net consolidated PP&E (depreciated book value of all fixed assets) increased $369 as a result of the combination of capital expenditures of $540, depreciation of $700 and the effect of FX rates on year-end foreign subsidiary asset balances.\nThe following end-of-year FX rates in USD applied to assets and liabilities of each applicable foreign subsidiary:\n\nThe year-end 2019 net book value (after accumulated depreciation) of consolidated PP&E was 32% of purchase cost. End-of-year PP&E turns (Net Sales divided by Net PP&E) was 4.4 in 2019 compared to 4.1 in 2018 due primarily to the 12% higher 2019 sales. A future leverage in productivity of fixed assets which will not have to be increased to support new business activity will be a source of incremental profitability.\nNet intangible assets (after accumulated amortization) are comprised of the capitalized costs of obtaining patents and other intellectual property, as well as the value of identifiable intangible assets (IIA) and goodwill resulting from acquisitions. Net intangible assets were $44,173 (40% of total assets) at the end of 2019 compared to $28,506 (29% of total assets) at the end of 2018. Per US GAAP, intangible assets are categorized as either 1) IIA, which are amortized over the estimated useful life of the assets, or 2) goodwill, which is not amortized or expensed until the associated economic value of the acquired asset becomes impaired. The two categories of Femcare intangibles at year-end 2019 were net IIA of $13,202 and goodwill of $6,770. The accumulated amortization of Femcare IIA as of December 31, 2019 since the March 18, 2011 acquisition was $18,750. The remaining Femcare IIA will be fully amortized in 6 more years. The goodwill portion of intangible assets resulting from the Femcare acquisition, which is not amortized, increased $259 due to a stronger GBP at year-end. The GBP FX rate at December 31, 2019 increased 4.0% from December 31, 2018. In 2019, UTMD acquired an additional $21,000 IIA from the purchase of the remaining life of exclusive U.S. distribution rights for the Filshie Clip System from CSI, of which $4,053 was amortized during the year. The remaining CSI IIA will be fully amortized in 4 more years. UTMD's goodwill balance including the Femcare goodwill was $13,961 at the end of 2019, 32% of total net intangibles.\nBecause the products associated with UTMD's acquisitions of Columbia Medical in 1997, Gesco in 1998, Abcorp in 2004 and Femcare in 2011 continue to be viable parts of UTMD's overall business, UTMD does not expect the current goodwill value associated with the four acquisitions to become impaired in 2020. Amortization of IIA was $6,144 in 2019 compared to $2,191 in 2018. The difference was essentially the amortization of $21,000 new IIA resulting from the acquisition of CSI remaining Filshie Clip System exclusive U.S. distribution rights in 2019. The 2019 non-cash amortization expense of Femcare IIA was $2,037 (\u00a31,595) compared to $2,130 (\u00a31,595) in 2018. The Femcare IIA amortization USD difference was again due to the change in USD/GBP FX rate. The 2020 non-cash amortization expense (included as part of operating expenses) of Femcare IIA will again be \u00a31,595, or $2,074 if the USD/GBP average FX rate is 1.30. The 2019 non-cash amortization expense of CSI IIA was $4,053 compared to zero in 2018. The 2020 operating expense resulting from amortization of CSI IIA will be $4,421.\nLiabilities.\nThe remaining $2,212 balance of the corrected $2,792 total REPAT tax liability from the TCJA is 79% instead of 84% (after the allowed 16% in the first two years of eight years' pay out), because the initial Federal and State payments were based on an initial estimate which was conservatively too high at $6,288 compared to the current adjusted estimate of $2,792. The Federal and State REPAT tax payment requirement is 8% of the respective REPAT tax liability per year for the first five years, 15% in the sixth year, 20% in the seventh year and 25% in the eighth year.\nYear-end 2019 current liabilities were $1,812 lower than at the end of 2018. Ending accrued liabilities were $1,952 lower due to lower taxes payable and lower customer deposits. Total liabilities were $2,082 lower at the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018. The resulting 2019 year-end total debt ratio was 8% compared to 11% at the end of 2018.\nThe year-end 2019 DTL balance created as a result of the fifteen year deferred tax consequence of the amortization of Femcare's IIA was $2,239, down from $2,541 at the end of 2018. The relatively small decline in this DTL considering the $2,037 in 2019 amortization of IIA (suggesting a 15% tax rate) was due to a 4% stronger GBP compared to the USD at the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018. In addition to liabilities stated on the balance sheet, UTMD has operating lease and purchase obligations described in Note 8 to the financial statements.\nResults of Operations.\na) Revenues.\nUnder accounting standards applicable for 2019, the Company believed that revenue should be recognized at the time of shipment as title generally passes to the customer at the time of shipment, or completion of services performed under contract. Revenue recognized by UTMD is based upon documented arrangements and fixed contracts in which the selling price is fixed prior to acceptance and completion of an order. Revenue from product or service sales is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped or service completed and invoiced, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Over 99% of UTMD's revenue is recognized at the time UTMD ships a physical device to a customer's designated location, where the selling price for the item shipped was agreed prior to UTMD's acceptance and completion of the customer order. There are no post-shipment obligations which have been or are expected to be material to financial results.\nThere are circumstances under which revenue may be recognized when product is not shipped, which have met the criteria of ASC 606: the Company provides engineering services, for example, design and production of manufacturing tooling that may be used in subsequent UTMD manufacturing of custom components for other companies. This revenue is recognized when UTMD's service has been completed according to a fixed contractual agreement.\nBeginning on January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, a new revenue recognition accounting standard. Management completed an extensive assessment and implementation of the standard, including UTMD's various contracts with customers and associated performance obligations and the Company's conclusions regarding its revenue recognition practices and procedures. Other items like commissions and rights of return were also evaluated by the Company. Management is confident that the Company has properly evaluated the standard's requirements and has arrived at appropriate conclusions in recognizing revenue in accordance with the new standard. Those practices and procedures the Company will use to recognize revenue under the new standard are not significantly different than the methods used previously since UTMD has traditionally recognized revenue upon shipping a physical device to a customer's designated location, which is also when the Company has met its performance obligations under contracts it has with its customers that represent over 99% of its revenue. While the Company's revenue not associated with shipping a physical product is immaterial, management believes the Company's practices in recognizing that revenue is also in accordance with ASU 2014-09.\nTerms of sale are established in advance of UTMD's acceptance of customer orders. In the U.S., Ireland, UK, France, Australia and Canada since the beginning of 2017, UTMD has generally accepted orders directly from and shipped directly to end-user clinical facilities, as well as third party medical/surgical distributors, under UTMD's Standard Terms and Conditions (T&C) of Sale. About 9% of UTMD's domestic end-user sales went through third party med/surg distributors which contract separately with clinical facilities to provide purchasing, storage and scheduled delivery functions for the applicable facility. UTMD's T&C of Sale to end-user facilities are substantially the same in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, UK, France and Australia.\nUTMD may have separate discounted pricing agreements with a specific clinical facility or group of affiliated facilities based on volume of purchases. Pricing agreements which are documented arrangements with clinical facilities, or groups of affiliated facilities, if applicable, are established in advance of orders accepted or shipments made. For existing customers, past actual shipment volumes typically determine the fixed price by part number for the next agreement period of one year. For new customers, the customer's best estimate of volume is usually accepted by UTMD for determining the ensuing fixed prices for the agreement period. Prices are not adjusted after an order is accepted. For the sake of clarity, the separate pricing agreements with clinical facilities based on volume of purchases disclosure is not inconsistent with UTMD's disclosure above that the selling price is fixed prior to the acceptance of a specific customer order.\nUTMD's global consolidated trade sales are comprised of domestic and OUS sales. Domestic sales in 2019 included 1) direct domestic sales, sales of finished devices to end-user facilities and med/surg distributors in the U.S., and 2) domestic OEM sales, sales of components or finished products, which may not be medical devices, to other companies for inclusion in their products. In 2018, domestic sales included the above two items (except that direct domestic sales did not include the Filshie Clip System) plus sales of the Filshie Clip System by Femcare UK to CSI. OUS sales are export sales from UTMD in the U.S. to customers outside the U.S. invoiced in USD, and all sales from UTMD subsidiaries in Ireland, Canada, Australia and the UK (other than Femcare UK sales to CSI in 2018) which may be invoiced in EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD or USD. The term trade\u201d means sales to customers which are not part of UTMD. Each UTMD entity had 2019 intercompany sales of components and/or finished devices to other UTMD entities.\nGlobal consolidated trade sales in 2019 were $46,904 compared to $41,998 in 2018 and $41,414 in 2017. The $4,906 (+11.7%) higher sales in 2019 were the result of several offsetting factors described below. Total U.S. domestic sales were up $6,302 (+29.7%) in 2019, at $27,493 compared to $21,192 in 2018. OUS sales were down $1,395 (6.7%) at $19,411 compared to $20,806 in 2018.\nDomestic Sales.\nU.S. domestic sales in 2019 were $27,493 (59% of total sales) compared to $21,192 (50% of total sales) in 2018. The contributors to the 2019 total $6,302 (+29.7%) higher domestic sales were $3,501 (+106%) higher sales of Filshie Clip System devices in the U.S., $2,452 (+60%) higher sales of components and finished devices used in other companies' products (OEM customers), and $349 (+3%) higher direct sales of non-Filshie finished devices to domestic end-users. Domestic sales in 2017 were $20,286.\nDomestic Filshie Clip System sales in 2019 were 25% of total U.S. domestic sales compared to 16% in 2018. The higher domestic Filshie Clip System sales occurred as a result of converting from Femcare UK sales to a domestic distributor in 2018 to UTMD sales directly to end-users in 2019.\nDomestic OEM sales in 2019 were 24% of total U.S. domestic sales compared to 19% in 2018. UTMD sold components and finished devices to 147 different U.S. companies in 2019 compared to 152 companies in 2018 for use in their product offerings. Sales to UTMD's largest OEM customer, representing 75% of total domestic OEM sales, were up $2,222 (+82%). Although this customer has projected higher purchases from UTMD in 2020, UTMD is expecting lower 2020 sales due to recognizing the customer's inventory build-up.\nDomestic direct (end-user) sales excluding the Filshie Clip System were 51% of total U.S. domestic sales in 2019 compared to 65% in 2018. Of UTMD's three main domestic direct categories, neonatal products were $4,654 (+2% higher), labor & delivery (L&D) products were $4,053 (+8% higher), and gynecology/ electrosurgery/ urology products excluding the Filshie Clip System were $4,826 (about the same).\nOUS Sales.\nSales OUS in 2019 were $19,411 (6.7% lower) compared to $20,806 in 2018. OUS sales were $21,129 in 2017.\nBecause a significant portion of UTMD's sales are invoiced in foreign currencies, changes in FX rates can potentially have a material effect on period-to-period USD-denominated sales. UTMD's FX rates for income statement purposes are transaction-weighted averages. The average rates from the applicable foreign currency to USD during 2019 compared to 2018 follow:\n\nForty-five percent ($631) of the $1,395 lower OUS sales were due to the changes in FX rates (stronger USD in 2019). EUR currency sales in 2019 were reduced $277 compared to what the same EUR sales in 2018 would have been expressed in USD. GBP currency sales in 2019 were reduced $174 compared to what the same GBP sales in 2018 would have been expressed in USD. AUD currency sales in 2019 were reduced $126 compared to what the same AUD sales in 2018 would have been expressed in USD. CAD currency sales in 2019 were reduced $54 compared to what the same CAD sales in 2018 would have been expressed in USD.\nSixty-six percent of (USD denominated) 2019 OUS sales were invoiced in foreign currencies compared to 67% in 2018. As a portion of total USD consolidated sales, 27% of UTMD's USD-equivalent sales were invoiced in foreign currencies in 2019 compared to 33% in 2018. The GBP, EUR, AUD and CAD converted sales represented 8%, 11%, 4% and 4% of total 2019 USD sales, respectively. This compares to 10% GBP, 12% EUR, 5% AUD and 6% CAD of total 2018 USD sales. The lower converted foreign currency sales percentages of total sales in 2019 were not only due to the stronger USD, but also much higher domestic sales.\nVariations in order pattern of UTMD's China distributors, one for BPM devices and another for neonatal devices, continue to be significant from year-to-year. The China BPM distributor purchased $662 more and the China neonatal device distributor $519 less in 2019 compared to 2018, largely offsetting one another. UTMD expects that the reverse might be the case in 2020.\nUSD-denominated trade (excludes intercompany) sales of devices to OUS customers by UTMD's Ireland facility (UTMD Ltd) were $5,894 (+18%) in 2019 compared to $5,008 in 2018. As the EUR was down 5.1% relative to the USD in 2019, the FX impact subtracted $277 from 2019 sales. In other words, constant currency sales were $6,171 (+23%). UTMD Ltd produces the BPM devices sold to UTMD's China distributor. In constant EUR currency and eliminating sales of BPM devices to its China distributor in both years 2019 and 2018, 2019 Ireland trade sales experienced 13% growth compared to 2018.\nIn 2019, UTMD's UK subsidiary, Femcare Ltd., had $5,382 trade sales of devices to domestic UK, domestic France and international distributor customers, down 8% compared to $5,849 in 2018. The FX impact subtracted $174 (4.3%) from 2019 sales, explaining about half of the lower sales in USD terms. The 2018 trade sales figure excludes sales to CSI, which in 2019 were intercompany sales.\nUSD-denominated sales of devices to end-users in Australia by Femcare's Australia distribution subsidiary (Femcare Australia Pty Ltd) were 12% lower in 2019 compared to 2018. The FX impact subtracted $126 (6.9%) from 2019 sales, explaining 57% of the lower sales.\nUSD-denominated sales of devices to end-users in Canada by UTMD's Canada distribution subsidiary (Utah Medical Products Canada, Inc.) were 18% lower in 2019 compared to 2018. The FX impact subtracted $54 (2.5%) from 2019 sales, explaining 14% of the lower sales.\nUTMD groups its sales into four general product categories: 1) obstetrics, comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well-being, for reducing risk in performing difficult delivery procedures and for improving clinician and patient safety; 2) gynecology/ electrosurgery/ urology, comprised of tools for gynecological procedures associated primarily with cervical/ uterine disease including LETZ, endometrial tissue sampling, transvaginal uterine sonography, diagnostic laparoscopy, surgical contraception and other MIS procedures; specialty excision and incision tools; conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices; and urology surgical procedure devices; 3) neonatal critical care, comprised of devices that provide developmentally-friendly care to the most critically ill babies, including providing vascular access, enteral feeding, administering vital fluids, oxygen therapy while maintaining a neutral thermal environment, providing protection and assisting in specialized applications; and 4) blood pressure monitoring/ accessories/ other, comprised of specialized transducers and components as well as molded parts and assemblies sold on an OEM basis to other companies. In these four categories, UTMD's primary revenue contributors enjoy significant brand awareness by clinical users.\nGlobal revenues by product category:\n\nOUS revenues by product category:\n\n*includes molded components and finished medical and non-medical devices sold to OEM customers.\nLooking forward to 2020, there again appear to be several offsetting influences on projected sales which may not be minor. Although FX rates over the course of the year are not predictable, the projected strength of the U.S. economy as well as geopolitical tensions suggest that the USD is unlikely to weaken relative to other currencies in 2020. A stronger USD reduced total sales 1.3% in 2019. UTMD's OUS distributor varying order patterns are likely to continue, but hopefully offsetting one another. UTMD's 2020 sales of BPM products to its China distributor, based on its initial annual fixed order, are projected to be $220 lower than in 2019, a year in which sales to this distributor were $662 higher than in 2018. On the other hand, based on recent activity, 2020 sales of neonatal products to international distributors are likely to be higher by about the same $220 amount. In order to stay ahead of its rapid growth by building inventory, UTMD's largest OEM customer substantially increased 2019 purchases from UTMD in the U.S. and Ireland by $2,407. It seems likely to UTMD that purchases from this customer in 2020 may be at least $700 lower than in 2019 to more closely match its actual growth in demand. UTMD's sales of its niche L&D and gynecology devices excluding the Filshie Clip System are stable, but slow growing. Although the Company remains optimistic about increasing sales of its proven safe and very effective Filshie Clip System for tubal ligation, particularly in the U.S., growth may also be slow as an adjunct from the negative social media that has confused complications of Bayer's Essure tubal ligation device, which was removed from the market, with the Filshie Clip System. In summary, management currently believes overall UTMD year 2020 USD-denominated consolidated revenues are likely to not increase more than low single percentage digits.\n b) Gross Profit (GP). \nUTMD's 2019 consolidated GP, the surplus after subtracting costs of manufacturing, which includes purchasing raw materials, forming components, assembling, inspecting, testing, packaging and sterilizing products, from net revenues, was $29,466 (62.8% of sales) compared to $26,306 in 2018 (62.6% of sales) and $26,395 (63.7% of sales) in 2017. GP in 2019 increased $3,161, which was 64.4% of the $4,906 increase in sales.\nUTMD's expected 2019 GPM increase was damped by the need to sell the remaining Filshie Clip System inventory obtained from CSI as part of UTMD's acquisition of the remaining life of CSI's exclusive U.S. distribution agreement. The CSI inventory was purchased by UTMD at CSI's prior distributor price from Femcare. In other words, the margin received by UTMD from selling the CSI remaining inventory during most of 2019 was limited to the distributor margin, not the margin over the manufacturing cost.\nIn addition, there was a product mix change in 2019 which affected GPMs because OEM sales, which grew faster than other sales categories, have inherently lower GPMs than direct end-user device sales. With OEM sales, another entity incurs operating expenses including sales and marketing (S&M) expenses, as well as much of product development (R&D) and general and administrative (G&A) expenses. In addition to the product mix change, actual raw material price increases and increased freight-in expense from raw material vendors helped damp the GPM. However, fixed manufacturing overhead costs were diluted by higher sales and, despite higher loaded (by benefits and taxes) labor costs, the Company maintained direct labor productivity in 2019 consistent with the prior year.\nBecause UTMD's medical devices are differentiated and not subject to GPO agreements or other significant commodity pricing pressures, the Company was able to avoid unit sales price reductions.\nUTMD's Ireland subsidiary's (UTMD Ltd's) GP was EUR 2,908 in 2019 compared to EUR 3,606 in 2018 and EUR 3,234 in 2017. The associated GPMs were 43.1% in 2019, 49.8% in 2018, and 47.5% in 2017. Despite higher trade sales, the lower GP and GPM in 2019 were due to much lower intercompany sales of Sterishot (Filshie) kits manufactured by UTMD Ltd. due to lower sales in Canada and Australia, and the need to deplete the CSI inventory in the U.S. In addition, the $662 higher China distributor BPM sales, priced at a very low GPM compared to other device sales, were from UTMD Ltd.\nFemcare UK GP was GBP 3,884 in 2019 compared to GBP 5,010 in 2018 and GBP 5,317 in 2017. The lower GP in 2019 was due to the fact that the UK had no sales of Filshie Clip System devices to CSI in 2019 compared to $3,296 in 2018, and had limited intercompany Filshie Clip System device sales to the U.S. because of the need to deplete the CSI inventory. The UK 2019 GPM was 70.2% compared to 71.7% in both 2018 and 2017.\nFemcare Australia and Femcare Canada are purely distribution facilities for UTMD finished devices in their respective countries. Australia GP was AUD 1,415 in 2019, compared to AUD 1,526 in 2018 and AUD 1,846 in 2017. In addition to 5.8% lower AUD sales, Femcare Australia GP were further leveraged lower as a weaker AUD raises the AUD cost of finished devices purchased from other UTMD subsidiaries in their fixed currency terms. The respective Femcare Australia GPMs were 57.7% in 2019, 58.7% in 2018, and 62.7% in 2017. Canada GP was CAD 1,670 in 2019 (54.5% of sales) compared to CAD 1,999 in 2018 (60.0% of sales) and 2,300 (60.2% of sales) in 2017, its first year of operation. The 16% lower GP was due to 16% lower CAD sales in 2019 compared to 2018, UTMD's weakest sales region.\nIn the U.S., GP was $19,180 in 2019, compared to $13,065 in 2018 and $12,497 in 2017. UTMD U.S. GPMs were 57.1% in 2019, 54.1% in 2018, and 55.0% in 2017. Because UTMD in the U.S. grew its trade sales by 36% including direct sales of Filshie Clip System devices, and maintained its intercompany sales of components and finished devices, despite the high growth in lower margin OEM product sales, it was able to increase GP by 47%.\nA summation of the above 2019 GP of each subsidiary will not yield consolidated total GP because of elimination of profit in inventory of intercompany goods. UTMD expects an increase in its consolidated 2020 GPM.\n c) Operating Income. \nOperating Income results from subtracting operating expenses from GP. Operating Income in 2019 was $17,632 (37.6% of sales) compared to $18,697 in 2018 (44.5% of sales), and $19,011 (45.9% of sales) in 2017. The lower 2019 Operating Income margin reflected the new CSI IIA amortization expense (8.6% of sales) included in General and Administrative (G&A) operating expenses. Excluding non-cash Femcare and CSI IIA amortization expenses, UTMD consolidated operating expenses were 12.2% of sales in 2019, compared to 13.0% in 2018 and 12.9% in 2017.\nThe UTMD Ltd (Ireland) Operating Income margin in 2019 was 38.5% compared to 45.9% in 2018, and 42.7% in 2017. Femcare UK's 2019 Operating Income margin was 27.8% compared to 38.1% in 2018, and 40.1% in 2017. Femcare Australia's 2019 Operating Income margin was 38.6% compared to 45.4% in 2018, and 50.0% in 2017. Femcare Canada's 2019 Operating Income margin was 41.9% compared to 49.1% in 2018, and 51.5% in 2017. UTMD's 2019 Operating Income margin in the U.S. was 33.7% compared to 39.1% in 2018, and 39.8% in 2017. The new CSI IIA amortization expense hit the 2019 U.S. Operating Income margin, and the Femcare IIA amortization expense hit the Femcare UK Operating Income margin in years 2017-2019.\nOperating expenses include sales and marketing (S&M) expenses, product development (R&D) expenses and G&A expenses. Consolidated operating expenses were $11,834 (25.2% of sales) in 2019, $7,608 (18.1% of sales) in 2018 and $7,385 (17.8% of sales) in 2017. The following table provides a comparison of operating expense categories, as well as further segmentation of G&A expenses, for the last three years.\n\nDescription of Operating Expense Categories\ni) S&M expenses:\nS&M expenses in 2019 were $1,738 (3.7% of 2019 sales) compared to $1,708 (4.1% of 2018 sales), and $1,544 (3.7% of sales) in 2017.\nS&M expenses are the costs of communicating UTMD's differences and product advantages, providing training and other customer service in support of the use of UTMD's solutions, attending clinical meetings and medical trade shows, administering customer agreements, advertising, processing orders, shipping, and paying commissions to outside independent representatives. In markets where UTMD sells directly to end-users, which in 2017-2019 included the U.S., Ireland, UK, Australia, France and Canada, the largest components of S&M expenses were the cost of employing direct sales representatives, including associated costs of attending trade shows, travel, subsistence and communications; the cost of customer service required to timely process orders; and the distribution costs associated with shipping products. A trade-off for the higher GP obtained from selling directly at end-user prices is higher S&M expenses.\nS&M expenses include all customer support costs including training. In general, training is not required for UTMD's products since they are well-established and have been clinically widely used. Written Instructions For Use\u201d are packaged with all finished devices. Although UTMD does not have any explicit contracts with customers to provide training, it does provide hospital in-service and clinical training as required and reasonably requested.\nUTMD promises prospective customers that it will provide, at no charge in reasonable quantities, electronic media and other instructional materials developed for the use of its products. UTMD provides customer support from offices in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, UK and Australia by telephone to answer user questions and help troubleshoot any user issues. Occasionally, on a case-by-case basis, UTMD may utilize the services of an independent practitioner to provide educational assistance to clinicians. All in-service and training expenses are routinely expensed as they occur. Except for the consulting services of independent practitioners and occasional use of marketing consultants, all of these services are allocated from fixed S&M overhead costs. Historically, additional consulting costs have been immaterial to financial results, which is also UTMD's expectation for the future.\nii) R&D expenses:\nR&D expenses were $483 (1.0% of sales) in 2019 compared to $454 (1.1% of sales) in 2018, and $447 (1.1% of sales) in 2017. R&D expenses include the costs of investigating clinical needs, developing innovative concepts, testing concepts for viability, validating methods of manufacture, completing any necessary premarketing clinical trials, regulatory documentation and other activities required for design control, responding to customer requests for product enhancements, and assisting manufacturing engineering on an ongoing basis in developing new processes or improving existing processes. Although no new UTMD devices were launched in 2019, R&D played a significant and continuing role in manufacturing process improvements that were needed to support fast growing OEM product sales, in addition to continuing work on new product projects. UTMD does not pre-announce new devices that are being developed.\niii) G&A expenses:\nG&A expenses in 2019 were $9,613 (20.5% of sales) compared to $5,447 (13.0% of sales) in 2018 and $5,393 (13.0% of sales) in 2017. G&A expenses include the front office\u201d functional costs of executive management and outside directors, finance and accounting, corporate information systems, human resources, stockholder relations, corporate risk management, corporate governance, protection of intellectual property, amortization of identifiable intangibles and legal costs. The table above helps clarify certain specific categories of G&A expenses of interest to stockholders. Amortization of the 2011 acquired Femcare IIA is part of G&A expenses. Although the IIA GBP amortization expense in 2019 was the same as in 2018, because of the weaker GBP for the year as a whole, the USD 2019 IIA amortization expense was $94 lower than in 2018. The resulting G&A noncash amortization expense of Femcare IIA was 4.3% of total consolidated 2019 sales compared to 5.1% of total 2018 sales, and 5.0% of total sales in 2017. The Femcare IIA amortization expense will continue until March 2026 (or until the value of any remaining IIA becomes impaired).\nThe early 2019 $21,000 purchase of CSI exclusive Filshie Clip System U.S. distribution rights became an IIA which will be amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining life of the Femcare distribution agreement with CSI which was through 3Q 2023. This new IIA amortization expense included in G&A expenses, which began in February 2019, was $4,053 in 2019 (8.6% of total sales). The 2019 new CSI IIA amortization expense exceeded UTMD's increase in GP by $892. In 2020, a full year's CSI IIA amortization expense will be $4,421. In contrast to 2019, as a result of management's projected 2020 increase in GPM, the GP benefit of acquiring the CSI distribution agreement should exceed the IIA amortization expense.\n d) Non-operating income/Non-operating expense, and Earnings Before Taxes (EBT). \nNon-operating income includes royalties from licensing UTMD's technology, rent from leasing underutilized property to others, income earned from investing the Company's excess cash and gains from the sale of assets. Non-operating expense includes interest on bank loans, bank service fees, excise taxes and losses from the sale of assets. Also, the period-to-period remeasured value of EUR cash balances held in the UK, and GBP balances held in Ireland, generates a gain or loss which is booked at reporting period end as non-operating income or expense, as applicable.\nNet non-operating income (combination of non-operating income and non-operating expense) was $252 in 2019 compared to $761 in 2018, and $71 in 2017. The non-operating income in 2018 included a $450 gain from the sales of assets which did not recur in 2019. A description of components of UTMD's non-operating income or expense follows:\n 1) Interest Expense. There was no interest expense in 2017-2019. Absent an acquisition or large repurchase of shares that requires new borrowing, UTMD does not expect any interest expense in 2020. 2) Investment of excess cash. Consolidated investment income (including gains and losses on sales of investments) was $255 in 2019 compared to $248 in 2018, and $17 in 2017. Prior to 2018, cash was generally held in non-interest bearing bank accounts because avoiding the bank operating fees which would result from lower balances offset the low interest that could be earned at then current interest rates. 3) Royalties. Femcare received a royalty from licensing the use of the Filshie Clip System intangibles to CSI as part of its U.S. exclusive distribution agreement. Royalties in 2019 were $5 compared to $76 in 2018, and $86 in 2017. UTMD did not receive a CSI royalty in 2019 after January because of the purchase of the distribution agreement. Presently, there are no other arrangements under which UTMD is receiving royalties from other parties. 4) Gains/ losses from remeasured currency in bank accounts. UTMD recognized a non-operating expense of $76 in 2019 compared to non-operating income of $13 in 2018, and non-operating income of $4 in 2017 from losses or gains on remeasured foreign currency bank balances. EUR and AUD currency cash balances in the UK, and GBP currency cash bank balances in Ireland, are subject to remeasured currency translation gains/ losses as a result of period to period changes in FX rates. Because of UTMD's subsidiaries' profitability, the subsidiaries may continue to accumulate cash until uses of cash that increase stockholder value are identified. 5) Other non-operating income or expense. Income received from renting unused warehouse space in Ireland and parking lot space in Utah for a cell phone tower, offset by bank fees, and other miscellaneous non-operating expenses resulted in a net non-operating expense of $85 in 2019 compared to $3 in 2018 and $36 in 2017. \nEBT results from adding net non-operating income or subtracting net non-operating expense from Operating Income. Consolidated EBT was $17,884 (38.1% of sales) in 2019 compared to $19,458 (46.3% of sales) in 2018, and $19,082 (46.1% of sales) in 2017. The 2019 EBT of UTMD Ltd. (Ireland) was \u20ac2,577 (38.2% of sales) compared to \u20ac3,144 (43.4% of sales) in 2018, and \u20ac2,779 (40.8% of sales) in 2017. Femcare UK's 2019 EBT was \u00a31,566 (28.3% of sales) compared to \u00a32,896 (41.5% of sales) in 2018, and \u00a33,155 (42.5% of sales) in 2017. Femcare AUS's 2019 EBT was AUD 952 (38.8% of sales) compared to AUD 1,183 (45.5% of sales) in 2018, and AUD 1,473 (50.0% of sales) in 2017. Femcare Canada's 2019 EBT was CAD 1,280 (41.8% of sales) compared to CAD 1,632 (49.0% of sales) in 2018, and 1,906 (49.9% of sales) in 2017.\nAs a side note for clarity of financial results, UTMD's 2019, 2018 and 2017 EBT, as well as all other income statement measures above the EBT line in the Income Statements, were unaffected by estimates of the REPAT tax and associated GILTI tax and FDII tax credit, all of which resulted from the TCJA enacted in late 2017.\nEBITDA is a non-US GAAP metric that UTMD management believes is of interest to investors because it provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that represents profitability performance without factoring in effects of financing, accounting decisions regarding non-cash expenses, capital expenditures or tax environments. If the Company were to need to borrow to pay for a major asset or acquisition, the projected EBITDA metric would be of primary interest to a lending institution to determine UTMD's credit worthiness. Although the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission advises that EBITDA is a non-GAAP metric, UTMD's non-US GAAP EBITDA is the sum of the following elements in the table below, each of which is a US GAAP number:\n\nIn summary, UTMD's 2019 non-US GAAP EBITDA grew 10.9% compared to 2018, despite lower EBT. This is indicative of the benefit of UTMD's acquisition of the CSI distribution agreement.\n e) Net Income, Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Return on Equity (ROE). \nNet Income\nNet Income results after subtracting a provision for estimated income taxes from EBT. UTMD's US GAAP Net Income in 2019 was $14,727 (31.4% of sales) compared to $18,555 (44.2% of sales) in 2018, and $8,505 (20.5% of sales) in 2017. Because of changes in tax estimates for the years 2017-2019 due to the TCJA enacted in December 2017, management does not believe either that the estimated tax provisions have a direct relationship to sales in the same periods, or that the year-to-year changes in US GAAP Net Income is indicative of UTMD's financial performance. Ignoring the REPAT and associated TCJA tax adjustments in 2017-2019, 2019 non-US GAAP Net Income was $14,145 (30.2% of sales) compared to 2018 non-US GAAP Net Income of $15,504 (36.9% of sales), and non-US GAAP Net Income of $14,562 (35.2% of sales) in 2017.\nAdding to the difference in 2019 Operating Income compared to 2018, US GAAP Net Income and EPS in 2019 were affected by another change in UTMD's estimate of its State tax liability under the TCJA. Stockholders may recall that UTMD recorded a 3Q 2018 favorable $3,230 adjustment to its initial estimate of the combined Federal and Utah State IRC 965 transition (REPAT) tax recorded in 4Q 2017 financial results, and an unfavorable $129 adjustment in 4Q 2018 for the new Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) tax. The 2018 tax estimate adjustments made to UTMD's income tax provision had a substantial positive impact on U.S. GAAP 2018 Net Income and EPS with which 2019 results are compared. As additional IRS guidance has become available, and the State of Utah's policy for the calculation of its REPAT tax and GILTI tax has become more clear despite lack of published guidance, UTMD's independent tax advisors have recently recommended a further $582 favorable estimate adjustment, which has been recorded in UTMD's 4Q 2019 income tax provision. The adjustment emanates from an updated estimate of the 2017 Utah REPAT tax, application of Utah rules for income apportionment and further clarification of the new Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) regime associated with the GILTI regime as part of the TCJA. In summary, UTMD's initial $6,288 conservative estimate of the combined Federal and State REPAT tax has ended up, after two subsequent adjustments, to only be $2,792. In addition, the new GILTI tax on foreign subsidiary income is more than offset by the FDII tax credit for UTMD's exports of devices manufactured in the U.S. Despite management's initial comments after the TCJA was enacted, the resulting lower income taxes looking forward should be of substantial benefit to stockholders.\nThe US GAAP consolidated income tax provision rate for 2019 was 17.7% of EBT compared to 4.6% of EBT in 2018, and 55.4% of EBT in 2017. The non-US GAAP consolidated combined income tax provision rate for 2019 was 20.9% of EBT compared to 20.3% of EBT in 2018 and 23.7% in 2017. In general, year-to-year fluctuations in the combined tax provision rate will result from variation in EBT contribution from subsidiaries in jurisdictions with different corporate income tax rates. Taxes in foreign subsidiaries are based on taxable EBT in those sovereignties, which can be different from the contribution to consolidated EBT per US GAAP.\nThe UK had an income tax rate of 20% in 1Q 2017 and a rate of 19% thereafter. The UK also allows a tax deduction for sales of UK patented products which varies from year-to-year based on somewhat complicated rules which are sorted out for UTMD by independent UK tax specialists. The 2019 UK income tax rate of 19% is scheduled to decline to 17% beginning April 1, 2020. The income tax rate for AUS has been and is planned to remain at 30%. The income tax rate for Canada was and is expected to remain at about 26%. Profits of the Ireland subsidiary are taxed at a 12.5% rate on exported manufactured products, and a 25% rate on rental and other types of income including income from sales of medical devices in Ireland domestically. As UTMD stockholders likely know, in the U.S. the current Federal income tax rate is 21%, down from 34% prior to the TCJA. Federal taxes are not 21% of U.S. EBT, however, as income taxes paid to the State are a deductible expense for Federal tax purposes, other expenses are not deductible and there remains an R&D tax credit along with other credits, not to mention the new GILTI tax and FDII tax credit. The State income tax rate declined to 4.95% from 5% prior to the TCJA, but the State has enacted new income apportionment rules that provide for additional tax relief, and has its own (not formally published yet) rules for calculating the State REPAT, GILTI and FDII provisions of the TCJA.\nEPS\nEPS are Net Income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding (diluted to take into consideration stock option awards which are in the money,\u201d i.e., have exercise prices below the applicable period's weighted average market value). Diluted EPS in 2019 per US GAAP were $3.939 ($3.784 prior to the State REPAT tax correction) compared to $4.950 ($4.136 prior to the REPAT tax correction and GILTI tax provision) in 2018, and $2.276 in 2017 ($3.897 prior to the REPAT tax and DTL adjustment). The 2019 non-US GAAP EPS result met management's projection at the beginning of the year.\nThe 2019-ending weighted average number of diluted common shares (the number used to calculate diluted EPS) was 3,739 (in thousands) compared to 3,749 in 2018, and 3,737 shares in 2017. Dilution for in the money\u201d unexercised options for the year 2019 was 18 (in thousands) compared to18 shares in 2018, and 19 shares in 2017. Actual outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2019 were 3,722.\nUTMD management believes that the presentation of Net Income and EPS results excluding the REPAT tax liability estimate in 2017 and adjustments in 2018 and 2019 provides meaningful supplemental information to both management and investors that is more clearly indicative of UTMD's bottom line results in comparing 2019 to the prior years 2018 and 2017. Net Income and EPS are presented below both according to GAAP and also prior to recognition of various tax estimates related to the TCJA.\nUS GAAP:\n\nNon-US GAAP (excluding TCJA REPAT tax in 2017 and adjustments in 2018 and 2019):\n\nNote: The tax provision adjustments only affected UTMD's income tax provision, Net Income and EPS, not consolidated revenues (sales), GP, Operating Income or EBT.\nThe Company believes that investors benefit from referring to the non-US GAAP financial measures above in assessing UTMD's performance. The non-US GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons for purposes of planning future performance. The non-US GAAP financial measures disclosed by UTMD should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated.\nTo summarize 2019 financial results, UTMD achieved substantial growth in domestic revenues, but due to the strength of the USD, realized lower USD-denominated sales and demand OUS. Although GP grew consistent with sales, UTMD's GPM did not expand as much as expected to cover the new IIA amortization expense associated with the acquisition of the exclusive U.S. distribution rights for the Filshie Clip System from CSI. As a result, Operating Income was 5.7% lower than in 2018 despite continued excellent management of operating expenses. Without the same non-operating income benefit of asset sales in 2018, UTMD's 2019 non-US GAAP Net Income (ignoring tax estimate changes in both 2019 and 2018) declined 8.8% and non-US GAAP EPS declined 8.5% because of slightly lower diluted shares outstanding. Net Income and EPS met management's projections provided to stockholders at the beginning of the year (excluding the favorable income tax provision estimate adjustments).\nLooking forward, because of the lack of predictability of UTMD's largest OEM customer's demand, the variability of FX rates affecting UTMD's foreign currency sales not to mention OUS distributor demand patterns, and expected slower growth in Filshie Clip System demand, management conservatively projects 2020 consolidated sales about the same as in 2019. An expected higher GPM, however, should fuel UTMD's continued growth in its non-US GAAP EBITDA metric. In a U.S. presidential election year, considering the rhetoric of leading candidates, that's about as specific as the Company can be in projecting the future.\nROE\nMaintaining a high ROE is a key management objective for UTMD in order to grow without diluting stockholder interest. ROE is the quotient of Net Income divided by average Stockholders' Equity, but more specifically it is the product of the Net Income margin, productivity of assets and financial leverage. Although UTMD's high Net Income margin is the primary factor that continues to drive its ROE, cash dividends to stockholders and repurchase of shares help in lowering average Stockholders' Equity, reducing the denominator in calculating ROE. Before dividends, UTMD's 2019 ROE was 14.9% compared to 18.6% in 2018, and 19.8% in 2017 excluding the effect of the tax adjustments on Net Income associated with the TCJA. The lower 2019 ROE was the result of 8.8% lower non-US GAAP NI and 13.7% higher average Stockholders' Equity.\nBecause of its magnitude, the REPAT tax estimate in 2017, and estimate adjustments in both 2018 and 2019, had a significant impact on the overall ROE ratios, even though the REPAT tax amounts reduce both the numerator and denominator. UTMD's 2019 ROE before stockholder dividends (with US GAAP Net Income) was 15.5%. In comparison, 2018 ROE was 22.2%, and 2017 ROE was 4.6% with US GAAP Net Income. Because of the impact on Net Income from the over-estimate of the REPAT tax in 2017 and the corrections in 2018 and 2019, stockholders might consider that the average ROE of 14% is more indicative of results in all three years. Average Stockholders' Equity was $95,042 in 2019 compared to $83,557 in 2018, and $73,683 in 2017. Maintaining a high ROE with the dilutive effect of rapidly growing Average Stockholders' Equity (despite reductions from dividends and stock repurchases) suggests an excellent increase in stockholder value.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows.\nNet cash provided by operating activities, including adjustments for depreciation and other non-cash operating expenses, along with changes in working capital and the tax benefit attributable to exercise of employee incentive stock options, totaled $17,056 in 2019 compared to $16,834 in 2018, and $16,908 in 2017. Changes in 2019 changes in cash from operating activities compared to 2018 changes (second order derivative) were largely related to the REPAT tax and acquisition of the CSI distribution rights: 1) largely with regard to the REPAT tax, $3,827 smaller US GAAP net income, a $2,397 smaller adjustment reduction to the long term REPAT tax payable, and a $1,093 larger decrease in accrued liabilities (taxes payable); and 2) largely with regard to the CSI acquisition, a $3,953 increase in non-cash amortization expense, a $1,442 larger increase in inventories and a $242 larger increase in accounts receivable. In addition, in 2019 UTMD realized a $457 smaller gain on disposal of assets including investments compared to 2018. Other changes were generally consistent with prior year changes relative to effective working capital management and sales activity.\nIn investing activities, during 2019 UTMD used $540 to purchase new molds and manufacturing equipment to maintain and improve operating capabilities, compared to using $402 for that purpose in 2018. Also in 2019, UTMD used $21,000 to purchase the remaining life of CSI's exclusive U.S. distribution rights for the Filshie Clip System.\nIn 2019 UTMD received $283 and issued 7,042 shares of stock upon the exercise of employee and director stock options. Employees and directors exercised a total of 7,110 option shares in 2019, with 68 shares immediately being retired as a result of optionees trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options. Option exercises in 2019 were at an average price of $40.80 per share. The Company received a $23 tax benefit from option exercises in 2019, which is reflected in net income as a result of adopting a new accounting standard in 2017. UTMD repurchased 5,000 shares of its stock in the open market during 2019 at an average cost of $79.52 per share.\nIn comparison, in 2018 UTMD received $454 and issued 13,283 shares of stock upon the exercise of employee and director stock options. Employees and directors exercised a total of 15,722 option shares in 2018, with 2,439 shares immediately being retired as a result of optionees trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options. Option exercises in 2018 were at an average price of $43.22 per share. The Company received a $49 tax benefit from option exercises in 2018, which is reflected in net income as a result of adopting a new accounting standard in 2017. UTMD repurchased 15,000 shares of its stock in the open market during 2018 at an average cost of $80.35 per share.\nIn 2017 UTMD received $302 and issued 8,302 shares of stock upon the exercise of employee and director stock options. Employees and directors exercised a total of 8,638 option shares in 2017, with 336 shares immediately being retired as a result of optionees trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options. Option exercises in 2017 were at an average price of $37.83 per share. The Company received a $38 tax benefit from option exercises in 2017, which is reflected in net income as a result of adopting a new accounting standard in 2017. UTMD did not repurchase any shares of its stock in the open market during 2017.\nUTMD did not borrow in any of the three years 2017-2019. Cash dividends paid to stockholders were $4,112 in 2019 compared to $4,026 in 2018, and $2,955 in 2017. The $1,005 cash dividend declared for 4Q 2017 was paid in early January 2018, a change from the dividend declared in 4Q 2016, which was paid in late December 2016.\nManagement believes that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to finance internal growth plans. In an uncertain economic environment, UTMD's cash balances allow management to operate with the long-term best interest of stockholders in mind. Planned 2020 capital expenditures for ongoing operations are expected to be more than depreciation of PP&E, primarily because the Midvale facility will receive a new roof costing about $300 with an expected 15-year useful life.\nManagement plans to utilize cash not needed to support normal operations in one or a combination of the following: 1) in general, to continue to invest at opportune times in ways that will enhance future profitability; 2) to make additional investments in new technology and/or processes; and/or 3) to acquire a product line or company that will augment revenue and EPS growth and better utilize UTMD's existing infrastructure. If there are no better strategic uses for UTMD's cash, the Company will continue to return cash to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases when the stock appears undervalued.\nManagement's Outlook.\nUTMD is small, but its employees are experienced and remain diligent in their work. UTMD's passion is in providing differentiated clinical solutions that will help improve the effectiveness of medical procedures and reduce health risks, particularly for women and their babies.\nThe safety, reliability and performance of UTMD's medical devices are high and represent significant clinical benefits while providing minimum total cost of care. UTMD will continue to leverage its reputation as a device innovator which will responsively take on challenges to work with clinicians who use its specialty devices. In doing so, UTMD will continue to differentiate itself, especially from commodity-oriented competitors. In 2020, UTMD again plans to\n 1) exploit distribution and manufacturing synergies by further integrating capabilities and resources in its multinational operations; 2) focus on effectively direct marketing the benefits of the Filshie Clip System in the U.S.; 3) introduce additional products helpful to clinicians through internal new product development; 4) continue to achieve excellent overall financial operating performance; 5) utilize positive cash generation to continue providing cash dividends to stockholders and make open market share repurchases if/when the UTMD share price seems undervalued; and 6) be vigilant for accretive acquisition opportunities which may be brought about by difficult burdens on small, innovative companies. \nThe Company has a fundamental focus to do an excellent job in meeting clinicians' and patients' needs, while providing stockholders with excellent returns. In 2019, the value of UTMD's stock increased 30%, ending the year at $107.90/ share, while $1.10 in cash dividends/ share were paid. In comparison, the DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ indices were up 22%, 29% and 35% respectively in 2019.\nTaking a longer term view, as of the end of 2019 from the end of 1998, UTMD's share price increased 1,544%, representing a 14.3% annually compounded share price increase over the twenty-one year time span. If additional returns to stockholders from cash dividends are added, stockholder value increased 1,780% over the twenty-one year time span, representing 15.0% annually compounded growth in value. In comparison to UTMD's 1,544% increase in stock value over the past twenty-one years, the NASDAQ Composite Index was up 309%, the S&P 500 Index was up 163% and the DJIA was up 211%.\nCombining share price appreciation as a result of a long term profitable financial performance and a capital allocation strategy that includes opportunistic share repurchases with steadily growing quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders since 2004, longer term UTMD stockholders have experienced excellent returns. Management is committed to continue that performance.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of UTMD's significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019:\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nManagement bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. This forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Management has identified the following as the Company's most critical accounting policies which require significant judgment and estimates. Although management believes its estimates are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n \u2022 Allowance for doubtful accounts: The majority of the Company's receivables are with healthcare facilities and medical device distributors. Although the Company has historically not had significant write-offs of bad debt, the possibility exists, particularly with foreign distributors where collection efforts can be difficult or in the event of widespread hospital bankruptcies. \u2022 Inventory valuation reserves: The Company strives to maintain inventory to 1) meet its customers' needs and 2) optimize manufacturing lot sizes while 3) not tying-up an unnecessary amount of the Company's capital increasing the possibility of, among other things, obsolescence. The Company believes its method of reviewing actual and projected demand for its existing inventory allows it to arrive at a fair inventory valuation reserve. While the Company has historically not had significant inventory write-offs, the possibility exists that one or more of its products may become unexpectedly obsolete for which a reserve has not previously been created. The Company's historical write-offs have not been materially different from its estimates. \nAccounting Policy Changes\nThe Company's management has evaluated the recently issued accounting pronouncements through the filing date of these financial statements and has determined that the application of these pronouncements will not have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.", "item_7_tables": "Table 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td>
