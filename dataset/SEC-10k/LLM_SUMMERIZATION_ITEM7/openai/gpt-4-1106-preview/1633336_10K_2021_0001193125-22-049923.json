MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in \u201cITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. In this report, \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and \u201cCompany\u201d refer to Crescent Capital BDC, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 5, 2015 and on January 30, 2020, we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Delaware to the State of Maryland. We were listed and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange on February 3, 2020. We have elected to be treated as a business development company (\u201cBDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d). In addition, we have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (a \u201cRIC\u201d) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). As such, we are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in \u201cqualifying assets,\u201d source of income limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income and tax-exempt interest.\nWe are managed by Crescent Cap Advisors, LLC (the \u201cAdviser\u201d), an investment adviser that is registered with the SEC under the 1940 Act. CCAP Administration, LLC (the \u201cAdministrator\u201d), provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. Our management consists of investment and administrative professionals from the Adviser and Administrator along with our Board. The Adviser directs and executes our investment operations and capital raising activities subject to oversight from the Board, which sets our broad policies. The Board has delegated investment management of our investment assets to the Adviser. The Board consists of five directors, four of whom are independent.\nOur investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments. We invest primarily in secured debt (including first lien, unitranche first lien and second-lien debt) and unsecured debt (including mezzanine and subordinated debt), as well as related equity securities of private U.S. middle-market companies. We may purchase interests in loans or make debt investments, either (i) directly from our target companies as primary market or private credit investments (i.e., private credit transactions), or (ii) primary or secondary market bank loan or high yield transactions in the broadly syndicated \u201cover-the-counter\u201d market (i.e., broadly syndicated loans and bonds). Although our focus is to invest in less liquid private credit transactions, we may from time to time invest in more liquid broadly syndicated loans to complement our private credit transactions.\n\u201cFirst lien\u201d investments are senior loans on a lien basis to other liabilities in the issuer's capital structure that have the benefit of a first-priority security interest in assets of the issuer. The security interest ranks above the security interest of any second-lien lenders in those assets.\n\u201cUnitranche first lien\u201d investments are loans that may extend deeper in a company's capital structure than traditional first lien debt and may provide for a waterfall of cash flow priority among different lenders in the unitranche loan. In certain instances, we may find another lender to provide the \u201cfirst out\u201d portion of such loan and retain the \u201clast out\u201d portion of such loan, in which case, the \u201cfirst out\u201d portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder over the \u201clast out\u201d portion that we would continue to hold. In exchange for the greater risk of loss, the \u201clast out\u201d portion earns a higher interest rate.\n\u201cSecond lien\u201d investments are loans with a second priority lien on all existing and future assets of the portfolio company. The security interest ranks below the security interests of any first lien and unitranche first lien lenders in those assets.\n\u201cUnsecured debt\u201d investments are loans that generally rank senior to a borrower's equity securities and junior in right of payment to such borrower's other senior indebtedness.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed herein. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Valuation of Portfolio Investments, Revenue Recognition, Non-Accrual Investments, Distribution Policy, and Income Taxes.\nIn addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment Valuation\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider our principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in the determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:\nLevel 1-Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.\nLevel 2-Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3-Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our Audit Committee and, with certain de minimis exceptions, independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board.\nThe Board oversees and supervises a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> The valuation process begins with each investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the portfolio management team.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> The Adviser's management and Crescent's alternative investment valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuations with the investment professionals. Agreed upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> The Audit Committee reviews the valuations presented and recommends values for each investment to the Board.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Investments in investment companies are valued at fair value. Fair values are generally determined utilizing the net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) supplied by, or on behalf of, management of each investment company, which is net of management and incentive fees or allocations charged by the investment company and is in accordance with the \u201cpractical expedient\u201d, as defined by ASC 820. NAVs received by, or on behalf of, management of each investment company are based on the fair value of the investment company's underlying investments in accordance with policies established by management of each investment company, as described in each of their financial statements and offering memorandum. Investments which are valued using NAV as a practical expedient are excluded from the above hierarchy.\nWe apply the valuation policy approved by the Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which its investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When a security is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for classification as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we review pricing methodologies provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Some additional factors considered include the number of prices obtained as well as an assessment as to their quality. Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the period in which the transfers occur.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different from the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein.\nInterest and Dividend Income Recognition\nInterest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the amortization of purchase discounts and premiums. Discounts and premiums to par value are accreted or amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion and amortization of discounts and premiums, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income.\nDividend income from common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies. Dividend income from preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Each distribution received from an equity investment is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments as dividend income unless there is sufficient current or accumulated earnings prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nCertain investments have contractual payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the loan principal or cost basis of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest income, as applicable. If at any point we believe PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. Accrued PIK interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest or dividend income, respectively, when an investment is placed on non-accrual status.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code. So long as we maintain the status as a RIC, we will generally not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our stockholders as dividends. As a result, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our stockholders and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. We account for income taxes in conformity with ASC 740 - Income Taxes (\u201cASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 provides guidelines for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in financial statements.\nIn order for us not to be subject to federal excise taxes, we must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of our ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections), (ii) 98.2% of our net capital gains from the current year and (iii) any undistributed ordinary income and net capital gains from preceding years. We, at our discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4% excise tax on this income. If we choose to do so, this generally would increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to stockholders. We accrue excise tax on estimated undistributed taxable income as required on a quarterly basis.\nCBDC Universal Equity, Inc. is a taxable entity (\u201cTaxable Subsidiary\u201d). The Taxable Subsidiary permits us to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are \u201cpass through\u201d entities for tax purposes and continue to comply with the \u201csource income\u201d requirements contained in RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiary is not consolidated with us for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe intend to comply with the applicable provisions of the Code, pertaining to regulated investment companies and to make distributions of taxable income sufficient to relieve it from substantially all federal income taxes. As of December 31, 2021, we are subject to examination by U.S. federal tax authorities for returns filed for the three most recent calendar years and by state tax authorities for returns filed for the four most recent calendar years.\nWe may generate qualified net interest income or qualified net short-term capital gains that may be exempt from U.S. withholding tax when distributed to foreign stockholders. A RIC is permitted to designate distributions of qualified net interest income and qualified short-term capital gains as exempt from U.S. withholding tax when paid to non-U.S. shareholders with proper documentation. As of December 31, 2021, the percentage of 2021 income estimated as qualified interest income for tax purposes was 86.7%\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2020-04, \u201cReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\u201d and in January 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2021-01 (\u201cASU 2021-01\u201d) \u201cReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope. This ASU provides optional exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions affected reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. ASU 2020-04 and 2021-01 are elective and can be adopted between March 12, 2020 and December 31, 2022. This guidance has no material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nCOMPONENTS OF OPERATIONS\nInvestments\nWe expect our investment activity to vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us, the level of merger and acquisition activity for middle-market companies, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to such companies and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. In addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce certain levels of investments through partial sales or syndication to additional investors.\nWe may not invest in any assets other than \u201cqualifying assets\u201d specified in the 1940 Act, unless, at the time the investments are made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in \u201celigible portfolio companies.\u201d Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, \u201celigible portfolio companies\u201d include certain companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than $250 million.\nThe Investment Adviser\nOur investment activities are managed by the Adviser, which is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser has entered into a resource sharing agreement with Crescent Capital Group LP (\u201cCrescent\u201d), pursuant to which Crescent provides the Adviser with experienced investment professionals (including the members of the Adviser's investment committee) and access to Crescent's resources so as to enable the Adviser to fulfill its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Through the resource sharing agreement, the Adviser intends to capitalize on the deal origination, credit underwriting, due diligence, investment structuring, execution, portfolio management and monitoring experience of Crescent's investment professionals. On January 5, 2021, Sun Life Financial Inc. (together with its subsidiaries and joint ventures, \u201cSun Life\u201d) acquired a majority interest in Crescent (the \u201cSun Life Transaction\u201d). There were no changes to our investment objective, strategies and process or to the Crescent team responsible for the investment operations as a result of the Sun Life Transaction.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments, capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Certain investments may have contractual PIK interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the loan principal of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable. We also generate revenue in the form of commitment or origination fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts into income over the life of the loan using the effective yield method.\nDividend income from common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies. Dividend income from preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected.\nWe may receive other income, which may include income such as consent, waiver, amendment, underwriting, and arranger fees associated with our investment activities as well as any fees for managerial assistance services rendered to the portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of management fees and incentive fees to the Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, as amended, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the administration agreement with our Administrator (the \u201cAdministration Agreement\u201d), operating costs associated with our third party sub-administrator and other operating costs described below. The management and incentive fees compensate the Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> fidelity bond, directors' and officers' liability insurance and other insurance premiums;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> independent directors' fees and expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, rent and the allocable portion of the cost of certain professional services provided to us, including but not limited to, our accounting professionals, our legal counsel and compliance professionals);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> U.S. federal, state and local taxes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> fees payable to third parties relating to making investments, including out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> federal and state registration fees and any stock exchange listing fees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> brokerage commissions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and other applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines.\nLeverage\nOur financing facilities allow us to borrow money and lever our investment portfolio, subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, with the objective of increasing our yield. This is known as \u201cleverage\u201d and could increase or decrease returns to our stockholders. The use of leverage involves significant risks.\nIn accordance with applicable SEC staff guidance and interpretations, effective May 5, 2020 with shareholder approval, we, as a BDC, are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio is at least 150% after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met), rather than 200%, as previously required. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. The amount of leverage that we employ depends on our Adviser's and our Board's assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.\nPORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nWe seek to create a broad and diversified portfolio that generally includes senior secured first lien, unitranche, senior secured second lien, unsecured loans and minority equity securities of U.S. middle market companies. The size of our individual investments varies proportionately with the size of our capital base. We generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities have speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal.

Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had five investments across three portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which represented 1.6% and 1.2% of the total debt investments at cost and fair value, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had three investments across two portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which represented 1.7% and 1.3% of the total debt investments at cost and fair value, respectively. The remaining debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:\nTable 210: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> comparisons to other companies in the industry; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table> <tr> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> attendance and participation in board meetings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories:\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>1 </td> <td> Involves the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The investment/borrower is performing above expectations since investment, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may include the financial performance of the borrower or a potential exit.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td>2 </td> <td> Involves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of investment. The investment/borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td>3 </td> <td> Involves an investment/borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the investment's risk has increased somewhat since investment. The borrower's loan payments are generally not past due and more likely than not the borrower will remain in compliance with debt covenants. An investment rating of 3 requires closer monitoring.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td>4 </td> <td> Involves an investment/borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has increased materially since investment. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due). Placing loans on non-accrual status should be considered for investments rated 4.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>5 </td> <td> Involves an investment/borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has substantially increased since investment. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and the fair market values of the loans are generally reduced to the anticipated recovery amounts. Loans with an investment rating of 5 are generally placed on non-accrual status.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the composition of our portfolio on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale.

Included in interest from investments for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are $8.0 million and $2.3 million of accelerated accretion of OID, respectively.\nDividend income increased from $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to one-time dividend distributions from certain portfolio companies. Other income which includes consent, waiver, amendment, agency, underwriting and arranger fees associated with our investment activities decreased from $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nExpenses\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $ in millions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other debt financing costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income based incentive fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital gains based incentive fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directors' fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fee waiver\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.7 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income based incentive fees waiver\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income and excise taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Interest and other debt financing costs\nInterest and other debt financing costs include interest, amortization of deferred financing costs including upfront commitment fees and unused fees on our credit facilities. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 interest and other debt financing costs were $19.8 million and $15.5 million, respectively. The increase was due to a higher weighted average debt outstanding and acceleration of the amortization of certain deferred financing costs in conjunction with the termination of a credit facility in 2021.\nBase Management Fees\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred management fees of $14.1 million and $11.4 million, of which $3.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively, were waived. The increase in net management fees was driven by growing assets under management and expiration of the management fee waiver on July 31, 2021.\nIncentive Fees\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we incurred income based incentive fees of $9.8 million and $8.6 million, of which $7.5 million and $8.6 million, respectively, were waived. The increase in income based incentive fees was driven by expiration of the income based incentive fee waiver on July 31, 2021.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we accrued $6.3 million and $0, respectively, of capital gains based incentive fees. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $6.3 million and $0, respectively, was accrued and unpaid. The increase in incentive fees on cumulative unrealized capital appreciation was attributable to the inception to date performance of the investment portfolio.\nProfessional Fees and Other General and Administrative Expenses\nProfessional fees generally include expenses from independent auditors, tax advisors, legal counsel and third party valuation agents. Other general and administrative expenses generally include overhead and staffing costs allocated from the Administrator, insurance premiums, third party sub-administrator expenses and miscellaneous administrative costs associated with our operations and investment activity.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, professional fees were $1.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, other general and administrative expenses were $2.6 million, respectively.\nThe cumulative increase in professional fees and other general and administrative expenses was attributable to servicing a growing investment portfolio.\nIncome and Excise Taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we expensed income and excise taxes of $2.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The increase in income and excise tax was attributable to $1.7 million of income tax due on flow through taxable income from equity investments held in a blocker. Allocated flow through taxable income is typically offset by tax distributions, which are recorded under dividend income.\nNet Investment Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, GAAP net investment income was $47.6 million or $1.67 per share and $49.9 million or $1.80 per share, respectively. The decrease was due to accrued capital gains based incentive fees recorded during current year.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, net investment income excluding capital gains incentive fees (\u201cAdjusted Net Investment Income\u201d) was $53.9 million or $1.89 per share and $49.9 million or $1.80 per share, respectively. The increase was due to a higher investment income from a growing investment portfolio and higher accelerated amortization income.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net investment income (the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to Adjusted Net Investment Income for the periods presented:\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the years ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Per Share </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Per Share </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP net investment income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.80 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital gains based incentive fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted Net Investment Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.80 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> On a supplemental basis, we are disclosing Adjusted Net Investment Income and per share Adjusted Net Investment Income, each of which is a financial measure that is calculated and presented on a basis of methodology other than in accordance with U.S. GAAP (\u201cnon-GAAP\u201d). Adjusted Net Investment Income represents net investment income, excluding capital gains incentive fees. We use this non-GAAP financial measure internally to analyze and evaluate financial results and performance and believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends without giving effect to capital gains incentive fees. Our investment advisory agreement provides that a capital gains-based incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to realized capital gains (but not unrealized capital appreciation) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis. We believe that Adjusted Net Investment Income is a useful performance measure because it reflects the net investment income produced on our investments during a period\nwithout giving effect to any changes in the value of such investments and any related capital gains incentive fees between periods. The presentation of Adjusted Net Investment Income is not intended to be a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\nWe value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. Net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investment portfolio were comprised of the following:\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

credit or other risks. Generally, we do not intend to enter into any such derivative agreements for speculative purposes. Any derivative agreements entered into for speculative purposes are not expected to be material to our business or results of operations. These hedging activities, which are in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, may include the use of various instruments, including futures, options and forward contracts. We bear the costs incurred in connection with entering into, administering and settling any such derivative contracts. There can be no assurance any hedging strategy we employ will be successful.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our average U.S. Dollar notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts were $61.5 million and $35.8 million, respectively.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are for (1) investments in portfolio companies and other investments; (2) the cost of operations (including paying the Adviser); (3) debt service, repayment, and other financing costs; and (4) cash distributions to the holders of our common stock. We expect to generate additional liquidity from (1) future offerings of securities, (2) future borrowings and (3) cash flows from operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $23.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents and $197.0 million of undrawn capacity on our senior revolving credit and special purpose vehicle asset facilities, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. As of December 31, 2021, the undrawn capacity under our facilities is in excess of our unfunded commitments.\nWe believe that there is sufficient assets and liquidity to adequately cover future obligations under unfunded commitments. The cash and restricted cash balances, availability under the credit facilities and ongoing investment realizations are expected to provide sufficient liquidity. In addition, broadly syndicated loans in the portfolio could be sold over a relatively short period to generate liquidity. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with our asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act. In addition, we were in compliance with all the financial covenant requirements of our credit facilities as of December 31, 2021. However, any increase in realized losses or unrealized depreciation of our investment portfolio or significant reductions in our net asset value as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, increase the risk of breaching the relevant covenants requirements. Any breach of these requirements may adversely affect the access to sufficient debt and equity capital.\nCapital Share Activity\nBetween June 26, 2015, commencement of operations, and January 31, 2020, the date of Alcentra Acquisition, we entered into subscription agreements (collectively, the \u201cSubscription Agreements\u201d) with several investors, including Crescent, providing for the private placement of our common shares. Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, between June 26, 2015 and January 31, 2020, we issued 23,127,335 common shares for aggregate proceeds of $456.3 million, of which $10.0 million was from Crescent. Proceeds from the issuances were used to fund our investing activities and for other general corporate purposes. Subsequently, on January 31, 2020, we issued 5,203,016 shares in connection with the Alcentra Acquisition. Upon closing of the Alcentra Acquisition, all unfunded commitments of stockholders subscribing in the private offering were terminated.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 30,128 shares of our common stock to investors in connection with our dividend reinvestment plan for proceeds of $0.6 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021 we issued 2,720,000 shares of our common stock for total proceeds of $58.0 million in connection with the equity offering on November 18, 2021.\nDebt\nDebt consisted of the following:\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td>

loan and security agreement, as amended from time to time (the \u201cSPV Asset Facility\u201d) with us as the collateral manager, seller and equity holder, CCAP SPV as the borrower, the banks and other financial institutions from time to time party thereto as lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d), as administrative agent, collateral agent, and lender. We consolidate CCAP SPV in our consolidated financial statements and no gain or loss is recognized from the transfer of assets to and from CCAP SPV.\nThe maximum commitment amount under the SPV Asset Facility is $350.0 million, and may be increased with the consent of Wells Fargo or reduced upon our request. Proceeds of the advances under the SPV Asset Facility may be used to acquire portfolio investments, to make distributions to us in accordance with the SPV Asset Facility, and to pay related expenses. The maturity date is the earlier of (a) the date the borrower voluntarily reduces the commitments to zero, (b) June 22, 2026 and (c) the date upon which Wells Fargo declares the obligations due and payable after the occurrence of an Event of Default. Borrowings under the SPV Asset Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin with no LIBOR floor. The margin is between 1.65% and 2.10% as determined by the proportion of liquid and illiquid loans pledged to the SPV Asset Facility. We generally pay unused facility fees of 0.50% per annum on committed but undrawn amounts under the SPV Asset Facility. The unused facility fee rate may vary based on the utilization. The SPV Asset Facility includes customary covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, as well as usual and customary events of default for revolving credit facilities of this nature.\nThe facility size is subject to availability under the borrowing base, which is based on the amount of CCAP SPV's assets from time to time, and satisfaction of certain conditions, including an asset coverage test and certain concentration limits.\nSMBC Corporate Revolving Facility\nOn October 27, 2021, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and Lender (the \u201cSMBC Corporate Revolving Facility\u201d). The maximum principal amount of the SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility is $300.0 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base. Borrowings under the SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.875% or 2.000%, subject to certain provisions in the SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility agreement, with no LIBOR floor. Any amounts borrowed under the SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility, and all accrued and unpaid interest, will be due and payable, on October 27, 2026\nAlly Corporate Revolving Facility\nOn August 20, 2019, we entered into the \u201cAlly Corporate Revolving Facility\u201d with Ally Bank, as Administrative Agent and Arranger. The maximum principal amount of the Ally Corporate Revolving Facility was $200.0 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base. Borrowings under the Ally Corporate Revolving Facility bore interest at LIBOR plus a 2.35% margin with no LIBOR floor.\nWe terminated the Ally Corporate Revolving Facility concurrent with the closing of the SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility, on October 27, 2021.\nUnsecured Notes\nOn July 30, 2020, we completed a private offering of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.95% senior unsecured notes due July 30, 2023 (the \u201c2023 Unsecured Notes\u201d). The 2023 Unsecured Notes were issued in two $25.0 million issuances on July 30, 2020 and October 28, 2020.\nThe 2023 Unsecured Notes will mature on July 30, 2023 and may be redeemed in whole or in part, at our option, at par plus a \u201cmake-whole\u201d premium, if applicable. Interest on the 2023 Unsecured Notes is due and payable semiannually in arrears on January 30 and July 30 of each year. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the terms of the note purchase agreement governing the 2023 Unsecured Notes.\n2026 Unsecured Notes\nOn February 17, 2021, we completed a private offering of $135.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured notes due February 17, 2026 (the \u201c2026 Unsecured Notes\u201d). The initial issuance of $50.0 of 2026 Unsecured Notes closed February 17, 2021. The issuance of the remaining $85.0 of 2026 Unsecured Notes closed on May 5, 2021.\nThe 2026 Unsecured Notes will mature on February 17, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part, at our option, at par plus a \u201cmake-whole\u201d premium, if applicable. Interest on the 2026 Unsecured Notes is due and payable semiannually in arrears on February 17 and August 17 of each year. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the terms of the note purchase agreement governing the 2026 Unsecured Notes.\nInterNotes\u00ae\nOn January 31, 2020, in connection with the Alcentra Acquisition, we assumed direct unsecured fixed interest rate obligations or \u201cInterNotes\u00ae\u201d. The InterNotes\u00ae bore interest at fixed interest rates ranging between 6.25% and 6.75% and offered a variety of maturities ranging between February 15, 2021 and April 15, 2022. We redeemed or paid down the remaining $16.4 million of InterNotes\u00ae during the first quarter of 2021.\nThe summary of costs incurred in connection with the SPV Asset Facility, SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility, Ally Corporate Revolving Facility, 2023 Unsecured Notes, 2026 Unsecured Notes and InterNotes\u00ae is presented below:\n$ in millions\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowing interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unused facility fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of financing costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest and credit facility expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average outstanding balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>530.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>421.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> To the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced opportunities, or if our Board otherwise determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interest and the best interests of our stockholders, we may enter into new debt financing opportunities in addition to our existing debt. The pricing and other terms of any such opportunities would depend upon market conditions and the performance of our business, among other factors.\nIn accordance with applicable SEC staff guidance and interpretations, effective May 5, 2020 with shareholder approval, we, as a BDC, are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio is at least 150% after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met), rather than 200%, as previously required. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. The amount of leverage that we employ depends on our Adviser's and our Board's assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our asset coverage ratio was 201% and 217%, respectively. We may also refinance or repay any of our indebtedness at any time based on our financial condition and market conditions. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for more detail on the debt facilities.\nSTOCK PURCHASE AND REPURCHASE PROGRAMS\nCCAP Repurchase Program\nOn January 31, 2020, we entered into a $20.0 million repurchase plan which allowed us to purchase shares in the open market any time our common stock traded below 90% of the most recently disclosed net asset value per share. The plan was subject to compliance with our liquidity, covenant, leverage and regulatory requirements. Pursuant to the terms of the repurchase plan, repurchases began on March 2, 2020. On April 9, 2020, our Board of Directors unanimously approved the termination of the stock repurchase program.\nThere was no stock repurchased for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 192,415 shares at an average price per share, including commissions, of $11.48.\nSun Life Purchase Program\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Sun Life Financial Inc., the majority owner of Crescent, our investment advisor, commenced two $10.0 million stock purchase plans to make open-market purchases of shares of our common stock. The purchases were conducted in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and other applicable securities laws and regulations that set certain restrictions on the method, timing, price, and volume of stock purchases. Below is the summary of share purchases made. The first plan was completed on October 15, 2021. No purchase plans were in place for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(in $ millions, except for per share amounts)\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dollar amount purchased\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Shares purchased\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>664,014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average price per share (inclusive of commissions paid)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.87 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Employees and Affiliates Purchase Program\nAn entity owned by certain officers of Crescent Capital BDC, Inc. and employees and affiliates of Crescent commenced multiple stock purchase plans to make open-market purchases of shares of our common stock.

Unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the on-balance sheet financial instruments that we hold. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had aggregate unfunded commitments totaling $196.7 million and $80.8 million, respectively.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nOn February 18, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.41 per share, which will be paid on April 15, 2022 to stockholders of record as of March 31, 2022.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in \u201cITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. In this report, \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and \u201cCompany\u201d refer to Crescent Capital BDC, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 5, 2015 and on January 30, 2020, we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Delaware to the State of Maryland. We were listed and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange on February 3, 2020. We have elected to be treated as a business development company (\u201cBDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d). In addition, we have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (a \u201cRIC\u201d) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). As such, we are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in \u201cqualifying assets,\u201d source of income limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income and tax-exempt interest.\nWe are managed by Crescent Cap Advisors, LLC (the \u201cAdviser\u201d), an investment adviser that is registered with the SEC under the 1940 Act. CCAP Administration, LLC (the \u201cAdministrator\u201d), provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. Our management consists of investment and administrative professionals from the Adviser and Administrator along with our Board. The Adviser directs and executes our investment operations and capital raising activities subject to oversight from the Board, which sets our broad policies. The Board has delegated investment management of our investment assets to the Adviser. The Board consists of five directors, four of whom are independent.\nOur investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments. We invest primarily in secured debt (including first lien, unitranche first lien and second-lien debt) and unsecured debt (including mezzanine and subordinated debt), as well as related equity securities of private U.S. middle-market companies. We may purchase interests in loans or make debt investments, either (i) directly from our target companies as primary market or private credit investments (i.e., private credit transactions), or (ii) primary or secondary market bank loan or high yield transactions in the broadly syndicated \u201cover-the-counter\u201d market (i.e., broadly syndicated loans and bonds). Although our focus is to invest in less liquid private credit transactions, we may from time to time invest in more liquid broadly syndicated loans to complement our private credit transactions.\n\u201cFirst lien\u201d investments are senior loans on a lien basis to other liabilities in the issuer's capital structure that have the benefit of a first-priority security interest in assets of the issuer. The security interest ranks above the security interest of any second-lien lenders in those assets.\n\u201cUnitranche first lien\u201d investments are loans that may extend deeper in a company's capital structure than traditional first lien debt and may provide for a waterfall of cash flow priority among different lenders in the unitranche loan. In certain instances, we may find another lender to provide the \u201cfirst out\u201d portion of such loan and retain the \u201clast out\u201d portion of such loan, in which case, the \u201cfirst out\u201d portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder over the \u201clast out\u201d portion that we would continue to hold. In exchange for the greater risk of loss, the \u201clast out\u201d portion earns a higher interest rate.\n\u201cSecond lien\u201d investments are loans with a second priority lien on all existing and future assets of the portfolio company. The security interest ranks below the security interests of any first lien and unitranche first lien lenders in those assets.\n\u201cUnsecured debt\u201d investments are loans that generally rank senior to a borrower's equity securities and junior in right of payment to such borrower's other senior indebtedness.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed herein. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Valuation of Portfolio Investments, Revenue Recognition, Non-Accrual Investments, Distribution Policy, and Income Taxes.\nIn addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment Valuation\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider our principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in the determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:\nLevel 1-Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.\nLevel 2-Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3-Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our Audit Committee and, with certain de minimis exceptions, independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board.\nThe Board oversees and supervises a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:\n \u2022 The valuation process begins with each investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the portfolio management team. \n \u2022 The Adviser's management and Crescent's alternative investment valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuations with the investment professionals. Agreed upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee. \n \u2022 The Audit Committee reviews the valuations presented and recommends values for each investment to the Board. \n \u2022 The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment.  Investments in investment companies are valued at fair value. Fair values are generally determined utilizing the net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) supplied by, or on behalf of, management of each investment company, which is net of management and incentive fees or allocations charged by the investment company and is in accordance with the \u201cpractical expedient\u201d, as defined by ASC 820. NAVs received by, or on behalf of, management of each investment company are based on the fair value of the investment company's underlying investments in accordance with policies established by management of each investment company, as described in each of their financial statements and offering memorandum. Investments which are valued using NAV as a practical expedient are excluded from the above hierarchy.\nWe apply the valuation policy approved by the Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which its investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When a security is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for classification as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we review pricing methodologies provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Some additional factors considered include the number of prices obtained as well as an assessment as to their quality. Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the period in which the transfers occur.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different from the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein.\nInterest and Dividend Income Recognition\nInterest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the amortization of purchase discounts and premiums. Discounts and premiums to par value are accreted or amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion and amortization of discounts and premiums, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income.\nDividend income from common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies. Dividend income from preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Each distribution received from an equity investment is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments as dividend income unless there is sufficient current or accumulated earnings prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nCertain investments have contractual payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the loan principal or cost basis of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest income, as applicable. If at any point we believe PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. Accrued PIK interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest or dividend income, respectively, when an investment is placed on non-accrual status.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code. So long as we maintain the status as a RIC, we will generally not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our stockholders as dividends. As a result, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our stockholders and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. We account for income taxes in conformity with ASC 740 - Income Taxes (\u201cASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 provides guidelines for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in financial statements.\nIn order for us not to be subject to federal excise taxes, we must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of our ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections), (ii) 98.2% of our net capital gains from the current year and (iii) any undistributed ordinary income and net capital gains from preceding years. We, at our discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4% excise tax on this income. If we choose to do so, this generally would increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to stockholders. We accrue excise tax on estimated undistributed taxable income as required on a quarterly basis.\nCBDC Universal Equity, Inc. is a taxable entity (\u201cTaxable Subsidiary\u201d). The Taxable Subsidiary permits us to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are \u201cpass through\u201d entities for tax purposes and continue to comply with the \u201csource income\u201d requirements contained in RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiary is not consolidated with us for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe intend to comply with the applicable provisions of the Code, pertaining to regulated investment companies and to make distributions of taxable income sufficient to relieve it from substantially all federal income taxes. As of December 31, 2021, we are subject to examination by U.S. federal tax authorities for returns filed for the three most recent calendar years and by state tax authorities for returns filed for the four most recent calendar years.\nWe may generate qualified net interest income or qualified net short-term capital gains that may be exempt from U.S. withholding tax when distributed to foreign stockholders. A RIC is permitted to designate distributions of qualified net interest income and qualified short-term capital gains as exempt from U.S. withholding tax when paid to non-U.S. shareholders with proper documentation. As of December 31, 2021, the percentage of 2021 income estimated as qualified interest income for tax purposes was 86.7%\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2020-04, \u201cReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\u201d and in January 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2021-01 (\u201cASU 2021-01\u201d) \u201cReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope. This ASU provides optional exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions affected reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. ASU 2020-04 and 2021-01 are elective and can be adopted between March 12, 2020 and December 31, 2022. This guidance has no material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nCOMPONENTS OF OPERATIONS\nInvestments\nWe expect our investment activity to vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us, the level of merger and acquisition activity for middle-market companies, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to such companies and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. In addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce certain levels of investments through partial sales or syndication to additional investors.\nWe may not invest in any assets other than \u201cqualifying assets\u201d specified in the 1940 Act, unless, at the time the investments are made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in \u201celigible portfolio companies.\u201d Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, \u201celigible portfolio companies\u201d include certain companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than $250 million.\nThe Investment Adviser\nOur investment activities are managed by the Adviser, which is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser has entered into a resource sharing agreement with Crescent Capital Group LP (\u201cCrescent\u201d), pursuant to which Crescent provides the Adviser with experienced investment professionals (including the members of the Adviser's investment committee) and access to Crescent's resources so as to enable the Adviser to fulfill its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Through the resource sharing agreement, the Adviser intends to capitalize on the deal origination, credit underwriting, due diligence, investment structuring, execution, portfolio management and monitoring experience of Crescent's investment professionals. On January 5, 2021, Sun Life Financial Inc. (together with its subsidiaries and joint ventures, \u201cSun Life\u201d) acquired a majority interest in Crescent (the \u201cSun Life Transaction\u201d). There were no changes to our investment objective, strategies and process or to the Crescent team responsible for the investment operations as a result of the Sun Life Transaction.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments, capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Certain investments may have contractual PIK interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the loan principal of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable. We also generate revenue in the form of commitment or origination fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts into income over the life of the loan using the effective yield method.\nDividend income from common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies. Dividend income from preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected.\nWe may receive other income, which may include income such as consent, waiver, amendment, underwriting, and arranger fees associated with our investment activities as well as any fees for managerial assistance services rendered to the portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of management fees and incentive fees to the Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, as amended, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the administration agreement with our Administrator (the \u201cAdministration Agreement\u201d), operating costs associated with our third party sub-administrator and other operating costs described below. The management and incentive fees compensate the Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\n \u2022 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; \n \u2022 fidelity bond, directors' and officers' liability insurance and other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs; \n \u2022 independent directors' fees and expenses; \n \u2022 administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, rent and the allocable portion of the cost of certain professional services provided to us, including but not limited to, our accounting professionals, our legal counsel and compliance professionals); \n \u2022 U.S. federal, state and local taxes; \n \u2022 the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities; \n \u2022 fees payable to third parties relating to making investments, including out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments; \n \u2022 out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; \n \u2022 federal and state registration fees and any stock exchange listing fees; \n \u2022 brokerage commissions; \n \u2022 costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and other applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws; \n \u2022 debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; and \n \u2022 all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business.  We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines.\nLeverage\nOur financing facilities allow us to borrow money and lever our investment portfolio, subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, with the objective of increasing our yield. This is known as \u201cleverage\u201d and could increase or decrease returns to our stockholders. The use of leverage involves significant risks.\nIn accordance with applicable SEC staff guidance and interpretations, effective May 5, 2020 with shareholder approval, we, as a BDC, are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio is at least 150% after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met), rather than 200%, as previously required. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. The amount of leverage that we employ depends on our Adviser's and our Board's assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.\nPORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nWe seek to create a broad and diversified portfolio that generally includes senior secured first lien, unitranche, senior secured second lien, unsecured loans and minority equity securities of U.S. middle market companies. The size of our individual investments varies proportionately with the size of our capital base. We generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities have speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity.\nOur portfolio at fair value was comprised of the following:\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31,2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31,2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $ in millions\nInvestment Type\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fair\nValue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Secured First Lien\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>329.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>373.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unitranche First Lien\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>731.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>413.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unitranche First Lien -

Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had five investments across three portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which represented 1.6% and 1.2% of the total debt investments at cost and fair value, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had three investments across two portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which represented 1.7% and 1.3% of the total debt investments at cost and fair value, respectively. The remaining debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:\n \u2022 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; \n \u2022 review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. \n \u2022 contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; \n \u2022 comparisons to other companies in the industry; and \n \u2022 attendance and participation in board meetings. \nAs part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories:\n 1 Involves the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The investment/borrower is performing above expectations since investment, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may include the financial performance of the borrower or a potential exit. \n 2 Involves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of investment. The investment/borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. \n 3 Involves an investment/borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the investment's risk has increased somewhat since investment. The borrower's loan payments are generally not past due and more likely than not the borrower will remain in compliance with debt covenants. An investment rating of 3 requires closer monitoring. \n 4 Involves an investment/borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has increased materially since investment. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due). Placing loans on non-accrual status should be considered for investments rated 4. \n 5 Involves an investment/borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has substantially increased since investment. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and the fair market values of the loans are generally reduced to the anticipated recovery amounts. Loans with an investment rating of 5 are generally placed on non-accrual status. \nThe following table shows the composition of our portfolio on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale. Investment performance ratings are accurate only as of those dates and may change due to subsequent developments relating to a portfolio company's business or financial condition, market conditions or developments, and other factors.\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

increased from $71.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $85.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to organic net deployment and higher accelerated accretion of OID related to paydown activity. Included in interest from investments for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are $8.0 million and $2.3 million of accelerated accretion of OID, respectively.\nDividend income increased from $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to one-time dividend distributions from certain portfolio companies. Other income which includes consent, waiver, amendment, agency, underwriting and arranger fees associated with our investment activities decreased from $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nExpenses\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $ in millions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other debt financing costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income based incentive fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital gains based incentive fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directors' fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Management fee waiver\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.7 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income based incentive fees waiver\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income and excise taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Interest and other debt financing costs\nInterest and other debt financing costs include interest, amortization of deferred financing costs including upfront commitment fees and unused fees on our credit facilities. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 interest and other debt financing costs were $19.8 million and $15.5 million, respectively. The increase was due to a higher weighted average debt outstanding and acceleration of the amortization of certain deferred financing costs in conjunction with the termination of a credit facility in 2021.\nBase Management Fees\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred management fees of $14.1 million and $11.4 million, of which $3.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively, were waived. The increase in net management fees was driven by growing assets under management and expiration of the management fee waiver on July 31, 2021.\nIncentive Fees\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we incurred income based incentive fees of $9.8 million and $8.6 million, of which $7.5 million and $8.6 million, respectively, were waived. The increase in income based incentive fees was driven by expiration of the income based incentive fee waiver on July 31, 2021.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we accrued $6.3 million and $0, respectively, of capital gains based incentive fees. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $6.3 million and $0, respectively, was accrued and unpaid. The increase in incentive fees on cumulative unrealized capital appreciation was attributable to the inception to date performance of the investment portfolio.\nProfessional Fees and Other General and Administrative Expenses\nProfessional fees generally include expenses from independent auditors, tax advisors, legal counsel and third party valuation agents. Other general and administrative expenses generally include overhead and staffing costs allocated from the Administrator, insurance premiums, third party sub-administrator expenses and miscellaneous administrative costs associated with our operations and investment activity.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, professional fees were $1.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, other general and administrative expenses were $2.6 million, respectively.\nThe cumulative increase in professional fees and other general and administrative expenses was attributable to servicing a growing investment portfolio.\nIncome and Excise Taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we expensed income and excise taxes of $2.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The increase in income and excise tax was attributable to $1.7 million of income tax due on flow through taxable income from equity investments held in a blocker. Allocated flow through taxable income is typically offset by tax distributions, which are recorded under dividend income.\nNet Investment Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, GAAP net investment income was $47.6 million or $1.67 per share and $49.9 million or $1.80 per share, respectively. The decrease was due to accrued capital gains based incentive fees recorded during current year.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, net investment income excluding capital gains incentive fees (\u201cAdjusted Net Investment Income\u201d) was $53.9 million or $1.89 per share and $49.9 million or $1.80 per share, respectively. The increase was due to a higher investment income from a growing investment portfolio and higher accelerated amortization income.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net investment income (the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to Adjusted Net Investment Income for the periods presented:\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the years ended December 31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Per Share </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Per Share </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP net investment income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.80 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital gains based incentive fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted Net Investment Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.80 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> On a supplemental basis, we are disclosing Adjusted Net Investment Income and per share Adjusted Net Investment Income, each of which is a financial measure that is calculated and presented on a basis of methodology other than in accordance with U.S. GAAP (\u201cnon-GAAP\u201d). Adjusted Net Investment Income represents net investment income, excluding capital gains incentive fees. We use this non-GAAP financial measure internally to analyze and evaluate financial results and performance and believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends without giving effect to capital gains incentive fees. Our investment advisory agreement provides that a capital gains-based incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to realized capital gains (but not unrealized capital appreciation) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis. We believe that Adjusted Net Investment Income is a useful performance measure because it reflects the net investment income produced on our investments during a period\nwithout giving effect to any changes in the value of such investments and any related capital gains incentive fees between periods. The presentation of Adjusted Net Investment Income is not intended to be a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\nWe value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. Net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investment portfolio were comprised of the following:\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

credit or other risks. Generally, we do not intend to enter into any such derivative agreements for speculative purposes. Any derivative agreements entered into for speculative purposes are not expected to be material to our business or results of operations. These hedging activities, which are in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, may include the use of various instruments, including futures, options and forward contracts. We bear the costs incurred in connection with entering into, administering and settling any such derivative contracts. There can be no assurance any hedging strategy we employ will be successful.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our average U.S. Dollar notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts were $61.5 million and $35.8 million, respectively.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are for (1) investments in portfolio companies and other investments; (2) the cost of operations (including paying the Adviser); (3) debt service, repayment, and other financing costs; and (4) cash distributions to the holders of our common stock. We expect to generate additional liquidity from (1) future offerings of securities, (2) future borrowings and (3) cash flows from operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $23.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents and $197.0 million of undrawn capacity on our senior revolving credit and special purpose vehicle asset facilities, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. As of December 31, 2021, the undrawn capacity under our facilities is in excess of our unfunded commitments.\nWe believe that there is sufficient assets and liquidity to adequately cover future obligations under unfunded commitments. The cash and restricted cash balances, availability under the credit facilities and ongoing investment realizations are expected to provide sufficient liquidity. In addition, broadly syndicated loans in the portfolio could be sold over a relatively short period to generate liquidity. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with our asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act. In addition, we were in compliance with all the financial covenant requirements of our credit facilities as of December 31, 2021. However, any increase in realized losses or unrealized depreciation of our investment portfolio or significant reductions in our net asset value as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, increase the risk of breaching the relevant covenants requirements. Any breach of these requirements may adversely affect the access to sufficient debt and equity capital.\nCapital Share Activity\nBetween June 26, 2015, commencement of operations, and January 31, 2020, the date of Alcentra Acquisition, we entered into subscription agreements (collectively, the \u201cSubscription Agreements\u201d) with several investors, including Crescent, providing for the private placement of our common shares. Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, between June 26, 2015 and January 31, 2020, we issued 23,127,335 common shares for aggregate proceeds of $456.3 million, of which $10.0 million was from Crescent. Proceeds from the issuances were used to fund our investing activities and for other general corporate purposes. Subsequently, on January 31, 2020, we issued 5,203,016 shares in connection with the Alcentra Acquisition. Upon closing of the Alcentra Acquisition, all unfunded commitments of stockholders subscribing in the private offering were terminated.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued 30,128

(\u201cCCAP SPV\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of CCAP, entered into a loan and security agreement, as amended from time to time (the \u201cSPV Asset Facility\u201d) with us as the collateral manager, seller and equity holder, CCAP SPV as the borrower, the banks and other financial institutions from time to time party thereto as lenders, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d), as administrative agent, collateral agent, and lender. We consolidate CCAP SPV in our consolidated financial statements and no gain or loss is recognized from the transfer of assets to and from CCAP SPV.\nThe maximum commitment amount under the SPV Asset Facility is $350.0 million, and may be increased with the consent of Wells Fargo or reduced upon our request. Proceeds of the advances under the SPV Asset Facility may be used to acquire portfolio investments, to make distributions to us in accordance with the SPV Asset Facility, and to pay related expenses. The maturity date is the earlier of (a) the date the borrower voluntarily reduces the commitments to zero, (b) June 22, 2026 and (c) the date upon which Wells Fargo declares the obligations due and payable after the occurrence of an Event of Default. Borrowings under the SPV Asset Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin with no LIBOR floor. The margin is between 1.65% and 2.10% as determined by the proportion of liquid and illiquid loans pledged to the SPV Asset Facility. We generally pay unused facility fees of 0.50% per annum on committed but undrawn amounts under the SPV Asset Facility. The unused facility fee rate may vary based on the utilization. The SPV Asset Facility includes customary covenants, including certain limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens, as well as usual and customary events of default for revolving credit facilities of this nature.\nThe facility size is subject to availability under the borrowing base, which is based on the amount of CCAP SPV's assets from time to time, and satisfaction of certain conditions, including an asset coverage test and certain concentration limits.\nSMBC Corporate Revolving Facility\nOn October 27, 2021, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and Lender (the \u201cSMBC Corporate Revolving Facility\u201d). The maximum principal amount of the SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility is $300.0 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base. Borrowings under the SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.875% or 2.000%, subject to certain provisions in the SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility agreement, with no LIBOR floor. Any amounts borrowed under the SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility, and all accrued and unpaid interest, will be due and payable, on October 27, 2026\nAlly Corporate Revolving Facility\nOn August 20, 2019, we entered into the \u201cAlly Corporate Revolving Facility\u201d with Ally Bank, as Administrative Agent and Arranger. The maximum principal amount of the Ally Corporate Revolving Facility was $200.0 million, subject to availability under the borrowing base. Borrowings under the Ally Corporate Revolving Facility bore interest at LIBOR plus a 2.35% margin with no LIBOR floor.\nWe terminated the Ally Corporate Revolving Facility concurrent with the closing of the SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility, on October 27, 2021.\nUnsecured Notes\nOn July 30, 2020, we completed a private offering of $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.95% senior unsecured notes due July 30, 2023 (the \u201c2023 Unsecured Notes\u201d). The 2023 Unsecured Notes were issued in two $25.0 million issuances on July 30, 2020 and October 28, 2020.\nThe 2023 Unsecured Notes will mature on July 30, 2023 and may be redeemed in whole or in part, at our option, at par plus a \u201cmake-whole\u201d premium, if applicable. Interest on the 2023 Unsecured Notes is due and payable semiannually in arrears on January 30 and July 30 of each year. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the terms of the note purchase agreement governing the 2023 Unsecured Notes.\n2026 Unsecured Notes\nOn February 17, 2021, we completed a private offering of $135.0 aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured notes due February 17, 2026 (the \u201c2026 Unsecured Notes\u201d). The initial issuance of $50.0 of 2026 Unsecured Notes closed February 17, 2021. The issuance of the remaining $85.0 of 2026 Unsecured Notes closed on May 5, 2021.\nThe 2026 Unsecured Notes will mature on February 17, 2026 and may be redeemed in whole or in part, at our option, at par plus a \u201cmake-whole\u201d premium, if applicable. Interest on the 2026 Unsecured Notes is due and payable semiannually in arrears on February 17 and August 17 of each year. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the terms of the note purchase agreement governing the 2026 Unsecured Notes.\nInterNotes\u00ae\nOn January 31, 2020, in connection with the Alcentra Acquisition, we assumed direct unsecured fixed interest rate obligations or \u201cInterNotes\u00ae\u201d. The InterNotes\u00ae bore interest at fixed interest rates ranging between 6.25% and 6.75% and offered a variety of maturities ranging between February 15, 2021 and April 15, 2022. We redeemed or paid down the remaining $16.4 million of InterNotes\u00ae during the first quarter of 2021.\nThe summary of costs incurred in connection with the SPV Asset Facility, SMBC Corporate Revolving Facility, Ally Corporate Revolving Facility, 2023 Unsecured Notes, 2026 Unsecured Notes and InterNotes\u00ae is presented below:\n$ in millions\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowing interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unused facility fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of financing costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest and credit facility expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average outstanding balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>530.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>421.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> To the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced opportunities, or if our Board otherwise determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interest and the best interests of our stockholders, we may enter into new debt financing opportunities in addition to our existing debt. The pricing and other terms of any such opportunities would depend upon market conditions and the performance of our business, among other factors.\nIn accordance with applicable SEC staff guidance and interpretations, effective May 5, 2020 with shareholder approval, we, as a BDC, are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio is at least 150% after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met), rather than 200%, as previously required. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. The amount of leverage that we employ depends on our Adviser's and our Board's assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our asset coverage ratio was 201% and 217%, respectively. We may also refinance or repay any of our indebtedness at any time based on our financial condition and market conditions. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for more detail on the debt facilities.\nSTOCK PURCHASE AND REPURCHASE PROGRAMS\nCCAP Repurchase Program\nOn January 31, 2020, we entered into a $20.0 million repurchase plan which allowed us to purchase shares in the open market any time our common stock traded below 90% of the most recently disclosed net asset value per share. The plan was subject to compliance with our liquidity, covenant, leverage and regulatory requirements. Pursuant to the terms of the repurchase plan, repurchases began on March 2, 2020. On April 9, 2020, our Board of Directors unanimously approved the termination of the stock repurchase program.\nThere was no stock repurchased for the year ended December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 192,415 shares at an average price per share, including commissions, of $11.48.\nSun Life Purchase Program\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Sun Life Financial Inc., the majority owner of Crescent, our investment advisor, commenced two $10.0 million stock purchase plans to make open-market purchases of shares of our common stock. The purchases were conducted in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and other applicable securities laws and regulations that set certain restrictions on the method, timing, price, and volume of stock purchases.

Unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the on-balance sheet financial instruments that we hold. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had aggregate unfunded commitments totaling $196.7 million and $80.8 million, respectively.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nOn February 18, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.41 per share, which will be paid on April 15, 2022 to stockholders of record as of March 31, 2022.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. This discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in \u201cITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\u201d Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. In this report, \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and \u201cCompany\u201d refer to Crescent Capital BDC, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a specialty finance company focused on lending to middle-market companies. We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 5, 2015 and on January 30, 2020, we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Delaware to the State of Maryland. We were listed and began trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange on February 3, 2020. We have elected to be treated as a business development company (\u201cBDC\u201d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (\u201c1940 Act\u201d). In addition, we have elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (a \u201cRIC\u201d) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). As such, we are required to comply with various regulatory requirements, such as the requirement to invest at least 70% of our assets in \u201cqualifying assets,\u201d source of income limitations, asset diversification requirements, and the requirement to distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income and tax-exempt interest.\nWe are managed by Crescent Cap Advisors, LLC (the \u201cAdviser\u201d), an investment adviser that is registered with the SEC under the 1940 Act. CCAP Administration, LLC (the \u201cAdministrator\u201d), provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. Our management consists of investment and administrative professionals from the Adviser and Administrator along with our Board. The Adviser directs and executes our investment operations and capital raising activities subject to oversight from the Board, which sets our broad policies. The Board has delegated investment management of our investment assets to the Adviser. The Board consists of five directors, four of whom are independent.\nOur investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments. We invest primarily in secured debt (including first lien, unitranche first lien and second-lien debt) and unsecured debt (including mezzanine and subordinated debt), as well as related equity securities of private U.S. middle-market companies. We may purchase interests in loans or make debt investments, either (i) directly from our target companies as primary market or private credit investments (i.e., private credit transactions), or (ii) primary or secondary market bank loan or high yield transactions in the broadly syndicated \u201cover-the-counter\u201d market (i.e., broadly syndicated loans and bonds). Although our focus is to invest in less liquid private credit transactions, we may from time to time invest in more liquid broadly syndicated loans to complement our private credit transactions.\n\u201cFirst lien\u201d investments are senior loans on a lien basis to other liabilities in the issuer's capital structure that have the benefit of a first-priority security interest in assets of the issuer. The security interest ranks above the security interest of any second-lien lenders in those assets.\n\u201cUnitranche first lien\u201d investments are loans that may extend deeper in a company's capital structure than traditional first lien debt and may provide for a waterfall of cash flow priority among different lenders in the unitranche loan. In certain instances, we may find another lender to provide the \u201cfirst out\u201d portion of such loan and retain the \u201clast out\u201d portion of such loan, in which case, the \u201cfirst out\u201d portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder over the \u201clast out\u201d portion that we would continue to hold. In exchange for the greater risk of loss, the \u201clast out\u201d portion earns a higher interest rate.\n\u201cSecond lien\u201d investments are loans with a second priority lien on all existing and future assets of the portfolio company. The security interest ranks below the security interests of any first lien and unitranche first lien lenders in those assets.\n\u201cUnsecured debt\u201d investments are loans that generally rank senior to a borrower's equity securities and junior in right of payment to such borrower's other senior indebtedness.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors as disclosed herein. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Valuation of Portfolio Investments, Revenue Recognition, Non-Accrual Investments, Distribution Policy, and Income Taxes.\nIn addition to the discussion below, our critical accounting policies are further described in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment Valuation\nWe apply Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), as amended, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP and required disclosures of fair value measurements. ASC 820 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for an investment in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market (which may be a hypothetical market) that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. In accordance with ASC 820, we consider our principal market to be the market that has the greatest volume and level of activity. ASC 820 specifies a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes and ranks the level of observability of inputs used in the determination of fair value. In accordance with ASC 820, these levels are summarized below:\nLevel 1-Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.\nLevel 2-Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3-Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\nInvestments for which market quotations are readily available are typically valued at those market quotations. To validate market quotations, we utilize a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value, including the source and number of the quotations. Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on, among other things, the input of the Adviser, our Audit Committee and, with certain de minimis exceptions, independent third-party valuation firms engaged at the direction of the Board.\nThe Board oversees and supervises a multi-step valuation process, which includes, among other procedures, the following:\n \u2022 The valuation process begins with each investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment in conjunction with the portfolio management team. \n \u2022 The Adviser's management and Crescent's alternative investment valuation committee reviews the preliminary valuations with the investment professionals. Agreed upon valuation recommendations are presented to the Audit Committee. \n \u2022 The Audit Committee reviews the valuations presented and recommends values for each investment to the Board. \n \u2022 The Board reviews the recommended valuations and determines the fair value of each investment.  Investments in investment companies are valued at fair value. Fair values are generally determined utilizing the net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) supplied by, or on behalf of, management of each investment company, which is net of management and incentive fees or allocations charged by the investment company and is in accordance with the \u201cpractical expedient\u201d, as defined by ASC 820. NAVs received by, or on behalf of, management of each investment company are based on the fair value of the investment company's underlying investments in accordance with policies established by management of each investment company, as described in each of their financial statements and offering memorandum. Investments which are valued using NAV as a practical expedient are excluded from the above hierarchy.\nWe apply the valuation policy approved by the Board that is consistent with ASC 820. Consistent with the valuation policy, we evaluate the source of inputs, including any markets in which its investments are trading (or any markets in which securities with similar attributes are trading), in determining fair value. When a security is valued based on prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services (that is, broker quotes), we subject those prices to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular investment would qualify for classification as a Level 2 or Level 3 investment. For example, we review pricing methodologies provided by dealers or pricing services in order to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Some additional factors considered include the number of prices obtained as well as an assessment as to their quality. Transfers between levels, if any, are recognized at the beginning of the period in which the transfers occur.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of such investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be realized. Further, such investments are generally less liquid than publicly traded securities and may be subject to contractual and other restrictions on resale. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we could realize amounts that are different from the amounts presented and such differences could be material. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different from the unrealized gains or losses reflected herein.\nInterest and Dividend Income Recognition\nInterest income is recorded on an accrual basis and includes the amortization of purchase discounts and premiums. Discounts and premiums to par value are accreted or amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the respective security using the effective yield method. The amortized cost of investments represents the original cost adjusted for the accretion and amortization of discounts and premiums, if any. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment premiums, unamortized upfront loan origination fees and unamortized discounts are recorded as interest income.\nDividend income from common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies. Dividend income from preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Each distribution received from an equity investment is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments as dividend income unless there is sufficient current or accumulated earnings prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nCertain investments have contractual payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the loan principal or cost basis of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest income, as applicable. If at any point we believe PIK is not expected to be realized, the investment generating PIK will be placed on non-accrual status. Accrued PIK interest or dividends are generally reversed through interest or dividend income, respectively, when an investment is placed on non-accrual status.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 30 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We also have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Internal Revenue Code. So long as we maintain the status as a RIC, we will generally not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income or excise taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our stockholders as dividends. As a result, any tax liability related to income earned and distributed by us represents obligations of our stockholders and will not be reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the consolidated financial statements to determine whether the tax positions are \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d threshold are reversed and recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. All penalties and interest associated with income taxes are included in income tax expense. Conclusions regarding tax positions are subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. We account for income taxes in conformity with ASC 740 - Income Taxes (\u201cASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 provides guidelines for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in financial statements.\nIn order for us not to be subject to federal excise taxes, we must distribute annually an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of our ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections), (ii) 98.2% of our net capital gains from the current year and (iii) any undistributed ordinary income and net capital gains from preceding years. We, at our discretion, may carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year dividends and pay a 4% excise tax on this income. If we choose to do so, this generally would increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to stockholders. We accrue excise tax on estimated undistributed taxable income as required on a quarterly basis.\nCBDC Universal Equity, Inc. is a taxable entity (\u201cTaxable Subsidiary\u201d). The Taxable Subsidiary permits us to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are \u201cpass through\u201d entities for tax purposes and continue to comply with the \u201csource income\u201d requirements contained in RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiary is not consolidated with us for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe intend to comply with the applicable provisions of the Code, pertaining to regulated investment companies and to make distributions of taxable income sufficient to relieve it from substantially all federal income taxes. As of December 31, 2021, we are subject to examination by U.S. federal tax authorities for returns filed for the three most recent calendar years and by state tax authorities for returns filed for the four most recent calendar years.\nWe may generate qualified net interest income or qualified net short-term capital gains that may be exempt from U.S. withholding tax when distributed to foreign stockholders. A RIC is permitted to designate distributions of qualified net interest income and qualified short-term capital gains as exempt from U.S. withholding tax when paid to non-U.S. shareholders with proper documentation. As of December 31, 2021, the percentage of 2021 income estimated as qualified interest income for tax purposes was 86.7%\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2020-04, \u201cReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\u201d and in January 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2021-01 (\u201cASU 2021-01\u201d) \u201cReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope. This ASU provides optional exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions affected reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. ASU 2020-04 and 2021-01 are elective and can be adopted between March 12, 2020 and December 31, 2022. This guidance has no material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nCOMPONENTS OF OPERATIONS\nInvestments\nWe expect our investment activity to vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us, the level of merger and acquisition activity for middle-market companies, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to such companies and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. In addition, as part of our risk strategy on investments, we may reduce certain levels of investments through partial sales or syndication to additional investors.\nWe may not invest in any assets other than \u201cqualifying assets\u201d specified in the 1940 Act, unless, at the time the investments are made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in \u201celigible portfolio companies.\u201d Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, \u201celigible portfolio companies\u201d include certain companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than $250 million.\nThe Investment Adviser\nOur investment activities are managed by the Adviser, which is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser has entered into a resource sharing agreement with Crescent Capital Group LP (\u201cCrescent\u201d), pursuant to which Crescent provides the Adviser with experienced investment professionals (including the members of the Adviser's investment committee) and access to Crescent's resources so as to enable the Adviser to fulfill its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Through the resource sharing agreement, the Adviser intends to capitalize on the deal origination, credit underwriting, due diligence, investment structuring, execution, portfolio management and monitoring experience of Crescent's investment professionals. On January 5, 2021, Sun Life Financial Inc. (together with its subsidiaries and joint ventures, \u201cSun Life\u201d) acquired a majority interest in Crescent (the \u201cSun Life Transaction\u201d). There were no changes to our investment objective, strategies and process or to the Crescent team responsible for the investment operations as a result of the Sun Life Transaction.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue primarily in the form of interest income on debt investments, capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Certain investments may have contractual PIK interest or dividends. PIK represents accrued interest or accumulated dividends that are added to the loan principal of the investment on the respective interest or dividend payment dates rather than being paid in cash and generally becomes due at maturity or upon being called by the issuer. PIK is recorded as interest or dividend income, as applicable. We also generate revenue in the form of commitment or origination fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts into income over the life of the loan using the effective yield method.\nDividend income from common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly-traded portfolio companies. Dividend income from preferred equity securities is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected.\nWe may receive other income, which may include income such as consent, waiver, amendment, underwriting, and arranger fees associated with our investment activities as well as any fees for managerial assistance services rendered to the portfolio companies. Such fees are recognized as income when earned or the services are rendered.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of management fees and incentive fees to the Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement, as amended, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the administration agreement with our Administrator (the \u201cAdministration Agreement\u201d), operating costs associated with our third party sub-administrator and other operating costs described below. The management and incentive fees compensate the Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\n \u2022 the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services; \n \u2022 fidelity bond, directors' and officers' liability insurance and other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs; \n \u2022 independent directors' fees and expenses; \n \u2022 administration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrator's overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, rent and the allocable portion of the cost of certain professional services provided to us, including but not limited to, our accounting professionals, our legal counsel and compliance professionals); \n \u2022 U.S. federal, state and local taxes; \n \u2022 the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities; \n \u2022 fees payable to third parties relating to making investments, including out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments; \n \u2022 out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; \n \u2022 federal and state registration fees and any stock exchange listing fees; \n \u2022 brokerage commissions; \n \u2022 costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and other applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws; \n \u2022 debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; and \n \u2022 all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business.  We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines.\nLeverage\nOur financing facilities allow us to borrow money and lever our investment portfolio, subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act, with the objective of increasing our yield. This is known as \u201cleverage\u201d and could increase or decrease returns to our stockholders. The use of leverage involves significant risks.\nIn accordance with applicable SEC staff guidance and interpretations, effective May 5, 2020 with shareholder approval, we, as a BDC, are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio is at least 150% after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met), rather than 200%, as previously required. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. The amount of leverage that we employ depends on our Adviser's and our Board's assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.\nPORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nWe seek to create a broad and diversified portfolio that generally includes senior secured first lien, unitranche, senior secured second lien, unsecured loans and minority equity securities of U.S. middle market companies. The size of our individual investments varies proportionately with the size of our capital base. We generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities have speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity.\nOur portfolio at fair value was comprised of the following:\n The following table shows our investment activity by investment type:\n\n (1) Excludes $195.7 million of assets at cost acquired in connection with the Alcentra Acquisition. The assets acquired, at cost, were comprised of $82.2 million of senior secured first lien, $45.0 million of unitranche first lien, $53.0 million of senior secured second lien, $1.2 million of unsecured debt and $14.3 million of equity investments. \nThe following table presents certain selected information regarding our investment portfolio:\n\n (1) Yield excludes investments on non-accrual status. \nThe following table shows the amortized cost and fair value of our performing and non-accrual debt and income producing debt securities:\n Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid current and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. Management may determine to not place a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had five investments across three portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which represented 1.6% and 1.2% of the total debt investments at cost and fair value, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had three investments across two portfolio companies on non-accrual status, which represented 1.7% and 1.3% of the total debt investments at cost and fair value, respectively. The remaining debt investments were performing and current on their interest payments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe Adviser monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Adviser monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:\n \u2022 assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; \n \u2022 review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. \n \u2022 contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; \n \u2022 comparisons to other companies in the industry; and \n \u2022 attendance and participation in board meetings. \nAs part of the monitoring process, the Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 5. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories:\n 1 Involves the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The investment/borrower is performing above expectations since investment, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may include the financial performance of the borrower or a potential exit. \n 2 Involves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of investment. The investment/borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable. \n 3 Involves an investment/borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the investment's risk has increased somewhat since investment. The borrower's loan payments are generally not past due and more likely than not the borrower will remain in compliance with debt covenants. An investment rating of 3 requires closer monitoring. \n 4 Involves an investment/borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has increased materially since investment. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments may be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due). Placing loans on non-accrual status should be considered for investments rated 4. \n 5 Involves an investment/borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loan's risk has substantially increased since investment. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 5 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and the fair market values of the loans are generally reduced to the anticipated recovery amounts. Loans with an investment rating of 5 are generally placed on non-accrual status. \nThe following table shows the composition of our portfolio on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale. Investment performance ratings are accurate only as of those dates and may change due to subsequent developments relating to a portfolio company's business or financial condition, market conditions or developments, and other factors.\n RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOperating results were as follows:\n\nInvestment Income\n Interest income, which includes amortization of upfront fees, increased from $71.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $85.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, due to organic net deployment and higher accelerated accretion of OID related to paydown activity. Included in interest from investments for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are $8.0 million and $2.3 million of accelerated accretion of OID, respectively.\nDividend income increased from $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 due to one-time dividend distributions from certain portfolio companies. Other income which includes consent, waiver, amendment, agency, underwriting and arranger fees associated with our investment activities decreased from $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nExpenses\n Interest and other debt financing costs\nInterest and other debt financing costs include interest, amortization of deferred financing costs including upfront commitment fees and unused fees on our credit facilities. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 interest and other debt financing costs were $19.8 million and $15.5 million, respectively. The increase was due to a higher weighted average debt outstanding and acceleration of the amortization of certain deferred financing costs in conjunction with the termination of a credit facility in 2021.\nBase Management Fees\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we incurred management fees of $14.1 million and $11.4 million, of which $3.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively, were waived. The increase in net management fees was driven by growing assets under management and expiration of the management fee waiver on July 31, 2021.\nIncentive Fees\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we incurred income based incentive fees of $9.8 million and $8.6 million, of which $7.5 million and $8.6 million, respectively, were waived. The increase in income based incentive fees was driven by expiration of the income based incentive fee waiver on July 31, 2021.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we accrued $6.3 million and $0, respectively, of capital gains based incentive fees. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $6.3 million and $0, respectively, was accrued and unpaid. The increase in incentive fees on cumulative unrealized capital appreciation was attributable to the inception to date performance of the investment portfolio.\nProfessional Fees and Other General and Administrative Expenses\nProfessional fees generally include expenses from independent auditors, tax advisors, legal counsel and third party valuation agents. Other general and administrative expenses generally include overhead and staffing costs allocated from the Administrator, insurance premiums, third party sub-administrator expenses and miscellaneous administrative costs associated with our operations and investment activity.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, professional fees were $1.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, other general and administrative expenses were $2.6 million, respectively.\nThe cumulative increase in professional fees and other general and administrative expenses was attributable to servicing a growing investment portfolio.\nIncome and Excise Taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we expensed income and excise taxes of $2.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The increase in income and excise tax was attributable to $1.7 million of income tax due on flow through taxable income from equity investments held in a blocker. Allocated flow through taxable income is typically offset by tax distributions, which are recorded under dividend income.\nNet Investment Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, GAAP net investment income was $47.6 million or $1.67 per share and $49.9 million or $1.80 per share, respectively. The decrease was due to accrued capital gains based incentive fees recorded during current year.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, net investment income excluding capital gains incentive fees (\u201cAdjusted Net Investment Income\u201d) was $53.9 million or $1.89 per share and $49.9 million or $1.80 per share, respectively. The increase was due to a higher investment income from a growing investment portfolio and higher accelerated amortization income.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net investment income (the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to Adjusted Net Investment Income for the periods presented:\n On a supplemental basis, we are disclosing Adjusted Net Investment Income and per share Adjusted Net Investment Income, each of which is a financial measure that is calculated and presented on a basis of methodology other than in accordance with U.S. GAAP (\u201cnon-GAAP\u201d). Adjusted Net Investment Income represents net investment income, excluding capital gains incentive fees. We use this non-GAAP financial measure internally to analyze and evaluate financial results and performance and believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends without giving effect to capital gains incentive fees. Our investment advisory agreement provides that a capital gains-based incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to realized capital gains (but not unrealized capital appreciation) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis. We believe that Adjusted Net Investment Income is a useful performance measure because it reflects the net investment income produced on our investments during a period\nwithout giving effect to any changes in the value of such investments and any related capital gains incentive fees between periods. The presentation of Adjusted Net Investment Income is not intended to be a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\nWe value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. Net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investment portfolio were comprised of the following:\n Hedging\nWe may, but are not required to, enter into interest rate, foreign exchange or other derivative agreements to hedge interest rate, currency, credit or other risks. Generally, we do not intend to enter into any such derivative agreements for speculative purposes. Any derivative agreements entered into for speculative purposes are not expected to be material to our business or results of operations. These hedging activities, which are in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, may include the use of various instruments, including futures, options and forward contracts. We bear the costs incurred in connection with entering into, administering and settling any such derivative contracts. There can be no assurance any hedging strategy we employ will be successful.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our average U.S. Dollar notional exposure to foreign currency forward contracts were $61.5 million and $35.8 million, respectively.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe primary uses of our cash and cash equivalents are for (1) investments in portfolio companies and other investments; (2) the cost of operations (including paying the Adviser); (3) debt service, repayment, and other financing costs; and (4) cash distributions to the holders of our common stock. We expect to generate additional liquidity from (1) future offerings of securities, (2) future borrowings and (3) cash flows from operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $23.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents and $197.0 million of undrawn capacity on our senior revolving credit and special purpose vehicle asset facilities, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. As of December 31, 2021, the undrawn capacity under our facilities is in excess of our unfunded commitments.\nWe believe that there is sufficient assets and liquidity to adequately cover future obligations under unfunded commitments. The cash and restricted cash balances, availability under the credit facilities and ongoing investment realizations are expected to provide sufficient liquidity. In addition, broadly syndicated loans in the portfolio could be sold over a relatively short period to generate liquidity. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with our asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act. In addition, we were in compliance with all the financial covenant requirements of our credit facilities as of December 31, 2021. However, any increase in realized losses or unrealized depreciation of our investment portfolio or significant reductions in our net asset value as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, increase the risk of breaching the relevant covenants requirements. Any breach of these requirements may adversely affect the access to sufficient debt and equity capital.\nCapital Share Activity\nBetween June 26, 2015, commencement of operations, and January 31, 2020, the date of Alcentra Acquisition, we entered into subscription agreements (collectively, the \u201cSubscription Agreements\u201d) with several investors, including Crescent, providing for the private placement of our common shares. Pursuant to the Subscription Agreements, between June 26, 2015 and January 31, 2020, we issued 23,127,335 common shares for aggregate proceeds of $456.3 million, of which $10.0 million was from Crescent.

The pricing and other terms of any such opportunities would depend upon market conditions and the performance of our business, among other factors.\nIn accordance with applicable SEC staff guidance and interpretations, effective May 5, 2020 with shareholder approval, we, as a BDC, are permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio is at least 150% after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met), rather than 200%, as previously required. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. The amount of leverage that we employ depends on our Adviser's and our Board's assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our asset coverage ratio was 201% and 217%, respectively. We may also refinance or repay any of our indebtedness at any time based on our financial condition and market conditions.

Unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.
