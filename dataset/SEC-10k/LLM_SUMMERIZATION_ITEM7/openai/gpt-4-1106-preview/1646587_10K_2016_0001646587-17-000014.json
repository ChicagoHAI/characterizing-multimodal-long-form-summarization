Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and risk factors in Part I. Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d of this report. References to NorthStar Europe,\u201d we,\u201d us\u201d or our\u201d refer to NorthStar Realty Europe Corp. and its subsidiaries unless the context specifically requires otherwise. References to our Manager\u201d refer to NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. for the period prior to the Mergers (refer below) and Colony NorthStar, Inc., for the period subsequent to the Mergers. As part of the Merger, NSAM changed its name to Colony NorthStar, Inc.\nIntroduction\nNorthStar Realty Europe Corp., a publicly-traded REIT, is a European focused commercial real estate company with predominantly prime office properties in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France. Our objective is to provide our stockholders with stable and recurring cash flow supplemented by capital growth over time. We commenced operations on November 1, 2015 following the spin-off by NorthStar Realty of its European real estate business (excluding its European healthcare properties) into a separate publicly-traded company, NorthStar Europe, a Maryland corporation, or the Spin-off.\nUpon completion of the Spin-off, NorthStar Realty contributed: (i) its business activities related to the U.K. Complex, acquired on September 16, 2014; (ii) the New European Investments; and (iii) certain other assets and liabilities related to NorthStar Realty's European real estate business, herein collectively referred to as the European Real Estate Business.\nOn November 2, 2015, our common stock began trading on the NYSE under the symbol NRE.\u201d We are externally managed and advised by an affiliate of our Manager. Substantially all of our assets, directly or indirectly, are held by, and we conduct our operations, directly or indirectly, through our Operating Partnership. We have elected to be taxed and will continue to conduct our operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nSignificant Developments\nSales Initiatives\nIn 2016, we announced a strategy to focus on prime office properties located in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France. As a result, we undertook a sales initiative, selling 22 properties as of March 1, 2017 and realizing $380 million of net proceeds. Consequently, we no longer operate in Belgium, Italy or Sweden. In 2017, we expect to continue executing on our sales initiatives primarily with the goal of maximizing long-term stockholder value.\nSenior Notes\nIn 2016, we repurchased approximately $272.3 million of the Senior Notes and settled the remaining Senior Notes in cash at maturity.\nMergers Agreement among NSAM, NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc.\nOn January 10, 2017, our external manager, NSAM completed a tri-party merger with NorthStar Realty and Colony under which the companies combined in an all-stock merger of equals transaction to create a diversified real estate and investment management company. Under the terms of the merger agreement, NSAM, Colony and NorthStar Realty, through a series of transactions, merged with and into NSAM, which was renamed Colony NorthStar. Colony NorthStar is a leading global equity REIT with an embedded investment management platform.\nSummary of Business\nOur primary business line is European real estate. We are predominantly focused on prime office properties located in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France. The following table presents a summary of assets acquired and sold for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and the period from January 1, 2017 to March 1, 2017:\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Germany\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>United Kingdom\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>France\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We committed to acquire the majority of our properties in 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flows\nWe primarily generate revenue from rental and other operating income generated by our properties. Our income is primarily derived through the difference between the revenue and the operating and financing costs of our investments. We may also continue to acquire investments that generate attractive returns without any leverage.\nProfitability and Performance Metrics\nWe calculate cash available for distribution, or CAD, and net operating income, or NOI as metrics to evaluate the profitability and performance of our business (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a description of these metrics).\nOutlook and Recent Trends\nThe European economy concluded another positive year of growth in 2016. Fourth quarter Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, in the European Union, or the EU, and the Euro Area grew by 1.9% and 1.7% year on year, respectively. This represented the fourteenth consecutive quarter of growth in the Eurozone which outpaced the U.S. economy in 2016. In December of 2016, the European Central Bank, or ECB, extended its quantitative easing program until the end of 2017 while reducing the average volume of asset purchases from \u20ac80 billion to \u20ac60 billion per month from April 2017. The monetary stimulus provided by the ECB appears to be having the desired effect of encouraging companies and households to borrow and increase expenditure.\nIn February 2017, the European Commission, or EC, revised its 2017 GDP forecast for the Euro Area up by 0.1% to 1.6% with growth expected to continue to be driven primarily by domestic demand. The 2018 Euro Area outlook has also been revised upwards to 1.8%, 0.1% above the November 2016 forecast. Inflation in the EU has begun to rise since the end of 2016 and is expected to rise from 0.3% in 2016 to 1.8% in 2017.\nUnemployment in the EU continued to fall, reaching 8.1% in January 2017 (down from 8.9% a year earlier), the lowest level recorded since January 2009. The EC predicts a continued improvement in the labor market in 2017 and 2018.\nThe German economy strengthened further in 2016, with GDP growth of 1.9% (an increase of 0.2% compared to 2015), driven by a combination of private consumption and resilient exports fueled by a weaker Euro. The EC forecasts that Germany will maintain this momentum through 2017 and 2018, resulting in projected GDP growth of 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively. The French economy grew by 1.2% in 2016 (0.1% lower compared to 2015) and is expected to reach 1.4% and 1.7% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The U.K. economy has performed better than generally expected since the EU referendum in June 2016, achieving 0.6% GDP growth in the fourth quarter and 2.0% growth year on year in 2016. This has likely been fueled by a combination of depreciation in the value of U.K. Pound Sterling, an increase in the Bank of England's, or BOE's, quantitative easing program by \u00a370 billion and the reduction in the interest rate to 0.25%. In light of this stronger than anticipated performance, the EC recently improved its U.K. growth outlook for 2017 by 0.5% to 1.5%. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the future of the U.K.'s relationship with the EU as well as its non-EU trading partners as the process of exiting the EU evolves.\nBeyond the U.K., upcoming elections in countries including the Netherlands, France and Germany have the potential to exacerbate the level of geopolitical uncertainty that currently exists within Europe and globally. While we continue to remain positive regarding the prospects for the region, the outcome of these events as well as the financial health of certain peripheral countries such as Greece, Italy and Portugal - including the health of their respective banking sectors and high levels of public debt - pose a potential risk to the stability of the region and its future economic growth prospects.\nDespite a strong fourth quarter (\u20ac87 billion investment volume, a 5% year-on-year increase), total European commercial real estate investment volume remained 10% below its 2015 level, reaching \u20ac251 billion in 2016. However, this was driven by a sharp decline in U.K. investment volume. Overall investment volume across Europe, excluding the U.K., actually grew by 5% year on year, continuing to reflect strong demand from investors. The office sector, which accounted for approximately 43% of overall 2016 investment volume, proved relatively resilient in 2016, showing only a 5% annual decline in volume (including the U.K.).\nQuarter on quarter investment activity rose by 26% in the U.K. during the fourth quarter. This was widely attributed to overseas investors seeking to take advantage of U.K. Pounds Sterling's devaluation since the EU referendum. However, full year 2016 U.K. investment volume remained significantly below its 2015 level falling by 28% in local currency. Germany surpassed the U.K. as the most active investment market in the second half of the year. Full year 2016 investment volume reached \u20ac53 billion, only 4% below 2015. During the year, average prime office yields across the top 7 German cities fell by approximately 59 bps to 3.6% reflecting the strongest annual yield compression witnessed during the past 10 years.\nFull year 2016 investment volume in France reached \u20ac26 million, 4% below its 2015 level. At the end of 2016, prime office yields in Greater Paris, which represented 75% of total French investment volume, reached an all-time low of 3.0%.\nOccupational demand across the major European office markets remains robust with strong take-up and decreasing vacancy rates witnessed across most major cities. This trend is expected to continue through 2017 driven by improving macroeconomic fundamentals and a limited new supply pipeline.\nOur Strategy\nWe seek to provide our stockholders with a stable and recurring cash flow for distribution supplemented by capital growth over time. Our business is predominantly focused on prime office properties located in key cities within our Core Markets. These are not only the largest economies in Europe, but the largest, most established, liquid and among the most stable office markets in Europe. We seek to utilize our established local networks to source suitable investment opportunities. We have a long term investment approach and expect to make equity investments, directly or indirectly through joint ventures.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBasis of Accounting\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and our related notes for the period prior to the Spin-off are presented on a carve-out basis and have been prepared from the historical consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows of NorthStar Realty in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe contribution of the European Real Estate Business to us has been determined to be a combination of entities under common control which results in a change in the reporting entity and requires retrospective application to our financial statements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the operations of the European Real Estate Business of NorthStar Realty transferred to us upon the Spin-off are presented as if the transferred business was our business for periods in which common control was present and at the carrying value of such assets and liabilities recorded in NorthStar Realty's historical books and records. As a result, the combined consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 was updated to include items related to the New European Investments, such as cash of $0.5 million, certain deposits of $58.6 million, related foreign exchange loss of $1.1 million and transaction costs incurred of $27.5 million. The cash, deposits paid and transaction costs incurred are recorded as net transactions with NorthStar Realty through equity.\nPrior to the Spin-off, our financial statements had not been prepared as we were not operated separately from NorthStar Realty. The consolidated financial statements for such prior periods reflect our revenues and direct expenses and include material assets and liabilities of NorthStar Realty that are specifically identifiable to the European Real Estate Business and contributed to us upon completion of the Spin-off. The consolidated financial statements for the period ended January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2015 and the combined consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 represent us prior to the Spin-off and include certain consolidated subsidiaries. Subsequent to the Spin-off, the financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis.\nIn addition, the combined consolidated financial statements include activity related to the ownership period prior to the Acquisition Date of the U.K. Complex, herein referred to as the Prior Owner Period. The year ended December 31, 2014 include activities of the U.K. Complex from January 1, 2014 to the Acquisition Date. Because the U.K. Complex was acquired from an unrelated third party on the Acquisition Date, a blackline\u201d presentation for the change in basis giving effect to purchase accounting pursuant to U.S. GAAP is presented.\nThe combined consolidated financial statements for the period from the Acquisition Date, or NorthStar Europe Period, and Prior Owner Period include an allocation of costs and expenses by NorthStar Realty related to us (primarily compensation and other general and administrative expense of $1 million) based on an estimate of expenses as if we were managed as an independent entity. This allocation method is principally based on relative headcount and management's knowledge of our operations. The amounts allocated in the accompanying combined consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the actual amount of such indirect expenses that would have been recorded had we been a separate independent entity. We believe the assumptions underlying its allocation of indirect expenses are reasonable. In addition, an estimate of management fees to our Manager was recorded for the NorthStar Europe Period as if we were managed as an independent entity. We began paying management fees to our Manager on November 1, 2015 pursuant to the terms of our management agreement with our Manager.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the combined accounts of NorthStar Realty Europe Corp., our Operating Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries. We consolidate variable interest entities, or VIEs, where we are the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities which are generally majority owned or otherwise controlled by us. All significant intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis. We base the qualitative analysis on our review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity. We reassess the initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events.\nA VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE. We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE's purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to our business activities and the other interests. We reassess the determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period. Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions.\nWe will evaluate our investments in unconsolidated ventures to determine whether they are a VIE. We analyze new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing.\nVoting Interest Entities\nA voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If we have a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated. We do not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority vote.\nWe perform on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework.\nNon-controlling Interests\nA non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined as the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to us. A non-controlling interest is required to be presented as a separate component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets and presented separately as net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI, attributable to non-controlling interests. An allocation to a non-controlling interest may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents.\nOperating Real Estate\nOperating real estate is carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Major replacements and improvements which extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their useful life. Operating real estate is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nWe account for purchases of operating real estate that qualify as business combinations using the acquisition method, where the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets such as land, building, tenant and land improvements and other identified intangibles, such as in-place leases, above/below-market leases and goodwill. Costs directly related to an acquisition deemed to be a business combination are expensed and included in transaction costs in our consolidated statements of operations.\nAssets and Liabilities Held For Sale\nOperating real estate which has met the criteria to be classified as held for sale is separately presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Such operating real estate is recorded at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value less the cost to sell net of the intangible assets associated with the asset. Once a property is determined to be held for sale, depreciation is no longer recorded. We record a gain or loss on sale of real estate when title is conveyed to the buyer and we have no substantial economic involvement with the property. If the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, we defer some or all of the gain or loss recognition by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery method, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.\nIntangible Assets and Intangible Liabilities\nWe record acquired identified intangibles, which includes intangible assets (such as value of the above-market leases, in-place leases, below-market ground leases, goodwill and other intangibles) and intangible liabilities (such as the value of below-market leases), based on estimated fair value. The value allocated to the above or below-market leases is amortized net adjustment to rental income, the value of below-market ground leases is amortized into properties - operating expense and in-place leases is amortized into depreciation and amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the respective remaining lease term.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized. We analyze goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable. We first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit, related to such goodwill, is less than the carrying amount as a basis to determine whether the two-step impairment test is necessary. The first step in the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, the second step is required to determine the amount of the impairment loss, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of such goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is derived by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit as of the measurement date, allocating the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its net assets and identifiable intangible assets. The residual amount represents the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEvents or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include (but are not limited to) issues with laws and regulations; on-going or projected negative operating income or cash flow; and/or a significant change in the occupancy rate and/or rising interest rates.\nA market approach is performed based on an income approach whereby we look at comparable properties, current market conditions, forecasts and representative transactions to validate management's expectations, where possible. The main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment, include the selection of guideline transactions, the derivation and selection of multiples and the financial metrics of the properties. The starting point for each of the reporting unit's multiples is the detailed annual plan and rent roll. The detailed planning process takes into consideration many factors including revenue growth rate and capital spending requirements, among other items which impact the individual reporting unit projections. Fair value of the reporting unit is derived using significant unobservable inputs or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. These inputs are based on internal management estimates, forecasts and judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nOperating Real Estate\nRental and escalation income from operating real estate is derived from leasing of space to various types of tenants. Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. The leases are for fixed terms of varying length and generally provide for annual rentals, subject to indexation and expense reimbursements to be paid in quarterly or monthly installments. Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in unbilled rent receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. We amortize any tenant inducements as a reduction of revenue utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the lease. Escalation income represents revenue from\ntenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes paid by us on behalf of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same period as the expenses are incurred.\nIn a situation in which a lease or leases associated with a significant tenant have been, or are expected to be, terminated early, we evaluate the remaining useful life of depreciable or amortizable assets in the asset group related to the lease that will be terminated (i.e., tenant improvements, above and below market lease intangibles, in-place lease value and leasing commissions). Based upon consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the termination, we may write-off or accelerate the depreciation and amortization associated with the asset group. Such amounts are included within depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations.\nImpairment on Investments\nOperating Real Estate\nOur real estate portfolio is reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our operating real estate may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable. A property's value is considered impaired if our estimate of the aggregate expected future undiscounted cash flow to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. In conducting this review, we consider global macroeconomic factors, real estate sector conditions, together with investment specific and other factors. To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the property over the estimated fair value of the property and recorded in impairment losses in our consolidated statements of operations.\nAn allowance for a doubtful account for a tenant receivable is established based on a periodic review of aged receivables resulting from estimated losses due to the inability of a tenant to make required rent and other payments contractually due. Additionally, we establish, on a current basis, an allowance for future tenant credit losses on unbilled rent receivable based on an evaluation of the collectability of such amounts.\nDerivatives\nWe seek to use derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. The change in fair value for a derivative is recorded in earnings.\nOur derivative instruments do not qualify as hedges under U.S. GAAP.\nForeign Currency\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is a foreign currency are translated using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are translated into U.S. dollars using the average currency exchange rate in effect during the period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated OCI.\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are remeasured using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the average currency exchange rate in effect during the period. The resulting foreign currency remeasurement adjustment is recorded in unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting update requiring a company to recognize as revenue the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The accounting standard update will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance currently promulgated by U.S. GAAP. In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. The effective date of the new revenue standard for us will be January 1, 2018. Leases are specifically excluded from this guidance and will be governed by the applicable lease codification; however, this update may have implications in certain variable payment terms included in lease agreements and in sale and leaseback transactions. We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the update on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that changes the rules regarding consolidation. The pronouncement eliminates specialized guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities and removes the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds. The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter 2016 and determined our Operating Partnership is considered a VIE. We are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE's assets can be used for purposes other than the settlement of the VIE's obligations and our partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest. In addition, we identified each of our properties that have non-controlling interests as VIEs. These entities are VIEs because the non-controlling interests do not have substantive kick-out\nor participating rights and we are the primary beneficiary. As such, this standard resulted in the identification of additional VIEs, however it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e., lessees and lessors). The update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The update is expected to result in the recognition of a right-to-use asset and related liability to account for the Company's future obligations under its ground lease arrangements for which it is the lessee. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining contractual payments under the Company's ground lease agreements are discussed in Note 11. Additionally, the new update will require that lessees and lessors capitalize, as initial direct costs, only those costs that are incurred due to the execution of a lease. Under this guidance, allocated payroll costs and other costs that are incurred regardless of whether the lease is obtained will no longer be capitalized as initial direct costs and instead will be expensed as incurred. Lessors will continue to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The new guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance clarifying that an assessment of whether an embedded contingent put or call option is clearly and closely related to a borrowing requires only an analysis of the four-step decision sequence. Additionally, entities are not required to separately assess whether the contingency itself is clearly and closely related. Entities are required to apply the guidance to existing instruments in scope using a modified retrospective transition method as of the period of adoption. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years. We have concluded that this guidance will not have any impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends several aspects of the accounting for equity-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statements of cash flows. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We will adopt the new guidance prospectively on January 1, 2017 and do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes the impairment model for most financial instruments by requiring companies to recognize an allowance for expected losses, rather than incurred losses as required currently by the other-than-temporary impairment model. The guidance will apply to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures (e.g., loan commitments). The new guidance is effective for reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2019 and will be applied as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued guidance that makes eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The new guidance requires adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case we would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. Entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to clarify the definition of a business under ASC 805. This new standard clarifies the definition of a business and provides a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and\ninterim periods within those years, beginning December 15, 2017. The amendments in this update will be applied on a prospective basis. We expect that acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate will not meet the revised definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e. land, buildings, and related intangible assets).\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance which removes Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The guidance is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nThe following presents a summary of our activity for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2016 represents our results of operations following the Spin-off and the first full year of activity as a stand-alone company.

Interest expense was approximately 14% lower in 2016 as a result of the refinancing of certain mortgage notes. Unrealized gains (loss) on investments and other increased due to the movements in foreign exchange rates on the interest rate caps. Realized gains (loss) on investments and other increased due to the write-off of the deferred financing costs related to the refinancing in 2015.\nRefer to Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d Note 12 Quarterly Financial Information\u201d for more information related to the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nRevenues\nRental Income\nRental income consists of rental revenue in our real estate segment. Rental income increased $23.3 million, primarily due to 2016 being the first full year of activity and leases signed in 2016, offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016 and the vacancy of a significant tenant in the Trianon Tower in the fourth quarter 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 27,000 square meters of leases were signed and renegotiated in our real estate segment generating a revenue increase of $5 million. Occupancy in our Core Market for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was 92% compared to 94% for the three months ended December 31, 2015 mainly due to the vacancy in the Trianon Tower.\nEscalation Income\nEscalation income consists of tenant recoveries in our real estate segment. Escalation income increased $6.4 million, primarily due to 2016 being the first full year of activity and leases signed in 2016, offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016. There is a corresponding increase in properties operating expenses and a majority of these costs are recovered by us.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue is principally related to lease termination fees in our real estate segment. Other revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the early termination of two tenants whose spaces were subsequently re-let.\nExpenses\nProperties - Operating Expenses\nProperties - operating expenses increased $9.3 million due to 2016 being the first full year of activity and leases signed in 2016, offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016 and a decrease in asset management fees in the SEB Portfolio in our real estate segment. There is a corresponding increase in escalation income and a majority of these costs are recovered from our tenants.\nReal estate properties - operating expenses in 2016 represents $4.4 million relating to repairs and maintenance and $31.7 million relating to escalation expense.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $5.3 million due to 2016 being the first full year of activity, offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016 and the refinancing of certain mortgage notes in our real estate segment and the repayment of the Senior Notes in our corporate segment.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relate to costs associated with exploring potential transactions in our real estate segment and costs related to the Mergers in our corporate segment. Transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily represented expenses such as real estate transfer tax and professional fees related to the acquisition of our New European Investments in our real estate segment and the Spin-off in our corporate segment.\nImpairment losses\nImpairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to impairment of one of our held-for-sale assets in our real estate segment, which sold for less than the initial carrying value subsequent to quarter ended June 30, 2016. The initial carrying value was based on the initial purchase price allocation of the asset, which utilized different assumptions than the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation, primarily being a longer holding period. The sale price of the asset was in line with the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation. Impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to impairment of goodwill on one reporting unit which management deemed to be impaired in our real estate segment.\nManagement Fee, Related Party\nManagement fee, related party relates to the management fee incurred to our Manager in our corporate segment (refer to Related Parties Arrangements\u201d below for more information). The management contract with our Manager commenced on November 1, 2015.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses primarily represent third-party service provider fees such as audit and legal fees and other compliance related fees related to portfolio management of our real estate segment. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to the full year impact of owning and managing the New European Investments. We expect the benefit of the cost savings from the asset sales in 2017 due to timing of the unwind of the structures and the reduction in the number of entities.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses are principally incurred in our corporate segment. The year ended December 31, 2016 represents a full year of operating as a stand-alone company, which includes the impact of the implementation of an internal control environment and includes an allocation of general and administrative expenses from our Manager of $0.2 million. The year ended December 31, 2015 represent an allocation of certain costs and expenses related to activities for the launch of our European Real Estate Business prior to the Spin-off.\nCompensation Expense\nCompensation expense is comprised of time-based and performance equity-based based awards in our corporate segment. We began to incur compensation expense upon the Spin-off in November 2015. The year ended December 31, 2016 changes do not take into account the impact of the vesting as a result of the Mergers (refer to Item 8 Compensation Expense\u201d for more information).\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased due to 2016 being the first full year of activity, offset by the disposals of 18 properties during 2016 and assets being reclassified into held for sale in our real estate segment.\nOther Income (Loss)\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nUnrealized gain (loss) on investments and other is primarily related to the non-cash change in fair value of derivative instruments. The increase in the foreign currency forwards used to hedge projected net property level cash flows related to the strengthened U.S. dollar against the U.K. Pound Sterling and the Euro. The decrease on the interest rate caps relates to the movement in interest rate spreads within Europe.\nThe following table presents a summary of unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Rental and escalation income increased $110.0 million, primarily due to the acquisition of our New European Investments in 2015 in our real estate segment. The fourth quarter 2015 is the first quarter that reflects a full quarter of activity for our European Real Estate Business.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue is principally related to lease cancellations in our real estate segment.\nExpenses\nProperties - Operating Expenses\nProperties - operating expenses increased $22.3 million due to the acquisition of our New European Investments in 2015 in our real estate segment.

Interest expense for 2014 relates to the mortgage notes payable associated with the Prior Owner Period that was repaid upon acquisition of the U.K. Complex in September 2014.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily represented expenses such as real estate transfer tax and professional fees related to the acquisition of our New European Investments in our real estate segment and the Spin-off in our corporate segment.

In addition to investment-specific financings, we may use and have used credit facilities and repaid facilities on a shorter term basis and public and private, secured and unsecured debt issuances on a longer term basis. Our current primary liquidity needs are to fund:\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our operating expenses and investment activities, including the repurchase of our common stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>acquisitions of our target assets and related ongoing commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>distributions to our stockholders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>principal and interest payments on our borrowings; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>income tax liabilities of taxable REIT subsidiaries and we are subject to limitations as a REIT.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our current primary sources of liquidity are:\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>net proceeds from asset sales;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>financings secured by our assets such as mortgage notes, long-term senior and subordinate corporate capital such as revolving credit facilities, senior term loans, senior notes, senior exchangeable notes and perpetual preferred stock and common stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cash on hand;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cash flow generated from our investments, both from operations and return of capital; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>investment-level financing.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We seek to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, including the repayment of borrowings and our investment funding needs, through existing cash resources, issuance of debt or equity capital, return of capital from investments and the liquidation or refinancing of assets. Nonetheless, our ability to meet a long-term (beyond one year) liquidity requirement may be subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing. Any decision by our lenders and investors to provide us with financing will depend upon a number of factors, such as our compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements, our financial performance, industry or market trends, the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions, such lenders' and investors' resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities.\nAs a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders, including taxable income where we do not receive corresponding cash, and we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and to avoid federal income tax and the non-deductible excise tax. On a quarterly basis, our board of directors determines an appropriate common stock dividend based upon numerous factors, including CAD, REIT qualification requirements, availability of existing cash balances, borrowing capacity under existing credit agreements, access to cash in the capital markets and other financing sources, our view of our ability to realize gains in the future through appreciation in the value of our assets, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impact our business or prospects. Future dividend levels are subject to adjustment based upon our evaluation of the factors described above, as well as other factors that our board of directors may, from time-to-time, deem relevant to consider when determining an appropriate common stock dividend.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, NorthStar Realty provided us with an initial capitalization of $250 million. In addition, in November 2015, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock. That authorization expired in November 2016 and at such time our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $100 million of its outstanding common stock. The authorization expires in November 2017, unless otherwise extended by our board of directors. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 6 million shares of our common stock for $59 million. From November 2015 through December 31, 2016, we repurchased 9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $100 million.\nWe currently believe that our existing sources of funds should be adequate for purposes of meeting our short-term liquidity needs. We expect our contractual rental income is sufficient to meet our expected capital expenditures, interest expense, property operating and general and administrative expenses and common dividends declared by us. We may seek to raise additional capital in order to finance new acquisitions. Unrestricted cash as of March 13, 2017 was approximately $55.7 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands).\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2016 represents our results of operations following the Spin-off and the first full year of activity as a stand-alone company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31, 2015 represents: (i) our results of operations following the Spin-off and two months of activity as a stand-alone company; and (ii) our results of operations of the European Real Estate Business as if the transferred business was the business for the periods in which common control was present and an allocation of costs related to us for the period from January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The period from January 1, 2014 to September 15, 2014 represents: (i) the Prior Owner Period results of operations, which represents the ownership period of a third party (refer to Critical Accounting Policy\u201d below for more information); and (ii) an allocation of costs related to the launch of the European Real Estate Business.

The increase was primarily related to an increase in net cash flow from operating activities of our New European Investments in 2015, offset by costs and expenses from activities related to the launch of our European Real Estate Business in 2014 and costs relating to acquiring our New European Investments.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to cash used in investing activities of $151.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in net cash used was related to NorthStar Realty's acquisition of our New European Investments in 2015.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $2.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $188.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash flow provided by the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to $1.2 billion for the financing by NorthStar Realty for the acquisition of our New European Investments in 2015, $250.0 million from the contribution of NorthStar Realty, $340.0 million for the issuance of the Senior Notes, offset by $38.0 million for the retirement of our shares, $31.0 million for the new derivatives and $9.6 million for the payment of dividends.

The annualized fee payable to our Manager is approximately $14 million as of December 31, 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRelated Party Arrangements\nColony NorthStar, Inc.\nThe management agreement with our Manager is for an initial term of 20 years and provides for a base management fee and incentive fee. The management contract with our Manager commenced on November 1, 2015, and as such, there were no management fees incurred for the period from January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2014.\nBase Management Fee\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $14.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, related to the base management fee. The base management fee to our Manager could increase subsequent to December 31, 2016 by an amount equal to 1.5% per annum of the sum of:\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>any equity we issue in exchange or conversion of exchangeable or stock-settlable notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>any other issuances by us of common equity, preferred equity or other forms of equity, including but not limited to limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership, which are structured as profits interests, or LTIP units (excluding units issued to us and equity-based compensation, but including issuances related to an acquisition, investment, joint venture or partnership); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>cumulative CAD, if any, in excess of cumulative distributions paid on common stock, LTIP Units or other equity awards which began with our fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Incentive Fee\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not incur an incentive fee. The incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in cash, equal to:\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the product of: (a) 15% and (b) our CAD before such incentive fee, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter, of any amount in excess of $0.30 per share and up to $0.36 per share; plus\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the product of: (a) 25% and (b) our CAD before such incentive fee, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter, of any amount in excess of $0.36 per share;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>multiplied by our weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Weighted average shares represents the number of shares of our common stock, LTIP Units or other equity-based awards (with some exclusions), outstanding on a daily weighted average basis. With respect to the base management fee, all equity issuances are allocated on a daily weighted average basis during the fiscal quarter of issuance. With respect to the incentive fee, such amounts will be appropriately adjusted from time to time to take into account the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction.\nAdditional Management Agreement Terms\nIf we were to spin-off any asset or business in the future, such entity would be managed by our Manager on terms substantially similar to those set forth in the management agreement between us and our Manager. The management agreement further provides\nthat the aggregate base management fee in place immediately after any future spin-off will not be less than our aggregate base management fee in place immediately prior to such spin-off.\nOur management agreement with our Manager provides that in the event of a change of control of our Manager or other event that could be deemed an assignment of the management agreement, we will consider such assignment in good faith and not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay our consent. The management agreement further provides that we anticipate consent would be granted for an assignment or deemed assignment to a party with expertise in commercial real estate and over $10 billion of assets under management. The management agreement also provides that, notwithstanding anything in the agreement to the contrary, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, rules and regulations, in connection with any merger, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, change of control, reorganization, consolidation or any similar transaction of us or our Manager, directly or indirectly, the surviving entity will succeed to the terms of the management agreement.\nPayment of Costs and Expenses and Expense Allocation\nWe are responsible for all of our direct costs and expenses and reimburse our Manager for costs and expenses incurred by our Manager on our behalf. In addition, our Manager may allocate indirect costs to us related to employees, occupancy and other general and administrative costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limitations contained in, our management agreement with our Manager, or the G&A Allocation. Our management agreement with our Manager provides that the amount of the G&A Allocation will not exceed the following: (i) 20% of the combined total of: (a) our and NorthStar Realty's, or the NorthStar Listed Companies', general and administrative expenses as reported in their consolidated financial statements excluding (1) equity-based compensation expense, (2) non-recurring items, (3) fees payable to our Manager under the terms of the applicable management agreement and (4) any allocation of expenses to the NorthStar Listed Companies, or NorthStar Listed Companies' G&A; and (b) our Manager's general and administrative expenses as reported in its consolidated financial statements, excluding equity-based compensation expense and adding back any costs or expenses allocated to any managed company of our Manager; less (ii) the NorthStar Listed Companies' G&A. The G&A Allocation may include our allocable share of our Manager's compensation and benefit costs associated with dedicated or partially dedicated personnel who spend all or a portion of their time managing our affairs, based upon the percentage of time devoted by such personnel to our affairs. The G&A Allocation may also include rental and occupancy, technology, office supplies, travel and entertainment and other general and administrative costs and expenses, which may be allocated based on various methodologies, such as weighted average employee count or the percentage of time devoted by personnel to such NorthStar Listed Companies' affairs. In addition, we will pay directly or reimburse our Manager for an allocable portion of any severance paid pursuant to any employment, consulting or similar service agreements in effect between our Manager and any of its executives, employees or other service providers.\nIn connection with the Spin-off and the related agreements, the NorthStar Listed Companies' obligation to reimburse our Manager for the G&A Allocation and any severance are shared among the NorthStar Listed Companies, at our Manager's discretion, and the 20% cap on the G&A Allocation, as described above, applies on an aggregate basis to the NorthStar Listed Companies. Our Manager currently determined to allocate these amounts based on assets under management.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Manager allocated $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, to us. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Manager did not allocate any severance to us.\nAs a result of the Mergers, the management agreement between our Manager and NorthStar Realty terminated, such that we remain as the sole NorthStar Listed Company.\nIn addition, the management agreement provides that, we, together with NorthStar Realty and any company spun-off from us or NorthStar Realty, shall pay directly or reimburse our Manager for up to 50% of any long-term bonus or other compensation that our Manager's compensation committee determines shall be paid and/or settled in the form of equity and/or equity-based compensation to executives, employees and service providers of our Manager during any year. Subject to this limitation and limitations contained in any applicable management agreement between our Manager and NorthStar Realty or any company spun-off from us or NorthStar Realty, the amount paid by us, NorthStar Realty and any company spun-off from us or NorthStar Realty will be determined by our Manager in its discretion. At the discretion of our Manager's compensation committee, this compensation may be granted in shares of our restricted stock, restricted stock units, LTIP Units or other forms of equity compensation or stock-based awards; provided that if at any time a sufficient number of shares of our common stock are not available for issuance under our equity compensation plan, such compensation shall be paid in the form of RSUs, LTIP Units or other securities that may be settled in cash. Our equity compensation for each year may be allocated on an individual-by-individual basis at the discretion of our Manager compensation committee and, as long as the aggregate amount of the equity compensation for such year does not exceed the limits set forth in the management agreement, the proportion of any particular individual's equity compensation may be greater or less than 50%.\nOur Manager Purchase of Common Stock\nIn June 2016, our Manager purchased 0.2 million shares of our common stock through open market purchases for an aggregate purchase price of $2.3 million.\nRecent Developments\nDividends\nOn March 8, 2017, we declared a dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock. The common stock dividend will be paid on March 24, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 20, 2017.\nSales\nSubsequent to December 31, 2016, we sold one non-core asset in the Internos Portfolio with a carrying value of $17.2 million for $23.6 million.\nMergers\nOn January 10, 2017, our external manager, NSAM completed the tri-party merger with NorthStar Realty and Colony under which the companies combined in an all-stock merger of equals transaction to create a diversified real estate and investment management company. Under the terms of the merger agreement, NSAM, Colony and NorthStar Realty, through a series of transactions, merged with and into NSAM, which was renamed Colony NorthStar. Colony NorthStar is a leading global equity REIT with an embedded investment management platform. As a result of the Mergers, substantially all restricted shares and RSUs vested and only RSUs subject to performance-based hurdles remain outstanding.\nInflation\nVirtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other factors influence our performance significantly more than inflation does. A change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates may correlate with inflation rates. With the exception of the United Kingdom, generally rent is adjusted annually based on local consumer price indices. In the United Kingdom, rent is typically subject to an upward only rent review usually every three to five years.\nRefer to", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Our objective is to provide our stockholders with stable and recurring cash flow supplemented by capital growth over time. We commenced operations on November 1, 2015 following the spin-off by NorthStar Realty of its European real estate business (excluding its European healthcare properties) into a separate publicly-traded company, NorthStar Europe, a Maryland corporation, or the Spin-off.\nUpon completion of the Spin-off, NorthStar Realty contributed: (i) its business activities related to the U.K. Complex, acquired on September 16, 2014; (ii) the New European Investments; and (iii) certain other assets and liabilities related to NorthStar Realty's European real estate business, herein collectively referred to as the European Real Estate Business.\nOn November 2, 2015, our common stock began trading on the NYSE under the symbol NRE.\u201d We are externally managed and advised by an affiliate of our Manager. Substantially all of our assets, directly or indirectly, are held by, and we conduct our operations, directly or indirectly, through our Operating Partnership. We have elected to be taxed and will continue to conduct our operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nSignificant Developments\nSales Initiatives\nIn 2016, we announced a strategy to focus on prime office properties located in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France. As a result, we undertook a sales initiative, selling 22 properties as of March 1, 2017 and realizing $380 million of net proceeds. Consequently, we no longer operate in Belgium, Italy or Sweden. In 2017, we expect to continue executing on our sales initiatives primarily with the goal of maximizing long-term stockholder value.\nSenior Notes\nIn 2016, we repurchased approximately $272.3 million of the Senior Notes and settled the remaining Senior Notes in cash at maturity.\nMergers Agreement among NSAM, NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc.\nOn January 10, 2017, our external manager, NSAM completed a tri-party merger with NorthStar Realty and Colony under which the companies combined in an all-stock merger of equals transaction to create a diversified real estate and investment management company. Under the terms of the merger agreement, NSAM, Colony and NorthStar Realty, through a series of transactions, merged with and into NSAM, which was renamed Colony NorthStar. Colony NorthStar is a leading global equity REIT with an embedded investment management platform.\nSummary of Business\nOur primary business line is European real estate. We are predominantly focused on prime office properties located in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France.

Our income is primarily derived through the difference between the revenue and the operating and financing costs of our investments. We may also continue to acquire investments that generate attractive returns without any leverage.\nProfitability and Performance Metrics\nWe calculate cash available for distribution, or CAD, and net operating income, or NOI as metrics to evaluate the profitability and performance of our business (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a description of these metrics).\nOutlook and Recent Trends\nThe European economy concluded another positive year of growth in 2016. Fourth quarter Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, in the European Union, or the EU, and the Euro Area grew by 1.9% and 1.7% year on year, respectively. This represented the fourteenth consecutive quarter of growth in the Eurozone which outpaced the U.S. economy in 2016. In December of 2016, the European Central Bank, or ECB, extended its quantitative easing program until the end of 2017 while reducing the average volume of asset purchases from \u20ac80 billion to \u20ac60 billion per month from April 2017. The monetary stimulus provided by the ECB appears to be having the desired effect of encouraging companies and households to borrow and increase expenditure.\nIn February 2017, the European Commission, or EC, revised its 2017 GDP forecast for the Euro Area up by 0.1% to 1.6% with growth expected to continue to be driven primarily by domestic demand. The 2018 Euro Area outlook has also been revised upwards to 1.8%, 0.1% above the November 2016 forecast. Inflation in the EU has begun to rise since the end of 2016 and is expected to rise from 0.3% in 2016 to 1.8% in 2017.\nUnemployment in the EU continued to fall, reaching 8.1% in January 2017 (down from 8.9% a year earlier), the lowest level recorded since January 2009. The EC predicts a continued improvement in the labor market in 2017 and 2018.\nThe German economy strengthened further in 2016, with GDP growth of 1.9% (an increase of 0.2% compared to 2015), driven by a combination of private consumption and resilient exports fueled by a weaker Euro. The EC forecasts that Germany will maintain this momentum through 2017 and 2018, resulting in projected GDP growth of 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively. The French economy grew by 1.2% in 2016 (0.1% lower compared to 2015) and is expected to reach 1.4% and 1.7% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The U.K. economy has performed better than generally expected since the EU referendum in June 2016, achieving 0.6% GDP growth in the fourth quarter and 2.0% growth year on year in 2016. This has likely been fueled by a combination of depreciation in the value of U.K. Pound Sterling, an increase in the Bank of England's, or BOE's, quantitative easing program by \u00a370 billion and the reduction in the interest rate to 0.25%. In light of this stronger than anticipated performance, the EC recently improved its U.K. growth outlook for 2017 by 0.5% to 1.5%. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the future of the U.K.'s relationship with the EU as well as its non-EU trading partners as the process of exiting the EU evolves.\nBeyond the U.K., upcoming elections in countries including the Netherlands, France and Germany have the potential to exacerbate the level of geopolitical uncertainty that currently exists within Europe and globally. While we continue to remain positive regarding the prospects for the region, the outcome of these events as well as the financial health of certain peripheral countries such as Greece, Italy and Portugal - including the health of their respective banking sectors and high levels of public debt - pose a potential risk to the stability of the region and its future economic growth prospects.\nDespite a strong fourth quarter (\u20ac87 billion investment volume, a 5% year-on-year increase), total European commercial real estate investment volume remained 10% below its 2015 level, reaching \u20ac251 billion in 2016. However, this was driven by a sharp decline in U.K. investment volume. Overall investment volume across Europe, excluding the U.K., actually grew by 5% year on year, continuing to reflect strong demand from investors. The office sector, which accounted for approximately 43% of overall 2016 investment volume, proved relatively resilient in 2016, showing only a 5% annual decline in volume (including the U.K.).\nQuarter on quarter investment activity rose by 26% in the U.K. during the fourth quarter. This was widely attributed to overseas investors seeking to take advantage of U.K. Pounds Sterling's devaluation since the EU referendum. However, full year 2016 U.K. investment volume remained significantly below its 2015 level falling by 28% in local currency. Germany surpassed the U.K. as the most active investment market in the second half of the year. Full year 2016 investment volume reached \u20ac53 billion, only 4% below 2015. During the year, average prime office yields across the top 7 German cities fell by approximately 59 bps to 3.6% reflecting the strongest annual yield compression witnessed during the past 10 years.\nFull year 2016 investment volume in France reached \u20ac26 million, 4% below its 2015 level. At the end of 2016, prime office yields in Greater Paris, which represented 75% of total French investment volume, reached an all-time low of 3.0%.\nOccupational demand across the major European office markets remains robust with strong take-up and decreasing vacancy rates witnessed across most major cities. This trend is expected to continue through 2017 driven by improving macroeconomic fundamentals and a limited new supply pipeline.\nOur Strategy\nWe seek to provide our stockholders with a stable and recurring cash flow for distribution supplemented by capital growth over time. Our business is predominantly focused on prime office properties located in key cities within our Core Markets. These are not only the largest economies in Europe, but the largest, most established, liquid and among the most stable office markets in Europe. We seek to utilize our established local networks to source suitable investment opportunities. We have a long term investment approach and expect to make equity investments, directly or indirectly through joint ventures.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBasis of Accounting\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and our related notes for the period prior to the Spin-off are presented on a carve-out basis and have been prepared from the historical consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows of NorthStar Realty in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe contribution of the European Real Estate Business to us has been determined to be a combination of entities under common control which results in a change in the reporting entity and requires retrospective application to our financial statements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the operations of the European Real Estate Business of NorthStar Realty transferred to us upon the Spin-off are presented as if the transferred business was our business for periods in which common control was present and at the carrying value of such assets and liabilities recorded in NorthStar Realty's historical books and records. As a result, the combined consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 was updated to include items related to the New European Investments, such as cash of $0.5 million, certain deposits of $58.6 million, related foreign exchange loss of $1.1 million and transaction costs incurred of $27.5 million. The cash, deposits paid and transaction costs incurred are recorded as net transactions with NorthStar Realty through equity.\nPrior to the Spin-off, our financial statements had not been prepared as we were not operated separately from NorthStar Realty. The consolidated financial statements for such prior periods reflect our revenues and direct expenses and include material assets and liabilities of NorthStar Realty that are specifically identifiable to the European Real Estate Business and contributed to us upon completion of the Spin-off. The consolidated financial statements for the period ended January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2015 and the combined consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 represent us prior to the Spin-off and include certain consolidated subsidiaries. Subsequent to the Spin-off, the financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis.\nIn addition, the combined consolidated financial statements include activity related to the ownership period prior to the Acquisition Date of the U.K. Complex, herein referred to as the Prior Owner Period. The year ended December 31, 2014 include activities of the U.K. Complex from January 1, 2014 to the Acquisition Date. Because the U.K. Complex was acquired from an unrelated third party on the Acquisition Date, a blackline\u201d presentation for the change in basis giving effect to purchase accounting pursuant to U.S. GAAP is presented.\nThe combined consolidated financial statements for the period from the Acquisition Date, or NorthStar Europe Period, and Prior Owner Period include an allocation of costs and expenses by NorthStar Realty related to us (primarily compensation and other general and administrative expense of $1 million) based on an estimate of expenses as if we were managed as an independent entity. This allocation method is principally based on relative headcount and management's knowledge of our operations. The amounts allocated in the accompanying combined consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the actual amount of such indirect expenses that would have been recorded had we been a separate independent entity. We believe the assumptions underlying its allocation of indirect expenses are reasonable. In addition, an estimate of management fees to our Manager was recorded for the NorthStar Europe Period as if we were managed as an independent entity. We began paying management fees to our Manager on November 1, 2015 pursuant to the terms of our management agreement with our Manager.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the combined accounts of NorthStar Realty Europe Corp., our Operating Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries. We consolidate variable interest entities, or VIEs, where we are the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities which are generally majority owned or otherwise controlled by us. All significant intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis. We base the qualitative analysis on our review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity. We reassess the initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events.\nA VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE. We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE's purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to our business activities and the other interests. We reassess the determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period. Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions.\nWe will evaluate our investments in unconsolidated ventures to determine whether they are a VIE. We analyze new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing.\nVoting Interest Entities\nA voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If we have a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated. We do not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority vote.\nWe perform on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework.\nNon-controlling Interests\nA non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined as the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to us. A non-controlling interest is required to be presented as a separate component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets and presented separately as net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI, attributable to non-controlling interests. An allocation to a non-controlling interest may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents.\nOperating Real Estate\nOperating real estate is carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Major replacements and improvements which extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their useful life. Operating real estate is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nWe account for purchases of operating real estate that qualify as business combinations using the acquisition method, where the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets such as land, building, tenant and land improvements and other identified intangibles, such as in-place leases, above/below-market leases and goodwill. Costs directly related to an acquisition deemed to be a business combination are expensed and included in transaction costs in our consolidated statements of operations.\nAssets and Liabilities Held For Sale\nOperating real estate which has met the criteria to be classified as held for sale is separately presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Such operating real estate is recorded at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value less the cost to sell net of the intangible assets associated with the asset. Once a property is determined to be held for sale, depreciation is no longer recorded. We record a gain or loss on sale of real estate when title is conveyed to the buyer and we have no substantial economic involvement with the property. If the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, we defer some or all of the gain or loss recognition by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery method, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.\nIntangible Assets and Intangible Liabilities\nWe record acquired identified intangibles, which includes intangible assets (such as value of the above-market leases, in-place leases, below-market ground leases, goodwill and other intangibles) and intangible liabilities (such as the value of below-market leases), based on estimated fair value. The value allocated to the above or below-market leases is amortized net adjustment to rental income, the value of below-market ground leases is amortized into properties - operating expense and in-place leases is amortized into depreciation and amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the respective remaining lease term.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized. We analyze goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable. We first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit, related to such goodwill, is less than the carrying amount as a basis to determine whether the two-step impairment test is necessary. The first step in the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, the second step is required to determine the amount of the impairment loss, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of such goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is derived by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit as of the measurement date, allocating the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its net assets and identifiable intangible assets. The residual amount represents the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEvents or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include (but are not limited to) issues with laws and regulations; on-going or projected negative operating income or cash flow; and/or a significant change in the occupancy rate and/or rising interest rates.\nA market approach is performed based on an income approach whereby we look at comparable properties, current market conditions, forecasts and representative transactions to validate management's expectations, where possible. The main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment, include the selection of guideline transactions, the derivation and selection of multiples and the financial metrics of the properties. The starting point for each of the reporting unit's multiples is the detailed annual plan and rent roll. The detailed planning process takes into consideration many factors including revenue growth rate and capital spending requirements, among other items which impact the individual reporting unit projections. Fair value of the reporting unit is derived using significant unobservable inputs or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. These inputs are based on internal management estimates, forecasts and judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nOperating Real Estate\nRental and escalation income from operating real estate is derived from leasing of space to various types of tenants. Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. The leases are for fixed terms of varying length and generally provide for annual rentals, subject to indexation and expense reimbursements to be paid in quarterly or monthly installments. Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in unbilled rent receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. We amortize any tenant inducements as a reduction of revenue utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the lease. Escalation income represents revenue from\ntenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes paid by us on behalf of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same period as the expenses are incurred.\nIn a situation in which a lease or leases associated with a significant tenant have been, or are expected to be, terminated early, we evaluate the remaining useful life of depreciable or amortizable assets in the asset group related to the lease that will be terminated (i.e., tenant improvements, above and below market lease intangibles, in-place lease value and leasing commissions). Based upon consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the termination, we may write-off or accelerate the depreciation and amortization associated with the asset group. Such amounts are included within depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations.\nImpairment on Investments\nOperating Real Estate\nOur real estate portfolio is reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our operating real estate may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable. A property's value is considered impaired if our estimate of the aggregate expected future undiscounted cash flow to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. In conducting this review, we consider global macroeconomic factors, real estate sector conditions, together with investment specific and other factors. To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the property over the estimated fair value of the property and recorded in impairment losses in our consolidated statements of operations.\nAn allowance for a doubtful account for a tenant receivable is established based on a periodic review of aged receivables resulting from estimated losses due to the inability of a tenant to make required rent and other payments contractually due. Additionally, we establish, on a current basis, an allowance for future tenant credit losses on unbilled rent receivable based on an evaluation of the collectability of such amounts.\nDerivatives\nWe seek to use derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. The change in fair value for a derivative is recorded in earnings.\nOur derivative instruments do not qualify as hedges under U.S. GAAP.\nForeign Currency\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is a foreign currency are translated using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are translated into U.S. dollars using the average currency exchange rate in effect during the period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated OCI.\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are remeasured using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the average currency exchange rate in effect during the period. The resulting foreign currency remeasurement adjustment is recorded in unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting update requiring a company to recognize as revenue the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The accounting standard update will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance currently promulgated by U.S. GAAP. In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. The effective date of the new revenue standard for us will be January 1, 2018. Leases are specifically excluded from this guidance and will be governed by the applicable lease codification; however, this update may have implications in certain variable payment terms included in lease agreements and in sale and leaseback transactions. We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the update on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that changes the rules regarding consolidation. The pronouncement eliminates specialized guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities and removes the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds. The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter 2016 and determined our Operating Partnership is considered a VIE. We are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE's assets can be used for purposes other than the settlement of the VIE's obligations and our partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest. In addition, we identified each of our properties that have non-controlling interests as VIEs. These entities are VIEs because the non-controlling interests do not have substantive kick-out\nor participating rights and we are the primary beneficiary. As such, this standard resulted in the identification of additional VIEs, however it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e., lessees and lessors). The update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The update is expected to result in the recognition of a right-to-use asset and related liability to account for the Company's future obligations under its ground lease arrangements for which it is the lessee. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining contractual payments under the Company's ground lease agreements are discussed in Note 11. Additionally, the new update will require that lessees and lessors capitalize, as initial direct costs, only those costs that are incurred due to the execution of a lease. Under this guidance, allocated payroll costs and other costs that are incurred regardless of whether the lease is obtained will no longer be capitalized as initial direct costs and instead will be expensed as incurred. Lessors will continue to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The new guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance clarifying that an assessment of whether an embedded contingent put or call option is clearly and closely related to a borrowing requires only an analysis of the four-step decision sequence. Additionally, entities are not required to separately assess whether the contingency itself is clearly and closely related. Entities are required to apply the guidance to existing instruments in scope using a modified retrospective transition method as of the period of adoption. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years. We have concluded that this guidance will not have any impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends several aspects of the accounting for equity-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statements of cash flows. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We will adopt the new guidance prospectively on January 1, 2017 and do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes the impairment model for most financial instruments by requiring companies to recognize an allowance for expected losses, rather than incurred losses as required currently by the other-than-temporary impairment model. The guidance will apply to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures (e.g., loan commitments). The new guidance is effective for reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2019 and will be applied as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued guidance that makes eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The new guidance requires adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case we would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. Entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to clarify the definition of a business under ASC 805. This new standard clarifies the definition of a business and provides a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and\ninterim periods within those years, beginning December 15, 2017. The amendments in this update will be applied on a prospective basis. We expect that acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate will not meet the revised definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e. land, buildings, and related intangible assets).\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance which removes Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The guidance is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nThe following presents a summary of our activity for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2016 represents our results of operations following the Spin-off and the first full year of activity as a stand-alone company.

Interest expense was approximately 14% lower in 2016 as a result of the refinancing of certain mortgage notes. Unrealized gains (loss) on investments and other increased due to the movements in foreign exchange rates on the interest rate caps. Realized gains (loss) on investments and other increased due to the write-off of the deferred financing costs related to the refinancing in 2015.\nRefer to Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d Note 12 Quarterly Financial Information\u201d for more information related to the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nRevenues\nRental Income\nRental income consists of rental revenue in our real estate segment. Rental income increased $23.3 million, primarily due to 2016 being the first full year of activity and leases signed in 2016, offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016 and the vacancy of a significant tenant in the Trianon Tower in the fourth quarter 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 27,000 square meters of leases were signed and renegotiated in our real estate segment generating a revenue increase of $5 million. Occupancy in our Core Market for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was 92% compared to 94% for the three months ended December 31, 2015 mainly due to the vacancy in the Trianon Tower.\nEscalation Income\nEscalation income consists of tenant recoveries in our real estate segment. Escalation income increased $6.4 million, primarily due to 2016 being the first full year of activity and leases signed in 2016, offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016. There is a corresponding increase in properties operating expenses and a majority of these costs are recovered by us.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue is principally related to lease termination fees in our real estate segment. Other revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the early termination of two tenants whose spaces were subsequently re-let.\nExpenses\nProperties - Operating Expenses\nProperties - operating expenses increased $9.3 million due to 2016 being the first full year of activity and leases signed in 2016, offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016 and a decrease in asset management fees in the SEB Portfolio in our real estate segment. There is a corresponding increase in escalation income and a majority of these costs are recovered from our tenants.\nReal estate properties - operating expenses in 2016 represents $4.4 million relating to repairs and maintenance and $31.7 million relating to escalation expense.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $5.3 million due to 2016 being the first full year of activity, offset by the disposal of 18 properties during 2016 and the refinancing of certain mortgage notes in our real estate segment and the repayment of the Senior Notes in our corporate segment.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relate to costs associated with exploring potential transactions in our real estate segment and costs related to the Mergers in our corporate segment. Transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily represented expenses such as real estate transfer tax and professional fees related to the acquisition of our New European Investments in our real estate segment and the Spin-off in our corporate segment.\nImpairment losses\nImpairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to impairment of one of our held-for-sale assets in our real estate segment, which sold for less than the initial carrying value subsequent to quarter ended June 30, 2016. The initial carrying value was based on the initial purchase price allocation of the asset, which utilized different assumptions than the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation, primarily being a longer holding period. The sale price of the asset was in line with the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation. Impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to impairment of goodwill on one reporting unit which management deemed to be impaired in our real estate segment.\nManagement Fee, Related Party\nManagement fee, related party relates to the management fee incurred to our Manager in our corporate segment (refer to Related Parties Arrangements\u201d below for more information). The management contract with our Manager commenced on November 1, 2015.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses primarily represent third-party service provider fees such as audit and legal fees and other compliance related fees related to portfolio management of our real estate segment. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to the full year impact of owning and managing the New European Investments. We expect the benefit of the cost savings from the asset sales in 2017 due to timing of the unwind of the structures and the reduction in the number of entities.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses are principally incurred in our corporate segment. The year ended December 31, 2016 represents a full year of operating as a stand-alone company, which includes the impact of the implementation of an internal control environment and includes an allocation of general and administrative expenses from our Manager of $0.2 million. The year ended December 31, 2015 represent an allocation of certain costs and expenses related to activities for the launch of our European Real Estate Business prior to the Spin-off.\nCompensation Expense\nCompensation expense is comprised of time-based and performance equity-based based awards in our corporate segment. We began to incur compensation expense upon the Spin-off in November 2015. The year ended December 31, 2016 changes do not take into account the impact of the vesting as a result of the Mergers (refer to Item 8 Compensation Expense\u201d for more information).\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased due to 2016 being the first full year of activity, offset by the disposals of 18 properties during 2016 and assets being reclassified into held for sale in our real estate segment.\nOther Income (Loss)\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nUnrealized gain (loss) on investments and other is primarily related to the non-cash change in fair value of derivative instruments. The increase in the foreign currency forwards used to hedge projected net property level cash flows related to the strengthened U.S. dollar against the U.K. Pound Sterling and the Euro. The decrease on the interest rate caps relates to the movement in interest rate spreads within Europe.\nThe following table presents a summary of unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other for

In addition to investment-specific financings, we may use and have used credit facilities and repaid facilities on a shorter term basis and public and private, secured and unsecured debt issuances on a longer term basis. Our current primary liquidity needs are to fund:\n \u2022 our operating expenses and investment activities, including the repurchase of our common stock; \n \u2022 acquisitions of our target assets and related ongoing commitments; \n \u2022 distributions to our stockholders; \n \u2022 principal and interest payments on our borrowings; and \n \u2022 income tax liabilities of taxable REIT subsidiaries and we are subject to limitations as a REIT.  Our current primary sources of liquidity are:\n \u2022 net proceeds from asset sales; \n \u2022 financings secured by our assets such as mortgage notes, long-term senior and subordinate corporate capital such as revolving credit facilities, senior term loans, senior notes, senior exchangeable notes and perpetual preferred stock and common stock; \n \u2022 cash on hand; \n \u2022 cash flow generated from our investments, both from operations and return of capital; and \n \u2022 investment-level financing.  We seek to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, including the repayment of borrowings and our investment funding needs, through existing cash resources, issuance of debt or equity capital, return of capital from investments and the liquidation or refinancing of assets. Nonetheless, our ability to meet a long-term (beyond one year) liquidity requirement may be subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing. Any decision by our lenders and investors to provide us with financing will depend upon a number of factors, such as our compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements, our financial performance, industry or market trends, the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions, such lenders' and investors' resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities.\nAs a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders, including taxable income where we do not receive corresponding cash, and we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and to avoid federal income tax and the non-deductible excise tax. On a quarterly basis, our board of directors determines an appropriate common stock dividend based upon numerous factors, including CAD, REIT qualification requirements, availability of existing cash balances, borrowing capacity under existing credit agreements, access to cash in the capital markets and other financing sources, our view of our ability to realize gains in the future through appreciation in the value of our assets, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impact our business or prospects. Future dividend levels are subject to adjustment based upon our evaluation of the factors described above, as well as other factors that our board of directors may, from time-to-time, deem relevant to consider when determining an appropriate common stock dividend.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, NorthStar Realty provided us with an initial capitalization of $250 million. In addition, in November 2015, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock. That authorization expired in November 2016 and at such time our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $100 million of its outstanding common stock. The authorization expires in November 2017, unless otherwise extended by our board of directors. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 6 million shares of our common stock for $59 million. From November 2015 through December 31, 2016, we repurchased 9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $100 million.\nWe currently believe that our existing sources of funds should be adequate for purposes of meeting our short-term liquidity needs. We expect our contractual rental income is sufficient to meet our expected capital expenditures, interest expense, property operating and general and administrative expenses and common dividends declared by us. We may seek to raise additional capital in order to finance new acquisitions. Unrestricted cash as of March 13, 2017 was approximately $55.7 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands).\n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2016 represents our results of operations following the Spin-off and the first full year of activity as a stand-alone company. \n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2015 represents: (i) our results of operations following the Spin-off and two months of activity as a stand-alone company; and (ii) our results of operations of the European Real Estate Business as if the transferred business was the business for the periods in which common control was present and an allocation of costs related to us for the period from January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2015. \n \u2022 The period from January 1, 2014 to September 15, 2014 represents: (i) the Prior Owner Period results of operations, which represents the ownership period of a third party (refer to Critical Accounting Policy\u201d below for more information); and (ii) an allocation of costs related to the launch of the European Real Estate Business.

The annualized fee payable to our Manager is approximately $14 million as of December 31, 2016.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRelated Party Arrangements\nColony NorthStar, Inc.\nThe management agreement with our Manager is for an initial term of 20 years and provides for a base management fee and incentive fee. The management contract with our Manager commenced on November 1, 2015, and as such, there were no management fees incurred for the period from January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2014.\nBase Management Fee\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $14.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, related to the base management fee. The base management fee to our Manager could increase subsequent to December 31, 2016 by an amount equal to 1.5% per annum of the sum of:\n \u2022 any equity we issue in exchange or conversion of exchangeable or stock-settlable notes; \n \u2022 any other issuances by us of common equity, preferred equity or other forms of equity, including but not limited to limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership, which are structured as profits interests, or LTIP units (excluding units issued to us and equity-based compensation, but including issuances related to an acquisition, investment, joint venture or partnership); and \n \u2022 cumulative CAD, if any, in excess of cumulative distributions paid on common stock, LTIP Units or other equity awards which began with our fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016.  Incentive Fee\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not incur an incentive fee. The incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in cash, equal to:\n \u2022 the product of: (a) 15% and (b) our CAD before such incentive fee, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter, of any amount in excess of $0.30 per share and up to $0.36 per share; plus \n \u2022 the product of: (a) 25% and (b) our CAD before such incentive fee, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter, of any amount in excess of $0.36 per share; \n \u2022 multiplied by our weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter.  Weighted average shares represents the number of shares of our common stock, LTIP Units or other equity-based awards (with some exclusions), outstanding on a daily weighted average basis. With respect to the base management fee, all equity issuances are allocated on a daily weighted average basis during the fiscal quarter of issuance. With respect to the incentive fee, such amounts will be appropriately adjusted from time to time to take into account the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction.\nAdditional Management Agreement Terms\nIf we were to spin-off any asset or business in the future, such entity would be managed by our Manager on terms substantially similar to those set forth in the management agreement between us and our Manager. The management agreement further provides\nthat the aggregate base management fee in place immediately after any future spin-off will not be less than our aggregate base management fee in place immediately prior to such spin-off.\nOur management agreement with our Manager provides that in the event of a change of control of our Manager or other event that could be deemed an assignment of the management agreement, we will consider such assignment in good faith and not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay our consent. The management agreement further provides that we anticipate consent would be granted for an assignment or deemed assignment to a party with expertise in commercial real estate and over $10 billion of assets under management. The management agreement also provides that, notwithstanding anything in the agreement to the contrary, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, rules and regulations, in connection with any merger, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, change of control, reorganization, consolidation or any similar transaction of us or our Manager, directly or indirectly, the surviving entity will succeed to the terms of the management agreement.\nPayment of Costs and Expenses and Expense Allocation\nWe are responsible for all of our direct costs and expenses and reimburse our Manager for costs and expenses incurred by our Manager on our behalf. In addition, our Manager may allocate indirect costs to us related to employees, occupancy and other general and administrative costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limitations contained in, our management agreement with our Manager, or the G&A Allocation. Our management agreement with our Manager provides that the amount of the G&A Allocation will not exceed the following: (i) 20% of the combined total of: (a) our and NorthStar Realty's, or the NorthStar Listed Companies', general and administrative expenses as reported in their consolidated financial statements excluding (1) equity-based compensation expense, (2) non-recurring items, (3) fees payable to our Manager under the terms of the applicable management agreement and (4) any allocation of expenses to the NorthStar Listed Companies, or NorthStar Listed Companies' G&A; and (b) our Manager's general and administrative expenses as reported in its consolidated financial statements, excluding equity-based compensation expense and adding back any costs or expenses allocated to any managed company of our Manager; less (ii) the NorthStar Listed Companies' G&A. The G&A Allocation may include our allocable share of our Manager's compensation and benefit costs associated with dedicated or partially dedicated personnel who spend all or a portion of their time managing our affairs, based upon the percentage of time devoted by such personnel to our affairs. The G&A Allocation may also include rental and occupancy, technology, office supplies, travel and entertainment and other general and administrative costs and expenses, which may be allocated based on various methodologies, such as weighted average employee count or the percentage of time devoted by personnel to such NorthStar Listed Companies' affairs. In addition, we will pay directly or reimburse our Manager for an allocable portion of any severance paid pursuant to any employment, consulting or similar service agreements in effect between our Manager and any of its executives, employees or other service providers.\nIn connection with the Spin-off and the related agreements, the NorthStar Listed Companies' obligation to reimburse our Manager for the G&A Allocation and any severance are shared among the NorthStar Listed Companies, at our Manager's discretion, and the 20% cap on the G&A Allocation, as described above, applies on an aggregate basis to the NorthStar Listed Companies. Our Manager currently determined to allocate these amounts based on assets under management.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Manager allocated $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, to us. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Manager did not allocate any severance to us.\nAs a result of the Mergers, the management agreement between our Manager and NorthStar Realty terminated, such that we remain as the sole NorthStar Listed Company.\nIn addition, the management agreement provides that, we, together with NorthStar Realty and any company spun-off from us or NorthStar Realty, shall pay directly or reimburse our Manager for up to 50% of any long-term bonus or other compensation that our Manager's compensation committee determines shall be paid and/or settled in the form of equity and/or equity-based compensation to executives, employees and service providers of our Manager during any year. Subject to this limitation and limitations contained in any applicable management agreement between our Manager and NorthStar Realty or any company spun-off from us or NorthStar Realty, the amount paid by us, NorthStar Realty and any company spun-off from us or NorthStar Realty will be determined by our Manager in its discretion. At the discretion of our Manager's compensation committee, this compensation may be granted in shares of our restricted stock, restricted stock units, LTIP Units or other forms of equity compensation or stock-based awards; provided that if at any time a sufficient number of shares of our common stock are not available for issuance under our equity compensation plan, such compensation shall be paid in the form of RSUs, LTIP Units or other securities that may be settled in cash. Our equity compensation for each year may be allocated on an individual-by-individual basis at the discretion of our Manager compensation committee and, as long as the aggregate amount of the equity compensation for such year does not exceed the limits set forth in the management agreement, the proportion of any particular individual's equity compensation may be greater or less than 50%.\nOur Manager Purchase of Common Stock\nIn June 2016, our Manager purchased 0.2 million shares of our common stock through open market purchases for an aggregate purchase price of $2.3 million.\nRecent Developments\nDividends\nOn March 8, 2017, we declared a dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock. The common stock dividend will be paid on March 24, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 20, 2017.\nSales\nSubsequent to December 31, 2016, we sold one non-core asset in the Internos Portfolio with a carrying value of $17.2 million for $23.6 million.\nMergers\nOn January 10, 2017, our external manager, NSAM completed the tri-party merger with NorthStar Realty and Colony under which the companies combined in an all-stock merger of equals transaction to create a diversified real estate and investment management company. Under the terms of the merger agreement, NSAM, Colony and NorthStar Realty, through a series of transactions, merged with and into NSAM, which was renamed Colony NorthStar. Colony NorthStar is a leading global equity REIT with an embedded investment management platform. As a result of the Mergers, substantially all restricted shares and RSUs vested and only RSUs subject to performance-based hurdles remain outstanding.\nInflation\nVirtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other factors influence our performance significantly more than inflation does. A change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates may correlate with inflation rates. With the exception of the United Kingdom, generally rent is adjusted annually based on local consumer price indices. In the United Kingdom, rent is typically subject to an upward only rent review usually every three to five years.\nRefer to", "item_7_text": "Item 7.

Our objective is to provide our stockholders with stable and recurring cash flow supplemented by capital growth over time. We commenced operations on November 1, 2015 following the spin-off by NorthStar Realty of its European real estate business (excluding its European healthcare properties) into a separate publicly-traded company, NorthStar Europe, a Maryland corporation, or the Spin-off.\nUpon completion of the Spin-off, NorthStar Realty contributed: (i) its business activities related to the U.K. Complex, acquired on September 16, 2014; (ii) the New European Investments; and (iii) certain other assets and liabilities related to NorthStar Realty's European real estate business, herein collectively referred to as the European Real Estate Business.\nOn November 2, 2015, our common stock began trading on the NYSE under the symbol NRE.\u201d We are externally managed and advised by an affiliate of our Manager. Substantially all of our assets, directly or indirectly, are held by, and we conduct our operations, directly or indirectly, through our Operating Partnership. We have elected to be taxed and will continue to conduct our operations so as to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nSignificant Developments\nSales Initiatives\nIn 2016, we announced a strategy to focus on prime office properties located in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France. As a result, we undertook a sales initiative, selling 22 properties as of March 1, 2017 and realizing $380 million of net proceeds. Consequently, we no longer operate in Belgium, Italy or Sweden. In 2017, we expect to continue executing on our sales initiatives primarily with the goal of maximizing long-term stockholder value.\nSenior Notes\nIn 2016, we repurchased approximately $272.3 million of the Senior Notes and settled the remaining Senior Notes in cash at maturity.\nMergers Agreement among NSAM, NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc.\nOn January 10, 2017, our external manager, NSAM completed a tri-party merger with NorthStar Realty and Colony under which the companies combined in an all-stock merger of equals transaction to create a diversified real estate and investment management company. Under the terms of the merger agreement, NSAM, Colony and NorthStar Realty, through a series of transactions, merged with and into NSAM, which was renamed Colony NorthStar. Colony NorthStar is a leading global equity REIT with an embedded investment management platform.\nSummary of Business\nOur primary business line is European real estate. We are predominantly focused on prime office properties located in key cities within Germany, the United Kingdom and France. The following table presents a summary of assets acquired and sold for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and the period from January 1, 2017 to March 1, 2017:\n\n__________________\n (1) We committed to acquire the majority of our properties in 2014. \nSources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flows\nWe primarily generate revenue from rental and other operating income generated by our properties. Our income is primarily derived through the difference between the revenue and the operating and financing costs of our investments. We may also continue to acquire investments that generate attractive returns without any leverage.\nProfitability and Performance Metrics\nWe calculate cash available for distribution, or CAD, and net operating income, or NOI as metrics to evaluate the profitability and performance of our business (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a description of these metrics).\nOutlook and Recent Trends\nThe European economy concluded another positive year of growth in 2016. Fourth quarter Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, in the European Union, or the EU, and the Euro Area grew by 1.9% and 1.7% year on year, respectively. This represented the fourteenth consecutive quarter of growth in the Eurozone which outpaced the U.S. economy in 2016. In December of 2016, the European Central Bank, or ECB, extended its quantitative easing program until the end of 2017 while reducing the average volume of asset purchases from \u20ac80 billion to \u20ac60 billion per month from April 2017. The monetary stimulus provided by the ECB appears to be having the desired effect of encouraging companies and households to borrow and increase expenditure.\nIn February 2017, the European Commission, or EC, revised its 2017 GDP forecast for the Euro Area up by 0.1% to 1.6% with growth expected to continue to be driven primarily by domestic demand. The 2018 Euro Area outlook has also been revised upwards to 1.8%, 0.1% above the November 2016 forecast. Inflation in the EU has begun to rise since the end of 2016 and is expected to rise from 0.3% in 2016 to 1.8% in 2017.\nUnemployment in the EU continued to fall, reaching 8.1% in January 2017 (down from 8.9% a year earlier), the lowest level recorded since January 2009. The EC predicts a continued improvement in the labor market in 2017 and 2018.\nThe German economy strengthened further in 2016, with GDP growth of 1.9% (an increase of 0.2% compared to 2015), driven by a combination of private consumption and resilient exports fueled by a weaker Euro. The EC forecasts that Germany will maintain this momentum through 2017 and 2018, resulting in projected GDP growth of 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively. The French economy grew by 1.2% in 2016 (0.1% lower compared to 2015) and is expected to reach 1.4% and 1.7% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The U.K. economy has performed better than generally expected since the EU referendum in June 2016, achieving 0.6% GDP growth in the fourth quarter and 2.0% growth year on year in 2016. This has likely been fueled by a combination of depreciation in the value of U.K. Pound Sterling, an increase in the Bank of England's, or BOE's, quantitative easing program by \u00a370 billion and the reduction in the interest rate to 0.25%. In light of this stronger than anticipated performance, the EC recently improved its U.K. growth outlook for 2017 by 0.5% to 1.5%. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the future of the U.K.'s relationship with the EU as well as its non-EU trading partners as the process of exiting the EU evolves.\nBeyond the U.K., upcoming elections in countries including the Netherlands, France and Germany have the potential to exacerbate the level of geopolitical uncertainty that currently exists within Europe and globally. While we continue to remain positive regarding the prospects for the region, the outcome of these events as well as the financial health of certain peripheral countries such as Greece, Italy and Portugal - including the health of their respective banking sectors and high levels of public debt - pose a potential risk to the stability of the region and its future economic growth prospects.\nDespite a strong fourth quarter (\u20ac87 billion investment volume, a 5% year-on-year increase), total European commercial real estate investment volume remained 10% below its 2015 level, reaching \u20ac251 billion in 2016. However, this was driven by a sharp decline in U.K. investment volume. Overall investment volume across Europe, excluding the U.K., actually grew by 5% year on year, continuing to reflect strong demand from investors. The office sector, which accounted for approximately 43% of overall 2016 investment volume, proved relatively resilient in 2016, showing only a 5% annual decline in volume (including the U.K.).\nQuarter on quarter investment activity rose by 26% in the U.K. during the fourth quarter. This was widely attributed to overseas investors seeking to take advantage of U.K. Pounds Sterling's devaluation since the EU referendum. However, full year 2016 U.K. investment volume remained significantly below its 2015 level falling by 28% in local currency. Germany surpassed the U.K. as the most active investment market in the second half of the year. Full year 2016 investment volume reached \u20ac53 billion, only 4% below 2015. During the year, average prime office yields across the top 7 German cities fell by approximately 59 bps to 3.6% reflecting the strongest annual yield compression witnessed during the past 10 years.\nFull year 2016 investment volume in France reached \u20ac26 million, 4% below its 2015 level. At the end of 2016, prime office yields in Greater Paris, which represented 75% of total French investment volume, reached an all-time low of 3.0%.\nOccupational demand across the major European office markets remains robust with strong take-up and decreasing vacancy rates witnessed across most major cities. This trend is expected to continue through 2017 driven by improving macroeconomic fundamentals and a limited new supply pipeline.\nOur Strategy\nWe seek to provide our stockholders with a stable and recurring cash flow for distribution supplemented by capital growth over time. Our business is predominantly focused on prime office properties located in key cities within our Core Markets. These are not only the largest economies in Europe, but the largest, most established, liquid and among the most stable office markets in Europe. We seek to utilize our established local networks to source suitable investment opportunities. We have a long term investment approach and expect to make equity investments, directly or indirectly through joint ventures.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBasis of Accounting\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and our related notes for the period prior to the Spin-off are presented on a carve-out basis and have been prepared from the historical consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows of NorthStar Realty in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe contribution of the European Real Estate Business to us has been determined to be a combination of entities under common control which results in a change in the reporting entity and requires retrospective application to our financial statements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the operations of the European Real Estate Business of NorthStar Realty transferred to us upon the Spin-off are presented as if the transferred business was our business for periods in which common control was present and at the carrying value of such assets and liabilities recorded in NorthStar Realty's historical books and records. As a result, the combined consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 was updated to include items related to the New European Investments, such as cash of $0.5 million, certain deposits of $58.6 million, related foreign exchange loss of $1.1 million and transaction costs incurred of $27.5 million. The cash, deposits paid and transaction costs incurred are recorded as net transactions with NorthStar Realty through equity.\nPrior to the Spin-off, our financial statements had not been prepared as we were not operated separately from NorthStar Realty. The consolidated financial statements for such prior periods reflect our revenues and direct expenses and include material assets and liabilities of NorthStar Realty that are specifically identifiable to the European Real Estate Business and contributed to us upon completion of the Spin-off. The consolidated financial statements for the period ended January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2015 and the combined consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 represent us prior to the Spin-off and include certain consolidated subsidiaries. Subsequent to the Spin-off, the financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis.\nIn addition, the combined consolidated financial statements include activity related to the ownership period prior to the Acquisition Date of the U.K. Complex, herein referred to as the Prior Owner Period. The year ended December 31, 2014 include activities of the U.K. Complex from January 1, 2014 to the Acquisition Date. Because the U.K. Complex was acquired from an unrelated third party on the Acquisition Date, a blackline\u201d presentation for the change in basis giving effect to purchase accounting pursuant to U.S. GAAP is presented.\nThe combined consolidated financial statements for the period from the Acquisition Date, or NorthStar Europe Period, and Prior Owner Period include an allocation of costs and expenses by NorthStar Realty related to us (primarily compensation and other general and administrative expense of $1 million) based on an estimate of expenses as if we were managed as an independent entity. This allocation method is principally based on relative headcount and management's knowledge of our operations. The amounts allocated in the accompanying combined consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the actual amount of such indirect expenses that would have been recorded had we been a separate independent entity. We believe the assumptions underlying its allocation of indirect expenses are reasonable. In addition, an estimate of management fees to our Manager was recorded for the NorthStar Europe Period as if we were managed as an independent entity. We began paying management fees to our Manager on November 1, 2015 pursuant to the terms of our management agreement with our Manager.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the combined accounts of NorthStar Realty Europe Corp., our Operating Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries. We consolidate variable interest entities, or VIEs, where we are the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities which are generally majority owned or otherwise controlled by us. All significant intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis. We base the qualitative analysis on our review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity. We reassess the initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events.\nA VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE. We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE's purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to our business activities and the other interests. We reassess the determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period. Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions.\nWe will evaluate our investments in unconsolidated ventures to determine whether they are a VIE. We analyze new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing.\nVoting Interest Entities\nA voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If we have a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated. We do not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority vote.\nWe perform on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework.\nNon-controlling Interests\nA non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined as the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to us. A non-controlling interest is required to be presented as a separate component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets and presented separately as net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss), or OCI, attributable to non-controlling interests. An allocation to a non-controlling interest may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents.\nOperating Real Estate\nOperating real estate is carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Major replacements and improvements which extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their useful life. Operating real estate is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nWe account for purchases of operating real estate that qualify as business combinations using the acquisition method, where the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets such as land, building, tenant and land improvements and other identified intangibles, such as in-place leases, above/below-market leases and goodwill. Costs directly related to an acquisition deemed to be a business combination are expensed and included in transaction costs in our consolidated statements of operations.\nAssets and Liabilities Held For Sale\nOperating real estate which has met the criteria to be classified as held for sale is separately presented on the consolidated balance sheets. Such operating real estate is recorded at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value less the cost to sell net of the intangible assets associated with the asset. Once a property is determined to be held for sale, depreciation is no longer recorded. We record a gain or loss on sale of real estate when title is conveyed to the buyer and we have no substantial economic involvement with the property. If the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, we defer some or all of the gain or loss recognition by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery method, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.\nIntangible Assets and Intangible Liabilities\nWe record acquired identified intangibles, which includes intangible assets (such as value of the above-market leases, in-place leases, below-market ground leases, goodwill and other intangibles) and intangible liabilities (such as the value of below-market leases), based on estimated fair value. The value allocated to the above or below-market leases is amortized net adjustment to rental income, the value of below-market ground leases is amortized into properties - operating expense and in-place leases is amortized into depreciation and amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the respective remaining lease term.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized. We analyze goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable. We first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit, related to such goodwill, is less than the carrying amount as a basis to determine whether the two-step impairment test is necessary. The first step in the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, the second step is required to determine the amount of the impairment loss, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of such goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is derived by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit as of the measurement date, allocating the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its net assets and identifiable intangible assets. The residual amount represents the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEvents or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include (but are not limited to) issues with laws and regulations; on-going or projected negative operating income or cash flow; and/or a significant change in the occupancy rate and/or rising interest rates.\nA market approach is performed based on an income approach whereby we look at comparable properties, current market conditions, forecasts and representative transactions to validate management's expectations, where possible. The main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment, include the selection of guideline transactions, the derivation and selection of multiples and the financial metrics of the properties. The starting point for each of the reporting unit's multiples is the detailed annual plan and rent roll. The detailed planning process takes into consideration many factors including revenue growth rate and capital spending requirements, among other items which impact the individual reporting unit projections. Fair value of the reporting unit is derived using significant unobservable inputs or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. These inputs are based on internal management estimates, forecasts and judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nOperating Real Estate\nRental and escalation income from operating real estate is derived from leasing of space to various types of tenants. Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. The leases are for fixed terms of varying length and generally provide for annual rentals, subject to indexation and expense reimbursements to be paid in quarterly or monthly installments. Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in unbilled rent receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. We amortize any tenant inducements as a reduction of revenue utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the lease. Escalation income represents revenue from\ntenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes paid by us on behalf of the respective property. This revenue is accrued in the same period as the expenses are incurred.\nIn a situation in which a lease or leases associated with a significant tenant have been, or are expected to be, terminated early, we evaluate the remaining useful life of depreciable or amortizable assets in the asset group related to the lease that will be terminated (i.e., tenant improvements, above and below market lease intangibles, in-place lease value and leasing commissions). Based upon consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the termination, we may write-off or accelerate the depreciation and amortization associated with the asset group. Such amounts are included within depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations.\nImpairment on Investments\nOperating Real Estate\nOur real estate portfolio is reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our operating real estate may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable. A property's value is considered impaired if our estimate of the aggregate expected future undiscounted cash flow to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. In conducting this review, we consider global macroeconomic factors, real estate sector conditions, together with investment specific and other factors. To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the property over the estimated fair value of the property and recorded in impairment losses in our consolidated statements of operations.\nAn allowance for a doubtful account for a tenant receivable is established based on a periodic review of aged receivables resulting from estimated losses due to the inability of a tenant to make required rent and other payments contractually due. Additionally, we establish, on a current basis, an allowance for future tenant credit losses on unbilled rent receivable based on an evaluation of the collectability of such amounts.\nDerivatives\nWe seek to use derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. The change in fair value for a derivative is recorded in earnings.\nOur derivative instruments do not qualify as hedges under U.S. GAAP.\nForeign Currency\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is a foreign currency are translated using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are translated into U.S. dollars using the average currency exchange rate in effect during the period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated OCI.\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are remeasured using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the average currency exchange rate in effect during the period. The resulting foreign currency remeasurement adjustment is recorded in unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting update requiring a company to recognize as revenue the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The accounting standard update will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance currently promulgated by U.S. GAAP. In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. The effective date of the new revenue standard for us will be January 1, 2018. Leases are specifically excluded from this guidance and will be governed by the applicable lease codification; however, this update may have implications in certain variable payment terms included in lease agreements and in sale and leaseback transactions. We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the update on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that changes the rules regarding consolidation. The pronouncement eliminates specialized guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities and removes the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds. The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter 2016 and determined our Operating Partnership is considered a VIE. We are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE's assets can be used for purposes other than the settlement of the VIE's obligations and our partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest. In addition, we identified each of our properties that have non-controlling interests as VIEs. These entities are VIEs because the non-controlling interests do not have substantive kick-out\nor participating rights and we are the primary beneficiary. As such, this standard resulted in the identification of additional VIEs, however it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e., lessees and lessors). The update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The update is expected to result in the recognition of a right-to-use asset and related liability to account for the Company's future obligations under its ground lease arrangements for which it is the lessee. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining contractual payments under the Company's ground lease agreements are discussed in Note 11. Additionally, the new update will require that lessees and lessors capitalize, as initial direct costs, only those costs that are incurred due to the execution of a lease. Under this guidance, allocated payroll costs and other costs that are incurred regardless of whether the lease is obtained will no longer be capitalized as initial direct costs and instead will be expensed as incurred. Lessors will continue to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The new guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance clarifying that an assessment of whether an embedded contingent put or call option is clearly and closely related to a borrowing requires only an analysis of the four-step decision sequence. Additionally, entities are not required to separately assess whether the contingency itself is clearly and closely related. Entities are required to apply the guidance to existing instruments in scope using a modified retrospective transition method as of the period of adoption. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years. We have concluded that this guidance will not have any impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends several aspects of the accounting for equity-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statements of cash flows. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. We will adopt the new guidance prospectively on January 1, 2017 and do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes the impairment model for most financial instruments by requiring companies to recognize an allowance for expected losses, rather than incurred losses as required currently by the other-than-temporary impairment model. The guidance will apply to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures (e.g., loan commitments). The new guidance is effective for reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2019 and will be applied as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued guidance that makes eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The new guidance requires adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case we would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. Entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated statement of cash flows.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to clarify the definition of a business under ASC 805. This new standard clarifies the definition of a business and provides a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and\ninterim periods within those years, beginning December 15, 2017. The amendments in this update will be applied on a prospective basis. We expect that acquisitions of real estate or in-substance real estate will not meet the revised definition of a business because substantially all of the fair value is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets (i.e. land, buildings, and related intangible assets).\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance which removes Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The guidance is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.\nResults of Operations\nThe following presents a summary of our activity for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2016 represents our results of operations following the Spin-off and the first full year of activity as a stand-alone company. During the year, we disposed of 18 assets. \n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2015 represents: (i) our results of operations following the Spin-off and two months of activity as a stand-alone company; and (ii) our results of operations of the European Real Estate Business as if the transferred business was the business for the periods in which common control was present and an allocation of costs related to us for the period from January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2015.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):\n\nSame Store Analysis\nThe following table presents our same store analysis for the real estate segment which excludes properties that were acquired or sold at any time during the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 which includes a reconciliation from the same store analysis for the real estate segment to income (loss) before income tax (benefit) provision (dollar in thousands):\n\n__________________\n (1) Includes depreciation and amortization expense, transaction costs, general and administrative expense, management fees and other expenses. \n (2) Represents impact of assets sales net of foreign currency exchange. \nSame store revenue for the fourth quarter remained stable as a result of new leases signed in 2016, an increase in same store escalation income ($1.7 million, the majority of which was offset by the increase in properties operating expense) and other market rent and indexation adjustments, offset by a significant tenant vacancy in the Trianon Tower as a result of a tenant expiry at the end of the third quarter of 2016. Interest expense was approximately 14% lower in 2016 as a result of the refinancing of certain mortgage notes. Unrealized gains (loss) on investments and other increased due to the movements in foreign exchange rates on the interest rate caps. Realized gains (loss) on investments and other increased due to the write-off of the deferred financing costs related to the refinancing in 2015.\nRefer to Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d Note 12 Quarterly Financial Information\u201d for more information related to the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nRevenues\nRental Income\nRental income consists of rental revenue in our real estate segment.

The initial carrying value was based on the initial purchase price allocation of the asset, which utilized different assumptions than the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation, primarily being a longer holding period. The sale price of the asset was in line with the December 31, 2015 year end independent valuation. Impairment losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 relates to impairment of goodwill on one reporting unit which management deemed to be impaired in our real estate segment.\nManagement Fee, Related Party\nManagement fee, related party relates to the management fee incurred to our Manager in our corporate segment (refer to Related Parties Arrangements\u201d below for more information).

In addition to investment-specific financings, we may use and have used credit facilities and repaid facilities on a shorter term basis and public and private, secured and unsecured debt issuances on a longer term basis. Our current primary liquidity needs are to fund:\n \u2022 our operating expenses and investment activities, including the repurchase of our common stock; \n \u2022 acquisitions of our target assets and related ongoing commitments; \n \u2022 distributions to our stockholders; \n \u2022 principal and interest payments on our borrowings; and \n \u2022 income tax liabilities of taxable REIT subsidiaries and we are subject to limitations as a REIT.  Our current primary sources of liquidity are:\n \u2022 net proceeds from asset sales; \n \u2022 financings secured by our assets such as mortgage notes, long-term senior and subordinate corporate capital such as revolving credit facilities, senior term loans, senior notes, senior exchangeable notes and perpetual preferred stock and common stock; \n \u2022 cash on hand; \n \u2022 cash flow generated from our investments, both from operations and return of capital; and \n \u2022 investment-level financing.  We seek to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, including the repayment of borrowings and our investment funding needs, through existing cash resources, issuance of debt or equity capital, return of capital from investments and the liquidation or refinancing of assets. Nonetheless, our ability to meet a long-term (beyond one year) liquidity requirement may be subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing. Any decision by our lenders and investors to provide us with financing will depend upon a number of factors, such as our compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements, our financial performance, industry or market trends, the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions, such lenders' and investors' resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities.\nAs a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders, including taxable income where we do not receive corresponding cash, and we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and to avoid federal income tax and the non-deductible excise tax. On a quarterly basis, our board of directors determines an appropriate common stock dividend based upon numerous factors, including CAD, REIT qualification requirements, availability of existing cash balances, borrowing capacity under existing credit agreements, access to cash in the capital markets and other financing sources, our view of our ability to realize gains in the future through appreciation in the value of our assets, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impact our business or prospects. Future dividend levels are subject to adjustment based upon our evaluation of the factors described above, as well as other factors that our board of directors may, from time-to-time, deem relevant to consider when determining an appropriate common stock dividend.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, NorthStar Realty provided us with an initial capitalization of $250 million. In addition, in November 2015, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock. That authorization expired in November 2016 and at such time our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $100 million of its outstanding common stock. The authorization expires in November 2017, unless otherwise extended by our board of directors. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 6 million shares of our common stock for $59 million. From November 2015 through December 31, 2016, we repurchased 9 million shares of our common stock for approximately $100 million.\nWe currently believe that our existing sources of funds should be adequate for purposes of meeting our short-term liquidity needs. We expect our contractual rental income is sufficient to meet our expected capital expenditures, interest expense, property operating and general and administrative expenses and common dividends declared by us. We may seek to raise additional capital in order to finance new acquisitions. Unrestricted cash as of March 13, 2017 was approximately $55.7 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands).\n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2016 represents our results of operations following the Spin-off and the first full year of activity as a stand-alone company. \n \u2022 Year ended December 31, 2015 represents: (i) our results of operations following the Spin-off and two months of activity as a stand-alone company; and (ii) our results of operations of the European Real Estate Business as if the transferred business was the business for the periods in which common control was present and an allocation of costs related to us for the period from January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2015. \n \u2022 The period from January 1, 2014 to September 15, 2014 represents: (i) the Prior Owner Period results of operations, which represents the ownership period of a third party (refer to Critical Accounting Policy\u201d below for more information); and (ii) an allocation of costs related to the launch of the European Real Estate Business.

The base management fee to our Manager could increase subsequent to December 31, 2016 by an amount equal to 1.5% per annum of the sum of:\n \u2022 any equity we issue in exchange or conversion of exchangeable or stock-settlable notes; \n \u2022 any other issuances by us of common equity, preferred equity or other forms of equity, including but not limited to limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership, which are structured as profits interests, or LTIP units (excluding units issued to us and equity-based compensation, but including issuances related to an acquisition, investment, joint venture or partnership); and \n \u2022 cumulative CAD, if any, in excess of cumulative distributions paid on common stock, LTIP Units or other equity awards which began with our fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016.  Incentive Fee\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we did not incur an incentive fee. The incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in cash, equal to:\n \u2022 the product of: (a) 15% and (b) our CAD before such incentive fee, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter, of any amount in excess of $0.30 per share and up to $0.36 per share; plus \n \u2022 the product of: (a) 25% and (b) our CAD before such incentive fee, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter, of any amount in excess of $0.36 per share; \n \u2022 multiplied by our weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter.  Weighted average shares represents the number of shares of our common stock, LTIP Units or other equity-based awards (with some exclusions), outstanding on a daily weighted average basis. With respect to the base management fee, all equity issuances are allocated on a daily weighted average basis during the fiscal quarter of issuance. With respect to the incentive fee, such amounts will be appropriately adjusted from time to time to take into account the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction.\nAdditional Management Agreement Terms\nIf we were to spin-off any asset or business in the future, such entity would be managed by our Manager on terms substantially similar to those set forth in the management agreement between us and our Manager. The management agreement further provides\nthat the aggregate base management fee in place immediately after any future spin-off will not be less than our aggregate base management fee in place immediately prior to such spin-off.\nOur management agreement with our Manager provides that in the event of a change of control of our Manager or other event that could be deemed an assignment of the management agreement, we will consider such assignment in good faith and not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay our consent. The management agreement further provides that we anticipate consent would be granted for an assignment or deemed assignment to a party with expertise in commercial real estate and over $10 billion of assets under management. The management agreement also provides that, notwithstanding anything in the agreement to the contrary, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, rules and regulations, in connection with any merger, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, change of control, reorganization, consolidation or any similar transaction of us or our Manager, directly or indirectly, the surviving entity will succeed to the terms of the management agreement.\nPayment of Costs and Expenses and Expense Allocation\nWe are responsible for all of our direct costs and expenses and reimburse our Manager for costs and expenses incurred by our Manager on our behalf. In addition, our Manager may allocate indirect costs to us related to employees, occupancy and other general and administrative costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limitations contained in, our management agreement with our Manager, or the G&A Allocation. Our management agreement with our Manager provides that the amount of the G&A Allocation will not exceed the following: (i) 20% of the combined total of: (a) our and NorthStar Realty's, or the NorthStar Listed Companies', general and administrative expenses as reported in their consolidated financial statements excluding (1) equity-based compensation expense, (2) non-recurring items, (3) fees payable to our Manager under the terms of the applicable management agreement and (4) any allocation of expenses to the NorthStar Listed Companies, or NorthStar Listed Companies' G&A; and (b) our Manager's general and administrative expenses as reported in its consolidated financial statements, excluding equity-based compensation expense and adding back any costs or expenses allocated to any managed company of our Manager; less (ii) the NorthStar Listed Companies' G&A. The G&A Allocation may include our allocable share of our Manager's compensation and benefit costs associated with dedicated or partially dedicated personnel who spend all or a portion of their time managing our affairs, based upon the percentage of time devoted by such personnel to our affairs. The G&A Allocation may also include rental and occupancy, technology, office supplies, travel and entertainment and other general and administrative costs and expenses, which may be allocated based on various methodologies, such as weighted average employee count or the percentage of time devoted by personnel to such NorthStar Listed Companies' affairs. In addition, we will pay directly or reimburse our Manager for an allocable portion of any severance paid pursuant to any employment, consulting or similar service agreements in effect between our Manager and any of its executives, employees or other service providers.\nIn connection with the Spin-off and the related agreements, the NorthStar Listed Companies' obligation to reimburse our Manager for the G&A Allocation and any severance are shared among the NorthStar Listed Companies, at our Manager's discretion, and the 20% cap on the G&A Allocation, as described above, applies on an aggregate basis to the NorthStar Listed Companies. Our Manager currently determined to allocate these amounts based on assets under management.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our Manager allocated $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively, to us. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Manager did not allocate any severance to us.\nAs a result of the Mergers, the management agreement between our Manager and NorthStar Realty terminated, such that we remain as the sole NorthStar Listed Company.\nIn addition, the management agreement provides that, we, together with NorthStar Realty and any company spun-off from us or NorthStar Realty, shall pay directly or reimburse our Manager for up to 50% of any long-term bonus or other compensation that our Manager's compensation committee determines shall be paid and/or settled in the form of equity and/or equity-based compensation to executives, employees and service providers of our Manager during any year. Subject to this limitation and limitations contained in any applicable management agreement between our Manager and NorthStar Realty or any company spun-off from us or NorthStar Realty, the amount paid by us, NorthStar Realty and any company spun-off from us or NorthStar Realty will be determined by our Manager in its discretion. At the discretion of our Manager's compensation committee, this compensation may be granted in shares of our restricted stock, restricted stock units, LTIP Units or other forms of equity compensation or stock-based awards; provided that if at any time a sufficient number of shares of our common stock are not available for issuance under our equity compensation plan, such compensation shall be paid in the form of RSUs, LTIP Units or other securities that may be settled in cash. Our equity compensation for each year may be allocated on an individual-by-individual basis at the discretion of our Manager compensation committee and, as long as the aggregate amount of the equity compensation for such year does not exceed the limits set forth in the management agreement, the proportion of any particular individual's equity compensation may be greater or less than 50%.\nOur Manager Purchase of Common Stock\nIn June 2016, our Manager purchased 0.2 million shares of our common stock through open market purchases for an aggregate purchase price of $2.3 million.\nRecent Developments\nDividends\nOn March 8, 2017, we declared a dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock. The common stock dividend will be paid on March 24, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 20, 2017.\nSales\nSubsequent to December 31, 2016, we sold one non-core asset in the Internos Portfolio with a carrying value of $17.2 million for $23.6 million.\nMergers\nOn January 10, 2017, our external manager, NSAM completed the tri-party merger with NorthStar Realty and Colony under which the companies combined in an all-stock merger of equals transaction to create a diversified real estate and investment management company. Under the terms of the merger agreement, NSAM, Colony and NorthStar Realty, through a series of transactions, merged with and into NSAM, which was renamed Colony NorthStar. Colony NorthStar is a leading global equity REIT with an embedded investment management platform. As a result of the Mergers, substantially all restricted shares and RSUs vested and only RSUs subject to performance-based hurdles remain outstanding.\nInflation\nVirtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other factors influence our performance significantly more than inflation does. A change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates may correlate with inflation rates. With the exception of the United Kingdom, generally rent is adjusted annually based on local consumer price indices. In the United Kingdom, rent is typically subject to an upward only rent review usually every three to five years.\nRefer to", "item_7_tables": "Table 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

(NorthStar Europe), a publicly-traded REIT focusing on European commercial real estate, particularly prime office properties in Germany, the UK, and France. The discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements and notes, risk factors, and references to the company's manager, NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. before the mergers and Colony NorthStar, Inc. after the mergers.\n\nSignificant developments in 2016 included a strategy to focus on office properties in key cities, resulting in the sale of 22 properties and $380 million in net proceeds. NorthStar Europe also repurchased $272.3 million of Senior Notes and settled the remaining notes in cash.\n\nA notable event was the merger completed on January 10, 2017, where NSAM merged with NorthStar Realty and Colony Capital, Inc. to form Colony NorthStar, a diversified real estate and investment management company.\n\nThe company predominantly earns revenue through rental and other operating income from its properties. NorthStar Europe aims to maintain stable and recurring cash flow supplemented by capital growth. Methods to assess profitability include cash available for distribution (CAD) and net operating income (NOI).\n\nThe European economy and the real estate market showed positive growth in 2016. However, there were uncertainties, such as the United Kingdom's EU exit and upcoming elections in other significant European countries. Investment volumes in European commercial real estate were 10% below 2015 levels due to a sharp decline in the UK, even though investment rose by 5% when excluding the UK. Germany's investment volume ended the year at \u20ac53 billion, just 4% below 2015.\n\nNorthStar Europe's strategy focuses on delivering stable and recurring cash flow to its stockholders with prime office properties in major European cities. It looks to use its established networks to source investment opportunities and make equity investments through joint ventures.\n\nIn terms of accounting, the financial statements for periods prior to the spin-off from NorthStar Realty are presented on a carve-out basis. Principles of consolidation include combining accounts of NorthStar Realty Europe Corp., its Operating Partnership, and their subsidiaries. Finally, recent accounting pronouncements that may impact the consolidated financial position, results of operations, and disclosures are discussed.\n\nOperating revenues and profitability metrics show increases in rental and escalation income and other revenue in 2016, with an overall net income loss improvement from $(144,143) in 2015 to $(62,502) in 2016.\n\nNorthStar Europe's liquidity needs include operating expenses, acquisitions, stockholder distributions, debt repayments, and income tax liabilities. It aims to meet these through existing cash resources, issuance of debt and equity, investment cash flow, and financing.\n\nFinally, the report examines cash flows for 2016 compared to 2015 and highlights the dividends declared, asset sales, and effects of the mergers and inflation on the company's performance."}
