MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCore Laboratories N.V. is a Netherlands limited liability company. We were established in 1936 and are one of the world's leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description and production enhancement services and products to the oil and gas industry, primarily through client relationships with many of the world's major, national and independent oil companies.\nWe operate our business in two reporting segments. These complementary segments provide different services and products and utilize different technologies for evaluating and improving reservoir performance and increasing oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields:\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Reservoir Description: Encompasses the characterization of petroleum reservoir rock and reservoir fluids samples to increase production and improve recovery of crude oil and natural gas from our clients' reservoirs. We provide laboratory-based analytical and field services to characterize properties of crude oil and crude oil-derived products to the oil and gas industry. We also provide proprietary and joint industry studies based on these types of analyses and manufacture associated laboratory equipment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Production Enhancement: Includes services and manufactured products relating to reservoir well completions, perforations, stimulation and production. We provide integrated diagnostic services to evaluate and monitor the effectiveness of well completions and to develop solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery projects.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral Overview\nWe provide services as well as design and produce products which enable our clients to evaluate and improve reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields. These services and products are generally in higher demand when our clients are investing capital in their field development programs that are designed to increase productivity from existing fields or when exploring for appraising and developing new fields. Our clients' investment in capital expenditure programs tends to correlate over the longer term to oil and natural gas commodity prices. During periods of higher, stable prices, our clients generally invest more in capital expenditures and, during periods of lower or volatile commodity prices, they tend to invest less. Consequently, the level of capital expenditures by our clients impacts the demand for our services and products.\nThe following table summarizes the annual average and year-end worldwide and U.S. rig counts for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, as well as the annual average and year-end spot price of a barrel of WTI crude, Europe Brent crude and an MMBtu of natural gas:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Baker Hughes Worldwide Average Rig Count (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Baker Hughes U.S. Average Rig Count (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Baker Hughes Worldwide Year-End Rig Count (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Baker Hughes U.S. Year-End Rig Count (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Crude Oil Price per Barrel WTI (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Crude Oil Price per Barrel Brent (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 71.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Natural Gas Price per MMBtu (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year-end Crude Oil Price per Barrel WTI (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year-end Crude Oil Price per Barrel Brent (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year-end Natural Gas Price per MMBtu (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) Twelve month average rig count as reported by Baker Hughes - Worldwide Rig Count.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (2) Year-end rig count as reported by Baker Hughes - Worldwide Rig Count.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (3) Average daily and year-end West Texas Intermediate crude spot price as reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (\"EIA\").\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (4) Average daily and year-end Europe Brent crude spot price as reported by the EIA.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (5) Average daily and year-end Henry Hub natural gas spot price as reported by the EIA.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe prices for both WTI and Brent crude oil declined from 2018 to 2019 and decreased significantly at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and throughout the second quarter of 2020, due to the outbreak of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated government mandated shut-downs around the world, home sheltering and social distancing policies, have caused a significant decline in the demand for crude oil and associated products. Crude-oil prices improved during the second half of 2020, and became more stable during the fourth quarter of the year. The end result was the average price for crude oil in 2020 was approximately 33% lower than the average price for 2019. In general, activities associated with the exploration of oil and\ngas in the U.S. onshore market are more sensitive to changes in the crude-oil commodity prices, as opposed to larger international and offshore projects which take multiple years to plan and develop, and once announced and started, will continue through completion, despite changes in the current price of crude oil. Crude-oil prices in 2018 and 2019 remained at levels sufficient to support more stable levels in U.S. onshore activities associated with both the exploration and production of crude oil. Additionally, during the 2018 - 2019 time period, public announcements of investments in larger international and offshore projects increased and activity levels on these larger international and offshore projects began to improve in 2018 and continued to improve into 2019. However, in early 2020, the impact of COVID-19 to global economies caused a significant and sharp decline in demand for crude oil, which resulted in a significant and sharp decrease in the price of crude oil. Activity levels in the U.S. onshore market also responded immediately and decreased significantly to historically low levels, which bottomed in the summer of 2020, but showed some recovery in the second half of the year as global demand partially recovered, global production of crude oil was reduced and crude oil prices showed some recovery. Information published by the EIA, shows that the inventory of wells drilled but uncompleted (a DUC\u201d well) was 7,543 as of December 31, 2018, increasing to a peak in July 2019 at approximately 8,533, however, it subsequently declined to 7,782 and 7,592 at end of 2019 and 2020, respectively. This data indicates that during the period of higher activity in 2018, operators were drilling wells but not completing them as the DUC inventory grew. However, as activity levels began to fall in the second half of 2019, and a sharper decline in 2020, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, the operators began to drill fewer new wells, but were completing some of the wells that had been previously drilled, which is reflected in the lower DUC inventory at December 2019 and 2020.\nIn North America, the land-based rig count decreased over 11% from 2018 to 2019. There was subsequently a significant decline of 51% in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19. Consequently, the magnitude of decline in demand for both services and product sales to this market responded in line with the changes over this time period. The increase in activities on development projects and producing fields in the U.S. unconventional reservoirs during 2018 showed a decline when the commodity price weakened and activity levels decreased in 2019. In the U.S., the lower commodity prices led to a 54% decrease in the annual average land-based rig count and a decline in U.S. based activities in 2020.\nOutside of North America, activities associated with the exploration for and production of oil were showing modest improvement in 2018 and 2019 until the global pandemic emerged in early 2020. The decrease in global demand for crude oil caused by the global pandemic also had a significant impact on exploration and production activities in the international markets as the number of active rigs outside the United States decreased almost 39% during 2020. Long-term international and offshore projects which are commonly announced through Final Investment Decisions and subsequently initiated are not susceptible or at-risk to delay or suspension due to short-term volatility in crude-oil commodity price, however the extreme negative market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to reduce the spread of the virus have negatively impacted the entire energy market in 2020.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nWe evaluate our operating results by analyzing revenue, operating income and operating income margin (defined as operating income divided by total revenue). Since we have a relatively fixed cost structure, decreases in revenue generally translate into lower operating income results. Results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are summarized in the following chart:\nResults of operations as a percentage of applicable revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020,

is primarily tied to activities associated with the exploration and production of oil and gas outside the U.S., decreased to $376.4 million in 2020 from $474.2 million in 2019 and $486.8 million in 2018. In 2020, the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and government mandated shut-down around the world, home sheltering and social distancing policies caused a sharp decline in the demand for crude-oil and associated products. The average crude-oil price in 2020 was 33% lower than the average price of 2019. This resulted in decreased and disrupted activity by our clients and disruptions to our revenue generating operational activities leading to a sharp decrease in service revenue in both the U.S. and international markets during most of 2020. Crude-oil prices weakened in 2019 with the average price of 10% lower than the average price in 2018. This resulted in decreased activity by our clients leading to lower service revenue in the North America onshore market during 2019 compared to 2018. However, improvement in the level of work performed for offshore and international exploration and production projects partially offset some of the decline in the U.S. market.\nWe continue to focus on large-scale core analyses and reservoir fluids characterization studies in the Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, along with Guyana, Surinam, Malaysia and other international locations such as offshore South America, Australia, and the Middle East, including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and other countries. Analysis of crude oil and crude oil-derived products also occurs in every major producing region of the world.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nProduct sales revenue, which is primarily tied to the completion of onshore wells in North America, was $110.8 million in 2020, a decrease from $194.0 million and $214 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Rig count is one indicator of activity levels associated with the exploration and production of oil and gas. The rig count for North America significantly decreased in excess of 50% from 2019 to 2020 and decreased from 2018 to 2019 by 12%. Our products sales revenue decreased 43% from 2019 to 2020, and decreased 9% from 2018 to 2019, primarily due to our differentiated well completion products.\nCost of Services, excluding depreciation\nCost of services decreased to $279.3 million in 2020 compared to $345.6 million and $343.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a percentage of services revenue, cost of services increased to 74% in 2020 from 73% and 71% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in cost of services in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to a significant decline in client activity levels and employee compensation and related charges associated with cost reduction initiatives implemented by the Company during the year. A slight increase in cost of services in 2019 from 2018, was primarily due to employee compensation and related charges. Cost of services expressed as a percentage of services revenue, is primarily reflective of how our cost structure is absorbed by revenue, and the timing of implementation of cost reduction initiatives executed by the Company in responding to the adverse changes in client activity levels.\nCost of Product Sales, excluding depreciation\nCost of product sales of $95.5 million in 2020 decreased from $150.0 million and $153.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Given product sales are primarily associated with our Production Enhancement segment and the North American market, cost of sales is impacted by decreased activities associated with clients operating in these segments and geographic markets. As a percentage of product sales revenue, cost of sales increased to 86% for 2020 from 77% and 72% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cost of product sales expressed as a percentage of product sales revenue is primarily reflective of how our fixed costs are absorbed by revenue. Due to the significant decrease in product sales revenue in 2020, fixed costs increased as a percentage of total cost of product sales and product sales revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense, excluding depreciation\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses include corporate management and centralized administrative services that benefit our operations. G&A expenses were $34.0 million in 2020 compared to $48.0 million and $62.9 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. The variances are primarily due to changes in compensation expense during those periods, including accelerated stock compensation expense of $6.7 million in 2020, $7.2 million in 2019 and $9.9 million in 2018 recorded for retirement eligible employees. During 2020, due to the significant adverse impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, certain performance metrics associated with long-term stock-based performance awards were not achieved, resulting in potential employee stock awards above the target level not vesting or being issued in 2020. However, the Company's Compensation Committee approved a modification to the methodology of measuring performance conditions associated with target level long-term employee stock-based compensation awards, which vested at target levels on December 31, 2020. As a result of the stock-based awards not vesting above the target levels and modifications to the performance measures, the value of the stock-based awards that did vest on December 31, 2020 were revalued, and $11.9 million of previously recognized stock compensation expense was reversed in 2020, out of which $11.3 million was recorded in G&A expenses and $0.6 million recorded in cost of sales. See Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense of $20.9 million in 2020 is down compared to $22.6 million and $23.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of decreased capital expenditures.\nImpairments, inventory write-down and other charges\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting sharp decrease in the price of crude oil, which caused a sharp decrease in the consumption and demand for crude oil, led to a triggering event in March 2020. In response to the triggering event, the Company updated its analysis associated with future cash flows and the valuation of assets and potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Our updated analysis resulted in the Company recording a charge of $114.0 million for impairment of goodwill and $8.2 million for impairments to\nintangible assets in March 2020 in our Production Enhancement segment. In addition, we recorded a charge of $10.4 million associated with inventory obsolescence and a valuation write-down related to our Production Enhancement segment.\nThere were no other triggering events during the year, and based on our annual assessment for the year ended December 31, 2020, we determined there was no further impairment for any of our reporting units or asset groups.\nOther

compared to $14.7 million and $13.3 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, the Company reduced outstanding debt under its Credit Facility by $46.0 million, however additional interest expense was incurred to modify the revolving credit agreement in 2020 which also includes higher interest rate spreads when compared to the previous terms under revolving credit agreement. The increase in interest expense in 2019 when compared to 2018 is primarily due to increased average borrowing under our Credit Facility in 2019 compared to 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective tax rate was (6.5)%, (15.0)%, and 24.2% for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Income tax expense of $5.9 million in 2020 increased by $18.1 million compared to a $12.3 million benefit in 2019 primarily due to a large impairment charge of $122.2 million in the first quarter of 2020, of which a substantial portion was not deductible for tax purposes. A $5.5 million benefit was recognized associated with this impairment. In contrast, a benefit of $60.7 million was recognized in 2019 related to corporate restructuring which was partially offset by a charge of $26.7 million related to unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we no longer consider to be indefinitely reinvested.\nSee Note 10 - Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of income tax expense.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn a continuing effort to streamline our business and align our business strategy for further integration of services and products, the Company committed to divest our full range of permanent downhole monitoring systems and related services, which had been part of our Production Enhancement segment. We entered into the definitive purchase agreement on June 7, 2019 for the divestiture of this business, and during the year ended December 31, 2020, we concluded final adjustments to the purchase agreement of the sold business.\nSee Note 20 - Discontinued Operations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSegment Analysis\nThe following charts and tables summarize the annual revenue and operating results for our two complementary business segments.\nSegment Revenue\nSegment Revenue\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reservoir Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 355,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15.6)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 420,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 413,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production Enhancement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 132,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (46.5)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 247,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 287,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 487,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 668,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.7)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 700,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment Operating Income (Loss)\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reservoir Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.2)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production Enhancement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (133,449)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (39.1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate and other (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (76,805)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 96,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18.5)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) \"Corporate and other\" represents those items that are not directly relating to a particular segment.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \"NM\" means not meaningful.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment Operating Income (Loss) Margins (1)\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reservoir Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production Enhancement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.9)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15.8)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) Calculated by dividing \"Operating Income (Loss)\" by \"Revenue\".\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReservoir Description\nRevenue for our Reservoir Description segment decreased to $355.0 million in 2020 compared to $420.9 million and $413.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Reservoir Description's operations are heavily exposed to international and offshore project activity levels, with approximately 80% of its revenue sourced outside the U.S. In 2019, our client's activity levels in the international markets had modestly increased when compared to 2018. However, in early 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic began, global economies were locked down in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus and demand for crude oil decreased sharply. The sharp decrease in demand and challenges to remain operational during the global pandemic caused many adverse impacts to the energy industry, our clients and the Company. Revenue was also adversely impacted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to focus on large-scale core analyses and reservoir fluids characterization studies in the Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, along with Guyana, Suriname, Malaysia and other international locations such as offshore South America, Australia, and the Middle East, including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and other countries. Analysis of crude oil and crude oil-derived products also occurs in every major producing region of the world.\nOperating income of $55.0 million remained relatively flat in 2020 compared to $55.1 million in 2019 and from $54.8 million in 2018. Although there was a significant decline in our client's activity levels and the Company's revenue in 2020 caused by the factors indicated above, operating income was less affected as the Company implemented significant cost reductions in 2020, and as a result of reversing previously recognized stock compensation expense for certain employees' PSAP awards of $7.6 million. See Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. The increased operating income in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to improved activity levels associated with large projects in international markets. However, the improved operating income for 2019 was partially offset by additional expenses associated with employee severance and other cost reduction initiatives of $4.0 million. Included in both 2019 and 2018 are additional stock compensation expense of $4.7 million in 2019 for retirement eligible employees compared to $6.3 million in 2018. See Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. Operating margins improved to 15.5% in 2020 compared to 13.1% and 13.3% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Operating margins in 2020 improved due to a significant decrease in costs of services as a result of cost reduction initiatives implemented and the reduction of stock-based compensation expense described above.\nProduction Enhancement\nRevenue for our Production Enhancement segment of $132.2 million in 2020 decreased compared to $247.3 million and $287.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, a sharp decrease of drilling and well completion activities in the U.S. onshore market was primarily due to impact of the global pandemic as described above. The U.S. rig count decreased in excess of 50% during 2020 as compared to 2019 and decreased 12% in 2019 when compared to 2018. Our clients continue to seek technological solutions for increasing daily production and estimated ultimate recoveries from their reservoirs and we continue to benefit from our clients' acceptance of new services and products which were led by the HERO\u00ae PerFRAC, GoGunTM, FLOWPROFILER EDSTM and ReFRAC technologies.\nOur Production Enhancement segment had operating loss of $133.4 million in 2020 compared to operating income of $38.4 million and $63.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The operating loss in 2020 was primarily the result of non-cash charges of $122.2 million for impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets, a charge in excess of $10.0 million for inventory valuation write-down and obsolescence, and severance expense of $2.6 million recorded during the year. This operating loss was partially offset by the benefit of cost reduction initiatives implemented during 2020 and reversal of previously recognized stock compensation expense associated with certain employees' long term stock-based performance awards of $3.6 million. See Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in operating income from 2018 to 2019, is primarily due to a decrease in exploration and production activity in the U.S. onshore market over this time period.\nOperating margin was negative 101% in 2020, which was the result of a significant decrease in revenue combined with the goodwill impairment, asset impairments and inventory charges recorded as described above. Operating margin for 2020 were breakeven, when excluding the non-cash charges associated with the goodwill impairment, asset impairment and inventory write down. Operating margins in 2019 and 2018 were 15.5% and 21.9%, respectively, and decreased primarily due to lower revenue in 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nWe have historically financed our activities through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, bank credit facilities, equity financing and the issuance of debt. Cash flows from operating activities provide the primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and our dividend and share repurchase programs. We believe our future cash flows from\noperations, supplemented by our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and the ability to issue additional equity and debt, should be sufficient to fund our debt requirements, capital expenditures, working capital, dividend payments and future acquisitions. The Company will continue to monitor and evaluate the availability of debt and equity markets.\nIn response to market conditions, Core Lab's Supervisory Board approved a plan to reduce the Company's quarterly dividends to $0.01 per share beginning with the second quarter of 2020 and to focus excess free cash flow on debt reduction. In March 2020, the Company implemented cost reduction initiatives and expanded these initiatives in June 2020, which included: (i) corporate and operating cost reductions; (ii) annual capital expenditures reduced to approximately $12 million, and (iii) eliminating all non-essential costs. The corporate and operating cost reductions included reductions in workforce and reduction of senior executive and employee compensation. Specifically, the Company has reduced senior executives' annual base salary by 20% for the foreseeable future. On June 22, 2020, also in response to market conditions, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Facility. The Amendment provides, among other things, an increase to the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the Credit Facility for certain periods. See Note 9 - Long-Term Debt, Net of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, on October 16, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement (the 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement\u201d) to issue $60 million in notes (the 2020 Senior Notes\u201d) in a private placement, which were issued and funded at the closing on January 12, 2021. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes to reduce outstanding debt under the Company's Credit Facility, which increased the available borrowing capacity and liquidity for Core Lab. We intend to maintain sufficient borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility to both retire the maturing debt obligations in September 2021, and provide additional liquidity, should the company require it for other purposes. See Note 9 - Long-Term Debt, Net of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAs we are a Netherlands holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries. Our cash availability is largely dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to us and on the terms and conditions of our existing and future credit arrangements. There are no restrictions preventing any of our subsidiaries from repatriating earnings, and there are no restrictions or income taxes associated with distributing cash to the parent company through loans or advances. As of December 31, 2020, $8.8 million of our $13.8 million of cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries, including the U.S.\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\" or \"GAAP\"). We utilize the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow to evaluate our cash flows and results of operations. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure) less cash paid for capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and operating activities. Free cash flow is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation nor construed as an alternative to operating profit, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for distribution because we may have other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. Moreover, since free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and thus is susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations, free cash flow, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The following table reconciles this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP (in thousands):\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Free Cash Flow Calculation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 111,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: cash paid for capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,880\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,269\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21,741\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Free cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 90,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in free cash flow in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to a decrease in activity levels and cash generated from operations, and cash payments for employee post-retirement benefits funded by previously purchased company-owned life insurance policies, offset by a decrease in working capital and capital spending. The decrease in free cash flow in 2019 compared to 2018 was also due to lower operational activity levels in 2019, but also an increase in working capital and a slight increase in capital expenditures in 2019.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes cash flows (in thousands):\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by/(used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 111,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,677\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (70,639\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63,005\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85,874\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (42,472\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,024\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,284\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decreases in cash provided by operating activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to significant decreases in activity levels and operating income due to the impact of the COVID-19 and cash payments for employee post-retirement benefits funded by previously purchased company-owned life insurance policies, partially offset by benefits from cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2020 and a decrease in working capital. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to decreased operating income as the activity levels for the U.S. onshore oil and gas market declined.\nCash provided by investing activities was $7.9 million in 2020 compared to cash used in investing activities of $5.7 million in 2019. The increase in cash flows from investing activities in 2020 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures in 2020 of $11.9 million, a decrease of $10.4 million when compared to 2019 capital expenditures, and cash received from company-owned life insurance policies of $20.4 million in 2020, compared to proceeds from the divesture of two businesses totaling $17.8 million in 2019. Cash used in investing activities in 2019 decreased $65.0 million compared to 2018, as 2018 included an acquisition, net of cash, for $47.3 million, and 2019 includes proceeds from the divestiture of two businesses as indicated above.\nCash used in financing activities in 2020 decreased $22.9 million compared to 2019. In 2020, dividends paid were reduced by $85.1 million, of which $46 million were used to repay of debt borrowings, which compares to $15 million provided by proceeds from debt borrowings in 2019. Cash used in financing activities in 2019 increased $43.4 million compared to 2018. During 2019, we used $3.3 million to repurchase our common shares, $97.6 million to pay dividends, and increased our debt balance by $15 million. During 2018, we used $7.5 million to repurchase our common shares, $97.3 million to pay dividends, and increased our debt balance by $64 million, primarily to fund the acquisition of a business in 2018 for $48.9 million.\nDuring 2020, we repurchased 100,929 shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of $2.8 million, or an average price of $27.68 per share. The repurchase of shares in the open market is at the discretion of management pursuant to shareholder authorization. We regard these treasury shares as a temporary investment which may be used to fund long-term employee stock-based compensation plans or to finance future acquisitions. Under Dutch law and subject to certain Dutch statutory provisions and shareholder approval, we can hold a maximum of 50% of our issued shares in treasury. We currently have shareholder approval to hold 10% of our issued share capital in treasury. On May 20, 2020 at our annual shareholders meeting, our shareholders authorized the extension of our share repurchase program until November 20, 2021 to purchase up to 10% of our issued share capital. We believe this share repurchase program has been beneficial to our shareholders. Our share price has increased from $4.03 per share in 2002, when we began to repurchase shares, to $26.51 per share on December 31, 2020, an increase of 558%.\nCredit Facility and Available Future Liquidity\nIn 2011, we issued two series of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $150 million (\"2011 Senior Notes\") in a private placement transaction. Series A consists of $75 million in aggregate principal amount of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.01% and are due in full on September 30, 2021. Series B consists of $75 million in aggregate principal amount of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.11% and are due in full on September 30, 2023. Interest on each series of the 2011 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on March 30 and September 30.\nOn June 22, 2020, we entered into the Amendment to the Credit Facility. The Amendment increases the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the Credit Facility for certain periods. Pursuant to the terms of the Amendment, the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the Credit Facility is as follows:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> Quarter ending\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maximum leverage ratio permitted\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> June 30, 2020 up to and including June 30, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 30, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2021 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMoreover, the Amendment modified the range of variable interest rates that the Credit Facility may bear to be a range from LIBOR plus 1.500% to LIBOR plus 2.875% and included the addition of a LIBOR floor of 0.50%. The Amendment also reduced the aggregate borrowing commitment under the Credit Facility to $225 million and the amount by which we may elect to increase the facility size, known as the accordion\u201d feature, to $50 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Interest payment terms are variable depending upon the specific type of borrowing under this facility.\nAny outstanding balance under the Credit Facility is due on maturity on June 19, 2023. Our available capacity at any point in time is reduced by outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit which totaled $12.9 million, resulting in an available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility of $101.1 million, at December 31, 2020. In addition to indebtedness under the Credit Facility, we had $6.1 million of outstanding letters of credit and performance guarantees and bonds from other sources as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Credit Facility remains unsecured, and contains customary representations, warranties, terms and conditions for similar types of facilities. The terms of the Credit Facility and 2011 Senior Notes require us to meet certain covenants, including, but not limited to, an interest coverage ratio (calculated as consolidated EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage ratio (calculated as consolidated net indebtedness divided by consolidated EBITDA), where consolidated EBITDA (as defined in each agreement) and interest expense are calculated using the most recent four fiscal quarters. The Credit Facility and 2011 Senior Notes each include a cross-default provision, whereby a default under one agreement may trigger a default in the other agreement. The Credit Facility has the more restrictive covenants with a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and permits a maximum leverage ratio as described above. The Credit Facility allows non-cash charges such as impairment of assets, stock compensation and other non-cash charges to be added back in the calculation of consolidated EBITDA. The terms of our Credit Facility also allow us to negotiate in good faith to amend any ratio or requirement to preserve the original intent of the agreement if any change in accounting principles would affect the computation of any financial ratio or covenant of the Credit Facility. In accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility, our leverage ratio is 2.82, and our interest coverage ratio is 6.09, each for the period ended December 31, 2020. We believe that we are in compliance with all covenants contained in our Credit Facility and 2011 Senior Notes. Our parent, Core Laboratories N.V., together with certain of our material, wholly-owned subsidiaries are guarantors or co-borrowers under the Credit Facility and 2011 Senior Notes.\nWe entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $50 million to hedge changes in the variable rate interest expense on $50 million of our existing or replacement LIBOR-priced debt. Under the first swap agreement of $25 million, we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 2.50% through August 29, 2024. In February 2020, we entered into the second swap agreement of $25 million, under which we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 1.3% through February 28, 2025. Each swap is measured at fair value and recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability. They are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments and are highly effective. Unrealized losses are deferred to shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in income as an increase or decrease to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense On October 16, 2020, we, along with Core Laboratories (U.S.) Interests Holdings, Inc. as issuer, entered into the 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement. The 2020 Senior Notes were issued and funded on January 12, 2021. The Company used the $60 million in proceeds from issuing the 2020 Senior Notes to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. Series A of the 2020 Senior Notes consists of $45 million in aggregate principal amount that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.09% and are due in full on January 12, 2026. Series B of the 2020 Senior Notes consists of $15 million in aggregate principal amount that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.38% and are due in full on January 12, 2028. Interest on each series of the 2020 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on June 30 and December 30, commencing on June 30, 2021.\nThe terms of the 2020 Senior Notes require us to meet certain covenants, including, but not limited to, an interest coverage ratio (calculated as consolidated EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage ratio (calculated as consolidated net indebtedness divided by consolidated EBITDA), where consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement) and interest expense are calculated using the most recent four fiscal quarters; and a priority indebtedness ratio (calculated as Priority Indebtedness divided by Consolidated Total Assets (as defined in the 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement.) The financial covenants for the 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement are aligned with the Credit Facility and the associated 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement also allows renegotiation of the ratios in consideration of changes in accounting principles. We along with certain of our material, wholly-owned subsidiaries, are guarantors or co-borrowers under the 2020 Senior Notes.\nOn December 17, 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC for the issuance and sale of up to $60.0 million of our common shares. Under terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the sales of our common shares may be made by any method deemed to be an at-the-market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company elects when to issue a placement notice which may, among other sales parameters, specify the number of shares to be sold, the minimum price per share to be accepted, the daily volume of shares that may be sold and the range of dates when shares may be sold. There have been no sales under the agreement as of December 31, 2020, or for the time period from January 1, 2021 through February 5, 2021.\nIn addition to our repayment commitments under our Credit Facility and our 2011 Senior Notes, we have non-cancellable operating lease arrangements under which we lease office and lab space, machinery, equipment and vehicles.\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations under these arrangements (in thousands):\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 261,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 186,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pension (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 329,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 204,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) Not included in the above balances are anticipated cash payments for interest of $6.1 million a year for 2020-2021 and cash\npayments for interest of $3.1 million a year for 2022-2023 for a total of $18.4 million.

Not included in the table above are uncertain tax positions of $6.3 million that we have accrued for at December 31, 2020, as the amounts and timing of payment, if any, are uncertain. See Note 10 - Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of this amount.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had tax net operating loss carry-forwards in various jurisdictions of $62.3 million. Although we cannot be certain that these operating loss carry-forwards will be utilized, we anticipate that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to allow us to fully utilize the carry-forwards that are not subject to a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020. If unused, those carry-forwards which are subject to expiration may expire during the years 2021-2030. During 2020, we have no net operating loss carry-forwards, which carried a full valuation allowance, that expired unused.\nWe expect our investment in capital expenditures to track client demand for our services and products. Given the uncertain trend in industry activity levels, we have not determined, at this time, the level of investment that will be made in 2021. We will, however, continue to invest to fund the purchase of instrumentation, tools and equipment along with expenditures to replace obsolete or worn-out instrumentation, tools and equipment, to consolidate certain facilities to gain operational efficiencies, and to increase our presence where requested by our clients.\nOutlook\nThe events occurring during 2020 associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and government mandated business shut-downs around the world, home sheltering and social distancing policies have caused a significant decline in the demand for crude oil and associated products. The significant decline in demand has resulted in a significant decline in the price of crude oil, which has also resulted in a high degree of uncertainty about future demand and the future price for crude oil as long as the virus concerns persist. U.S. onshore drilling and completion activity have experienced the most significant impact, as the rig count and completion of wells have declined significantly during 2020 from previous year levels. International activity has also been impacted by disruption to our clients' operations and a significant decline in the international rig count. Additionally, our clients experienced disruptions from a record number of named tropical weather systems in the Gulf of Mexico during 2020. Although physical damage to Core Lab's facilities was minor; our clients experienced interruptions of business activity due to pre-storm preparations, offshore facility evacuations, local area flooding, power outages, and post-storm clean-up.\nWhile the full impact of COVID-19 on our business and the long-term worldwide impact still remains unknown, Core Laboratories has continued to operate as an essential business with timely delivery of products and services to our clients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued government restrictions, widespread growth in infections, travel restrictions, quarantines, and mandated site closures have led to disruptions in business workflows, which are expected to continue into 2021. These disruptions have primarily been associated with operational workflows stemming from travel, product delivery and installation, as well as suspensions and delays in client projects. We have not experienced any significant disruptions in our supply chain, and do not anticipate significant disruption in our supply chain. We also maintained and refreshed our continuity plan across our global organization to protect the health of employees while servicing clients.\nAs part of our long-term growth strategy, we continue our efforts to expand our market presence by opening or expanding facilities in strategic areas and realizing synergies within our business lines subject to client demand and market conditions. We\nbelieve our market presence provides us a unique opportunity to service clients who have global operations whether they are international oil companies, national oil companies, or independent oil companies.\nOur major clients continue to focus on capital management, return on invested capital ( ROIC\u201d), free cash flow, and returning capital back to their shareholders, as opposed to a heavier focus on growing production. The companies adopting value versus volume metrics tend to be the more technologically sophisticated operators and form the foundation of Core Lab's worldwide client base. Considering a longer-term strategy, we expect to be well positioned as our clients continue their focus on employing higher technological solutions in their efforts to optimize production and estimated ultimate recovery (\"EUR\") in the most cost efficient, environmentally responsible, manner. We believe operators will continue to manage their capital spending within reduced budgets and maintain their focus on strengthening their balance sheets and generating positive free cash flow.\nInternational field development spending was impacted by reduced operating budgets in response to declines in demand tied to COVID-19. Reservoir Description continues to work with clients and discuss the progression of longer-term international projects. Longer-term international and offshore projects are expected to continue and are not as susceptible or at-risk due to shorter-term volatility in crude oil commodity price. International and offshore activity are expected to gradually improve as the pandemic abates, but the timing of this improvement remains unclear. Additionally, the reservoir fluids analysis that is performed on projects associated with current producing fields, continues to be critical and will be less affected by lower commodity prices for crude oil. The adverse impact from COVID-19 and the depression of crude-oil prices has resulted in increased uncertainty associated with the activity levels and revenue opportunities from these international and offshore projects, however most of the larger projects, especially the projects that have already been commissioned and are in development, are focused on a longer term forecast versus a short to mid-term assessment of the crude oil commodity prices.\nU.S. onshore actively levels were most significantly impacted and reached historically low levels by mid-2020. However, U.S. onshore activity levels began to recover during the second half of the year, although not to the same levels preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. Assuming the situation with the COVID-19 virus improves across the globe and crude oil commodity prices remain at current levels or improve, we believe the U.S. onshore activity will gradually improve during 2021.\nIn response to market conditions, Core Lab's Supervisory Board approved a plan to reduce the Company's quarterly dividends to $0.01 per share beginning with the second quarter of 2020 and to focus excess free cash flows towards the reduction of debt. In March 2020, the Company implemented cost reduction initiatives and expanded these initiatives in June 2020, which included: (i) corporate and operating cost reductions; (ii) annual capital expenditures reduced to approximately $12 million, and (iii) eliminating all non-essential costs. The corporate and operating cost reductions included reductions in workforce and reduction of senior executive and employee compensation. Specifically, the Company has reduced senior executives' annual base salary by 20% for the foreseeable future. Although activities have declined and remained low in second half of 2020 due to the factors discussed above, this decline has been partially offset by the effectiveness of the Company's cost control initiatives. Lastly, the net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes, issued on January 12, 2021, were used exclusively to reduce outstanding debt and increase liquidity under the Company's Credit Facility as we work towards our long-term strategy of reducing debt.\nCore Lab believes these immediate actions, as well as continued assessment of market conditions, will allow Core Lab, as it has for over 83 years, to navigate through these challenging times. Core Lab remains focused on preserving the quality of service for its clients and producing returns for its shareholders.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and determine the adequacy of our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. By nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it is highly subjective and if changes in the estimate under different assumptions would result in a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The following transaction types require significant judgment and, therefore, are considered critical accounting policies as of December 31, 2020.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense includes income taxes of the Netherlands, the U.S. and other foreign countries as well as local, state and provincial income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the asset is expected to be recovered or the liability is expected to be settled. We estimate the likelihood of the recoverability of our\ndeferred tax assets (particularly, net operating loss carry-forwards). Any valuation allowance recorded is based on estimates and assumptions of taxable income into the future and a determination is made of the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized. Valuation allowances of our net deferred tax assets aggregated to $6.3 million and $6.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and our effective tax rate may increase which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We have not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that we consider to be indefinitely reinvested. Should we make a distribution of the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries, we may be required to record additional taxes. We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax return. We also recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nLong-Lived Assets, Intangibles and Goodwill\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. They are depreciated using the straight-line method based on their individual estimated useful lives, except for leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the remaining lease term, if shorter. We estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our assets based on historical data of similar assets. When long-lived assets are sold or retired, the remaining costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income. These capitalized long-lived assets could become impaired if our operating plans or business environment changes.\nIntangible assets, including patents, trademarks and technology, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangibles with determinable lives are amortized using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of the intangible. Intangibles with indeterminable lives, which consist primarily of corporate trade names, are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment is possible. We recorded an impairment charge of $8.2 million for certain intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2020. We did not record any material impairment charges relating to intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nWe review our long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible and right-of-use assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recovered over their remaining service lives. Indicators of possible impairment may include significant declines in activity levels in regions where specific assets or groups of assets are located, extended periods of idle use, declining revenue or cash flow or overall changes in general market conditions.\nWhenever possible impairment is indicated, we compare the carrying value of the assets to the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from use, plus salvage value, less the costs of the subsequent disposition of the assets. If impairment is still indicated, we compare the fair value of the assets to the carrying amount, and recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. We did not record any material impairment charges relating to our long-lived assets held for use during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nWe record goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. We test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment.\nWe evaluated our goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units, which are our reportable segments, to their net carrying value as of the balance sheet date. We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted future cash flow analysis. Estimated future cash flows were based on the Company's best estimate of future performance. Our impairment analysis is both qualitative and quantitative, and includes subjective estimates based on assumptions regarding future revenue growth rates, discount rate and expected margins. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value determined, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We recorded an impairment charge of $114.0 million for goodwill of one of our reporting units during the year ended December 31, 2020. We did not record impairment charges relating to our goodwill or our indefinite-lived intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have two stock-based compensation plans, as described in further detail in Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate the probability that certain of our stock-based plans will meet targets established within the respective agreements and result in the vesting of such awards. For new awards issued and awards modified, repurchased or canceled, the compensation expense is equal to the fair value of the award at the date of the grant and is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for those awards over the requisite service period of the\naward. The fair value is determined by calculating the share price on the date of grant less the discounted value of the expected dividends to be paid over the vesting period.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements such as securitization agreements, liquidity trust vehicles or special purpose entities. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K and the documents incorporated in this Form 10-K by reference contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These \"forward-looking statements\" are based on an analysis of currently available competitive, financial and economic data and our operating plans.

The new standard establishes a\nright-of-use (\"ROU\") model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11 (\"Targeted Improvements to Leases\"), which provides companies with an additional transition method that allows the effects of the adoption of the new standard to be recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. We elected this optional transition method for adoption. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2019 had a material impact to our Consolidated Balance Sheet, but not to our Consolidated Statement of Operations or Cash Flows. The most significant impact was the recognition of $77.5 million of ROU assets and liabilities for operating leases, while our accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged.\nPronouncements Adopted in 2020\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 (\"Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\") which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2020, and there has been no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or on our accounting policies and processes.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 ( Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\u201d) which eliminates a step in computing the implied fair value of goodwill with a new methodology of an entity performing an annual goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2020. The new methodology was applied for the interim goodwill impairment analysis performed upon the triggering event of the COVID-19 pandemic during the three month period ended March 31, 2020, and it did not change the conclusion that goodwill had been impaired. There has been no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or on our accounting policies and processes as a result of adopting this updated accounting standard.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCore Laboratories N.V. is a Netherlands limited liability company. We were established in 1936 and are one of the world's leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description and production enhancement services and products to the oil and gas industry, primarily through client relationships with many of the world's major, national and independent oil companies.\nWe operate our business in two reporting segments. These complementary segments provide different services and products and utilize different technologies for evaluating and improving reservoir performance and increasing oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields:\n \u2022 Reservoir Description: Encompasses the characterization of petroleum reservoir rock and reservoir fluids samples to increase production and improve recovery of crude oil and natural gas from our clients' reservoirs. We provide laboratory-based analytical and field services to characterize properties of crude oil and crude oil-derived products to the oil and gas industry. We also provide proprietary and joint industry studies based on these types of analyses and manufacture associated laboratory equipment. \n \u2022 Production Enhancement: Includes services and manufactured products relating to reservoir well completions, perforations, stimulation and production. We provide integrated diagnostic services to evaluate and monitor the effectiveness of well completions and to develop solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery projects. \nGeneral Overview\nWe provide services as well as design and produce products which enable our clients to evaluate and improve reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields. These services and products are generally in higher demand when our clients are investing capital in their field development programs that are designed to increase productivity from existing fields or when exploring for appraising and developing new fields. Our clients' investment in capital expenditure programs tends to correlate over the longer term to oil and natural gas commodity prices. During periods of higher, stable prices, our clients generally invest more in capital expenditures and, during periods of lower or volatile commodity prices, they tend to invest less. Consequently, the level of capital expenditures by our clients impacts the demand for our services and products.\nThe following table summarizes the annual average and year-end worldwide and U.S. rig counts for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, as well as the annual average and year-end spot price of a barrel of WTI crude, Europe Brent crude and an MMBtu of natural gas:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Baker Hughes Worldwide Average Rig Count (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,177\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Baker Hughes U.S. Average Rig Count (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Baker Hughes Worldwide Year-End Rig Count (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Baker Hughes U.S. Year-End Rig Count (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Crude Oil Price per Barrel WTI (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65.23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Crude Oil Price per Barrel Brent (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 71.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average Natural Gas Price per MMBtu (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year-end Crude Oil Price per Barrel WTI (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year-end Crude Oil Price per Barrel Brent (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year-end Natural Gas Price per MMBtu (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) Twelve month average rig count as reported by Baker Hughes - Worldwide Rig Count.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (2) Year-end rig count as reported by Baker Hughes - Worldwide Rig Count.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (3) Average daily and year-end West Texas Intermediate crude spot price as reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (\"EIA\").\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (4) Average daily and year-end Europe Brent crude spot price as reported by the EIA.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (5) Average daily and year-end Henry Hub natural gas spot price as reported by the EIA.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe prices for both WTI and Brent crude oil declined from 2018 to 2019 and decreased significantly at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and throughout the second quarter of 2020, due to the outbreak of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated government mandated shut-downs around the world, home sheltering and social distancing policies, have caused a significant decline in the demand for crude oil and associated products. Crude-oil prices improved during the second half of 2020, and became more stable during the fourth quarter of the year. The end result was the average price for crude oil in 2020 was approximately 33% lower than the average price for 2019. In general, activities associated with the exploration of oil and\ngas in the U.S. onshore market are more sensitive to changes in the crude-oil commodity prices, as opposed to larger international and offshore projects which take multiple years to plan and develop, and once announced and started, will continue through completion, despite changes in the current price of crude oil. Crude-oil prices in 2018 and 2019 remained at levels sufficient to support more stable levels in U.S. onshore activities associated with both the exploration and production of crude oil. Additionally, during the 2018 - 2019 time period, public announcements of investments in larger international and offshore projects increased and activity levels on these larger international and offshore projects began to improve in 2018 and continued to improve into 2019. However, in early 2020, the impact of COVID-19 to global economies caused a significant and sharp decline in demand for crude oil, which resulted in a significant and sharp decrease in the price of crude oil. Activity levels in the U.S. onshore market also responded immediately and decreased significantly to historically low levels, which bottomed in the summer of 2020, but showed some recovery in the second half of the year as global demand partially recovered, global production of crude oil was reduced and crude oil prices showed some recovery. Information published by the EIA, shows that the inventory of wells drilled but uncompleted (a DUC\u201d well) was 7,543 as of December 31, 2018, increasing to a peak in July 2019 at approximately 8,533, however, it subsequently declined to 7,782 and 7,592 at end of 2019 and 2020, respectively. This data indicates that during the period of higher activity in 2018, operators were drilling wells but not completing them as the DUC inventory grew. However, as activity levels began to fall in the second half of 2019, and a sharper decline in 2020, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, the operators began to drill fewer new wells, but were completing some of the wells that had been previously drilled, which is reflected in the lower DUC inventory at December 2019 and 2020.\nIn North America, the land-based rig count decreased over 11% from 2018 to 2019. There was subsequently a significant decline of 51% in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19. Consequently, the magnitude of decline in demand for both services and product sales to this market responded in line with the changes over this time period. The increase in activities on development projects and producing fields in the U.S. unconventional reservoirs during 2018 showed a decline when the commodity price weakened and activity levels decreased in 2019. In the U.S., the lower commodity prices led to a 54% decrease in the annual average land-based rig count and a decline in U.S. based activities in 2020.\nOutside of North America, activities associated with the exploration for and production of oil were showing modest improvement in 2018 and 2019 until the global pandemic emerged in early 2020. The decrease in global demand for crude oil caused by the global pandemic also had a significant impact on exploration and production activities in the international markets as the number of active rigs outside the United States decreased almost 39% during 2020. Long-term international and offshore projects which are commonly announced through Final Investment Decisions and subsequently initiated are not susceptible or at-risk to delay or suspension due to short-term volatility in crude-oil commodity price, however the extreme negative market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to reduce the spread of the virus have negatively impacted the entire energy market in 2020.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nWe evaluate our operating results by analyzing revenue, operating income and operating income margin (defined as operating income divided by total revenue). Since we have a relatively fixed cost structure, decreases in revenue generally translate into lower operating income results. Results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are summarized in the following chart:\nResults of operations as a percentage of applicable revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020,

is primarily tied to activities associated with the exploration and production of oil and gas outside the U.S., decreased to $376.4 million in 2020 from $474.2 million in 2019 and $486.8 million in 2018. In 2020, the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and government mandated shut-down around the world, home sheltering and social distancing policies caused a sharp decline in the demand for crude-oil and associated products. The average crude-oil price in 2020 was 33% lower than the average price of 2019. This resulted in decreased and disrupted activity by our clients and disruptions to our revenue generating operational activities leading to a sharp decrease in service revenue in both the U.S. and international markets during most of 2020. Crude-oil prices weakened in 2019 with the average price of 10% lower than the average price in 2018. This resulted in decreased activity by our clients leading to lower service revenue in the North America onshore market during 2019 compared to 2018. However, improvement in the level of work performed for offshore and international exploration and production projects partially offset some of the decline in the U.S. market.\nWe continue to focus on large-scale core analyses and reservoir fluids characterization studies in the Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, along with Guyana, Surinam, Malaysia and other international locations such as offshore South America, Australia, and the Middle East, including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and other countries. Analysis of crude oil and crude oil-derived products also occurs in every major producing region of the world.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nProduct sales revenue, which is primarily tied to the completion of onshore wells in North America, was $110.8 million in 2020, a decrease from $194.0 million and $214 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Rig count is one indicator of activity levels associated with the exploration and production of oil and gas. The rig count for North America significantly decreased in excess of 50% from 2019 to 2020 and decreased from 2018 to 2019 by 12%. Our products sales revenue decreased 43% from 2019 to 2020, and decreased 9% from 2018 to 2019, primarily due to our differentiated well completion products.\nCost of Services, excluding depreciation\nCost of services decreased to $279.3 million in 2020 compared to $345.6 million and $343.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a percentage of services revenue, cost of services increased to 74% in 2020 from 73% and 71% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in cost of services in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to a significant decline in client activity levels and employee compensation and related charges associated with cost reduction initiatives implemented by the Company during the year. A slight increase in cost of services in 2019 from 2018, was primarily due to employee compensation and related charges. Cost of services expressed as a percentage of services revenue, is primarily reflective of how our cost structure is absorbed by revenue, and the timing of implementation of cost reduction initiatives executed by the Company in responding to the adverse changes in client activity levels.\nCost of Product Sales, excluding depreciation\nCost of product sales of $95.5 million in 2020 decreased from $150.0 million and $153.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Given product sales are primarily associated with our Production Enhancement segment and the North American market, cost of sales is impacted by decreased activities associated with clients operating in these segments and geographic markets. As a percentage of product sales revenue, cost of sales increased to 86% for 2020 from 77% and 72% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cost of product sales expressed as a percentage of product sales revenue is primarily reflective of how our fixed costs are absorbed by revenue. Due to the significant decrease in product sales revenue in 2020, fixed costs increased as a percentage of total cost of product sales and product sales revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense, excluding depreciation\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses include corporate management and centralized administrative services that benefit our operations. G&A expenses were $34.0 million in 2020 compared to $48.0 million and $62.9 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. The variances are primarily due to changes in compensation expense during those periods, including accelerated stock compensation expense of $6.7 million in 2020, $7.2 million in 2019 and $9.9 million in 2018 recorded for retirement eligible employees. During 2020, due to the significant adverse impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, certain performance metrics associated with long-term stock-based performance awards were not achieved, resulting in potential employee stock awards above the target level not vesting or being issued in 2020. However, the Company's Compensation Committee approved a modification to the methodology of measuring performance conditions associated with target level long-term employee stock-based compensation awards, which vested at target levels on December 31, 2020. As a result of the stock-based awards not vesting above the target levels and modifications to the performance measures, the value of the stock-based awards that did vest on December 31, 2020 were revalued, and $11.9 million of previously recognized stock compensation expense was reversed in 2020, out of which $11.3 million was recorded in G&A expenses and $0.6 million recorded in cost of sales. See Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense of $20.9 million in 2020 is down compared to $22.6 million and $23.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of decreased capital expenditures.\nImpairments, inventory write-down and other charges\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting sharp decrease in the price of crude oil, which caused a sharp decrease in the consumption and demand for crude oil, led to a triggering event in March 2020. In response to the triggering event, the Company updated its analysis associated with future cash flows and the valuation of assets and potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Our updated analysis resulted in the Company recording a charge of $114.0 million for impairment of goodwill and $8.2 million for impairments to\nintangible assets in March 2020 in our Production Enhancement segment. In addition, we recorded a charge of $10.4 million associated with inventory obsolescence and a valuation write-down related to our Production Enhancement segment.\nThere were no other triggering events during the year, and based on our annual assessment for the year ended December 31, 2020, we determined there was no further impairment for any of our reporting units or asset groups.\nOther

compared to $14.7 million and $13.3 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, the Company reduced outstanding debt under its Credit Facility by $46.0 million, however additional interest expense was incurred to modify the revolving credit agreement in 2020 which also includes higher interest rate spreads when compared to the previous terms under revolving credit agreement. The increase in interest expense in 2019 when compared to 2018 is primarily due to increased average borrowing under our Credit Facility in 2019 compared to 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective tax rate was (6.5)%, (15.0)%, and 24.2% for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Income tax expense of $5.9 million in 2020 increased by $18.1 million compared to a $12.3 million benefit in 2019 primarily due to a large impairment charge of $122.2 million in the first quarter of 2020, of which a substantial portion was not deductible for tax purposes. A $5.5 million benefit was recognized associated with this impairment. In contrast, a benefit of $60.7 million was recognized in 2019 related to corporate restructuring which was partially offset by a charge of $26.7 million related to unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we no longer consider to be indefinitely reinvested.\nSee Note 10 - Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of income tax expense.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn a continuing effort to streamline our business and align our business strategy for further integration of services and products, the Company committed to divest our full range of permanent downhole monitoring systems and related services, which had been part of our Production Enhancement segment. We entered into the definitive purchase agreement on June 7, 2019 for the divestiture of this business, and during the year ended December 31, 2020, we concluded final adjustments to the purchase agreement of the sold business.\nSee Note 20 - Discontinued Operations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSegment Analysis\nThe following charts and tables summarize the annual revenue and operating results for our two complementary business segments.\nSegment Revenue\nSegment Revenue\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reservoir Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 355,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15.6)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 420,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 413,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production Enhancement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 132,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (46.5)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 247,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 287,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 487,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 668,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.7)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 700,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment Operating Income (Loss)\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reservoir Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.2)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production Enhancement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (133,449)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (39.1)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate and other (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (76,805)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 96,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18.5)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) \"Corporate and other\" represents those items that are not directly relating to a particular segment.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \"NM\" means not meaningful.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment Operating Income (Loss) Margins (1)\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reservoir Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production Enhancement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100.9)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15.8)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) Calculated by dividing \"Operating Income (Loss)\" by \"Revenue\".\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReservoir Description\nRevenue for our Reservoir Description segment decreased to $355.0 million in 2020 compared to $420.9 million and $413.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Reservoir Description's operations are heavily exposed to international and offshore project activity levels, with approximately 80% of its revenue sourced outside the U.S. In 2019, our client's activity levels in the international markets had modestly increased when compared to 2018. However, in early 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic began, global economies were locked down in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus and demand for crude oil decreased sharply. The sharp decrease in demand and challenges to remain operational during the global pandemic caused many adverse impacts to the energy industry, our clients and the Company. Revenue was also adversely impacted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to focus on large-scale core analyses and reservoir fluids characterization studies in the Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, along with Guyana, Suriname, Malaysia and other international locations such as offshore South America, Australia, and the Middle East, including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and other countries. Analysis of crude oil and crude oil-derived products also occurs in every major producing region of the world.\nOperating income of $55.0 million remained relatively flat in 2020 compared to $55.1 million in 2019 and from $54.8 million in 2018. Although there was a significant decline in our client's activity levels and the Company's revenue in 2020 caused by the factors indicated above, operating income was less affected as the Company implemented significant cost reductions in 2020, and as a result of reversing previously recognized stock compensation expense for certain employees' PSAP awards of $7.6 million. See Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. The increased operating income in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to improved activity levels associated with large projects in international markets. However, the improved operating income for 2019 was partially offset by additional expenses associated with employee severance and other cost reduction initiatives of $4.0 million. Included in both 2019 and 2018 are additional stock compensation expense of $4.7 million in 2019 for retirement eligible employees compared to $6.3 million in 2018. See Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. Operating margins improved to 15.5% in 2020 compared to 13.1% and 13.3% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Operating margins in 2020 improved due to a significant decrease in costs of services as a result of cost reduction initiatives implemented and the reduction of stock-based compensation expense described above.\nProduction Enhancement\nRevenue for our Production Enhancement segment of $132.2 million in 2020 decreased compared to $247.3 million and $287.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, a sharp decrease of drilling and well completion activities in the U.S. onshore market was primarily due to impact of the global pandemic as described above. The U.S. rig count decreased in excess of 50% during 2020 as compared to 2019 and decreased 12% in 2019 when compared to 2018. Our clients continue to seek technological solutions for increasing daily production and estimated ultimate recoveries from their reservoirs and we continue to benefit from our clients' acceptance of new services and products which were led by the HERO\u00ae PerFRAC, GoGunTM, FLOWPROFILER EDSTM and ReFRAC technologies.\nOur Production Enhancement segment had operating loss of $133.4 million in 2020 compared to operating income of $38.4 million and $63.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The operating loss in 2020 was primarily the result of non-cash charges of $122.2 million for impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets, a charge in excess of $10.0 million for inventory valuation write-down and obsolescence, and severance expense of $2.6 million recorded during the year. This operating loss was partially offset by the benefit of cost reduction initiatives implemented during 2020 and reversal of previously recognized stock compensation expense associated with certain employees' long term stock-based performance awards of $3.6 million. See Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in operating income from 2018 to 2019, is primarily due to a decrease in exploration and production activity in the U.S. onshore market over this time period.\nOperating margin was negative 101% in 2020, which was the result of a significant decrease in revenue combined with the goodwill impairment, asset impairments and inventory charges recorded as described above. Operating margin for 2020 were breakeven, when excluding the non-cash charges associated with the goodwill impairment, asset impairment and inventory write down. Operating margins in 2019 and 2018 were 15.5% and 21.9%, respectively, and decreased primarily due to lower revenue in 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nWe have historically financed our activities through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, bank credit facilities, equity financing and the issuance of debt. Cash flows from operating activities provide the primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and our dividend and share repurchase programs. We believe our future cash flows from\noperations, supplemented by our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and the ability to issue additional equity and debt, should be sufficient to fund our debt requirements, capital expenditures, working capital, dividend payments and future acquisitions. The Company will continue to monitor and evaluate the availability of debt and equity markets.\nIn response to market conditions, Core Lab's Supervisory Board approved a plan to reduce the Company's quarterly dividends to $0.01 per share beginning with the second quarter of 2020 and to focus excess free cash flow on debt reduction. In March 2020, the Company implemented cost reduction initiatives and expanded these initiatives in June 2020, which included: (i) corporate and operating cost reductions; (ii) annual capital expenditures reduced to approximately $12 million, and (iii) eliminating all non-essential costs. The corporate and operating cost reductions included reductions in workforce and reduction of senior executive and employee compensation. Specifically, the Company has reduced senior executives' annual base salary by 20% for the foreseeable future. On June 22, 2020, also in response to market conditions, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Facility. The Amendment provides, among other things, an increase to the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the Credit Facility for certain periods. See Note 9 - Long-Term Debt, Net of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, on October 16, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement (the 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement\u201d) to issue $60 million in notes (the 2020 Senior Notes\u201d) in a private placement, which were issued and funded at the closing on January 12, 2021. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes to reduce outstanding debt under the Company's Credit Facility, which increased the available borrowing capacity and liquidity for Core Lab. We intend to maintain sufficient borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility to both retire the maturing debt obligations in September 2021, and provide additional liquidity, should the company require it for other purposes. See Note 9 - Long-Term Debt, Net of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAs we are a Netherlands holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries. Our cash availability is largely dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to us and on the terms and conditions of our existing and future credit arrangements. There are no restrictions preventing any of our subsidiaries from repatriating earnings, and there are no restrictions or income taxes associated with distributing cash to the parent company through loans or advances. As of December 31, 2020, $8.8 million of our $13.8 million of cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries, including the U.S.\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\" or \"GAAP\"). We utilize the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow to evaluate our cash flows and results of operations. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure) less cash paid for capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and operating activities. Free cash flow is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation nor construed as an alternative to operating profit, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for distribution because we may have other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. Moreover, since free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and thus is susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations, free cash flow, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The following table reconciles this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP (in thousands):\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Free Cash Flow Calculation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 111,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: cash paid for capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,880\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,269\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21,741\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Free cash flow\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 90,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in free cash flow in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to a decrease in activity levels and cash generated from operations, and cash payments for employee post-retirement benefits funded by previously purchased company-owned life insurance policies, offset by a decrease in working capital and capital spending. The decrease in free cash flow in 2019 compared to 2018 was also due to lower operational activity levels in 2019, but also an increase in working capital and a slight increase in capital expenditures in 2019.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes cash flows (in thousands):\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by/(used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 111,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,677\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (70,639\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63,005\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (85,874\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (42,472\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,024\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,284\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decreases in cash provided by operating activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to significant decreases in activity levels and operating income due to the impact of the COVID-19 and cash payments for employee post-retirement benefits funded by previously purchased company-owned life insurance policies, partially offset by benefits from cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2020 and a decrease in working capital. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to decreased operating income as the activity levels for the U.S. onshore oil and gas market declined.\nCash provided by investing activities was $7.9 million in 2020 compared to cash used in investing activities of $5.7 million in 2019. The increase in cash flows from investing activities in 2020 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures in 2020 of $11.9 million, a decrease of $10.4 million when compared to 2019 capital expenditures, and cash received from company-owned life insurance policies of $20.4 million in 2020, compared to proceeds from the divesture of two businesses totaling $17.8 million in 2019. Cash used in investing activities in 2019 decreased $65.0 million compared to 2018, as 2018 included an acquisition, net of cash, for $47.3 million, and 2019 includes proceeds from the divestiture of two businesses as indicated above.\nCash used in financing activities in 2020 decreased $22.9 million compared to 2019. In 2020, dividends paid were reduced by $85.1 million, of which $46 million were used to repay of debt borrowings, which compares to $15 million provided by proceeds from debt borrowings in 2019. Cash used in financing activities in 2019 increased $43.4 million compared to 2018. During 2019, we used $3.3 million to repurchase our common shares, $97.6 million to pay dividends, and increased our debt balance by $15 million. During 2018, we used $7.5 million to repurchase our common shares, $97.3 million to pay dividends, and increased our debt balance by $64 million, primarily to fund the acquisition of a business in 2018 for $48.9 million.\nDuring 2020, we repurchased 100,929 shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of $2.8 million, or an average price of $27.68 per share. The repurchase of shares in the open market is at the discretion of management pursuant to shareholder authorization. We regard these treasury shares as a temporary investment which may be used to fund long-term employee stock-based compensation plans or to finance future acquisitions. Under Dutch law and subject to certain Dutch statutory provisions and shareholder approval, we can hold a maximum of 50% of our issued shares in treasury. We currently have shareholder approval to hold 10% of our issued share capital in treasury. On May 20, 2020 at our annual shareholders meeting, our shareholders authorized the extension of our share repurchase program until November 20, 2021 to purchase up to 10% of our issued share capital. We believe this share repurchase program has been beneficial to our shareholders. Our share price has increased from $4.03 per share in 2002, when we began to repurchase shares, to $26.51 per share on December 31, 2020, an increase of 558%.\nCredit Facility and Available Future Liquidity\nIn 2011, we issued two series of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $150 million (\"2011 Senior Notes\") in a private placement transaction. Series A consists of $75 million in aggregate principal amount of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.01% and are due in full on September 30, 2021. Series B consists of $75 million in aggregate principal amount of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.11% and are due in full on September 30, 2023. Interest on each series of the 2011 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on March 30 and September 30.\nOn June 22, 2020, we entered into the Amendment to the Credit Facility. The Amendment increases the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the Credit Facility for certain periods. Pursuant to the terms of the Amendment, the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the Credit Facility is as follows:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> Quarter ending\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maximum leverage ratio permitted\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> June 30, 2020 up to and including June 30, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> September 30, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2021 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMoreover, the Amendment modified the range of variable interest rates that the Credit Facility may bear to be a range from LIBOR plus 1.500% to LIBOR plus 2.875% and included the addition of a LIBOR floor of 0.50%. The Amendment also reduced the aggregate borrowing commitment under the Credit Facility to $225 million and the amount by which we may elect to increase the facility size, known as the accordion\u201d feature, to $50 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Interest payment terms are variable depending upon the specific type of borrowing under this facility.\nAny outstanding balance under the Credit Facility is due on maturity on June 19, 2023. Our available capacity at any point in time is reduced by outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit which totaled $12.9 million, resulting in an available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility of $101.1 million, at December 31, 2020. In addition to indebtedness under the Credit Facility, we had $6.1 million of outstanding letters of credit and performance guarantees and bonds from other sources as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Credit Facility remains unsecured, and contains customary representations, warranties, terms and conditions for similar types of facilities. The terms of the Credit Facility and 2011 Senior Notes require us to meet certain covenants, including, but not limited to, an interest coverage ratio (calculated as consolidated EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage ratio (calculated as consolidated net indebtedness divided by consolidated EBITDA), where consolidated EBITDA (as defined in each agreement) and interest expense are calculated using the most recent four fiscal quarters. The Credit Facility and 2011 Senior Notes each include a cross-default provision, whereby a default under one agreement may trigger a default in the other agreement. The Credit Facility has the more restrictive covenants with a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and permits a maximum leverage ratio as described above. The Credit Facility allows non-cash charges such as impairment of assets, stock compensation and other non-cash charges to be added back in the calculation of consolidated EBITDA. The terms of our Credit Facility also allow us to negotiate in good faith to amend any ratio or requirement to preserve the original intent of the agreement if any change in accounting principles would affect the computation of any financial ratio or covenant of the Credit Facility. In accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility, our leverage ratio is 2.82, and our interest coverage ratio is 6.09, each for the period ended December 31, 2020. We believe that we are in compliance with all covenants contained in our Credit Facility and 2011 Senior Notes. Our parent, Core Laboratories N.V., together with certain of our material, wholly-owned subsidiaries are guarantors or co-borrowers under the Credit Facility and 2011 Senior Notes.\nWe entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $50 million to hedge changes in the variable rate interest expense on $50 million of our existing or replacement LIBOR-priced debt. Under the first swap agreement of $25 million, we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 2.50% through August 29, 2024. In February 2020, we entered into the second swap agreement of $25 million, under which we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 1.3% through February 28, 2025. Each swap is measured at fair value and recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability. They are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments and are highly effective. Unrealized losses are deferred to shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in income as an increase or decrease to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense On October 16, 2020, we, along with Core Laboratories (U.S.) Interests Holdings, Inc. as issuer, entered into the 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement. The 2020 Senior Notes were issued and funded on January 12, 2021. The Company used the $60 million in proceeds from issuing the 2020 Senior Notes to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. Series A of the 2020 Senior Notes consists of $45 million in aggregate principal amount that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.09% and are due in full on January 12, 2026. Series B of the 2020 Senior Notes consists of $15 million in aggregate principal amount that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.38% and are due in full on January 12, 2028. Interest on each series of the 2020 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on June 30 and December 30, commencing on June 30, 2021.\nThe terms of the 2020 Senior Notes require us to meet certain covenants, including, but not limited to, an interest coverage ratio (calculated as consolidated EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage ratio (calculated as consolidated net indebtedness divided by consolidated EBITDA), where consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement) and interest expense are calculated using the most recent four fiscal quarters; and a priority indebtedness ratio (calculated as Priority Indebtedness divided by Consolidated Total Assets (as defined in the 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement.) The financial covenants for the 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement are aligned with the Credit Facility and the associated 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement also allows renegotiation of the ratios in consideration of changes in accounting principles. We along with certain of our material, wholly-owned subsidiaries, are guarantors or co-borrowers under the 2020 Senior Notes.\nOn December 17, 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC for the issuance and sale of up to $60.0 million of our common shares. Under terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the sales of our common shares may be made by any method deemed to be an at-the-market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company elects when to issue a placement notice which may, among other sales parameters, specify the number of shares to be sold, the minimum price per share to be accepted, the daily volume of shares that may be sold and the range of dates when shares may be sold. There have been no sales under the agreement as of December 31, 2020, or for the time period from January 1, 2021 through February 5, 2021.\nIn addition to our repayment commitments under our Credit Facility and our 2011 Senior Notes, we have non-cancellable operating lease arrangements under which we lease office and lab space, machinery, equipment and vehicles.\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations under these arrangements (in thousands):\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 261,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 186,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pension (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 329,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 204,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) Not included in the above balances are anticipated cash payments for interest of $6.1 million a year for 2020-2021 and cash\npayments for interest of $3.1 million a year for 2022-2023 for a total of $18.4 million.

Not included in the table above are uncertain tax positions of $6.3 million that we have accrued for at December 31, 2020, as the amounts and timing of payment, if any, are uncertain. See Note 10 - Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of this amount.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had tax net operating loss carry-forwards in various jurisdictions of $62.3 million. Although we cannot be certain that these operating loss carry-forwards will be utilized, we anticipate that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to allow us to fully utilize the carry-forwards that are not subject to a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020. If unused, those carry-forwards which are subject to expiration may expire during the years 2021-2030. During 2020, we have no net operating loss carry-forwards, which carried a full valuation allowance, that expired unused.\nWe expect our investment in capital expenditures to track client demand for our services and products. Given the uncertain trend in industry activity levels, we have not determined, at this time, the level of investment that will be made in 2021. We will, however, continue to invest to fund the purchase of instrumentation, tools and equipment along with expenditures to replace obsolete or worn-out instrumentation, tools and equipment, to consolidate certain facilities to gain operational efficiencies, and to increase our presence where requested by our clients.\nOutlook\nThe events occurring during 2020 associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and government mandated business shut-downs around the world, home sheltering and social distancing policies have caused a significant decline in the demand for crude oil and associated products. The significant decline in demand has resulted in a significant decline in the price of crude oil, which has also resulted in a high degree of uncertainty about future demand and the future price for crude oil as long as the virus concerns persist. U.S. onshore drilling and completion activity have experienced the most significant impact, as the rig count and completion of wells have declined significantly during 2020 from previous year levels. International activity has also been impacted by disruption to our clients' operations and a significant decline in the international rig count. Additionally, our clients experienced disruptions from a record number of named tropical weather systems in the Gulf of Mexico during 2020. Although physical damage to Core Lab's facilities was minor; our clients experienced interruptions of business activity due to pre-storm preparations, offshore facility evacuations, local area flooding, power outages, and post-storm clean-up.\nWhile the full impact of COVID-19 on our business and the long-term worldwide impact still remains unknown, Core Laboratories has continued to operate as an essential business with timely delivery of products and services to our clients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued government restrictions, widespread growth in infections, travel restrictions, quarantines, and mandated site closures have led to disruptions in business workflows, which are expected to continue into 2021. These disruptions have primarily been associated with operational workflows stemming from travel, product delivery and installation, as well as suspensions and delays in client projects. We have not experienced any significant disruptions in our supply chain, and do not anticipate significant disruption in our supply chain. We also maintained and refreshed our continuity plan across our global organization to protect the health of employees while servicing clients.\nAs part of our long-term growth strategy, we continue our efforts to expand our market presence by opening or expanding facilities in strategic areas and realizing synergies within our business lines subject to client demand and market conditions. We\nbelieve our market presence provides us a unique opportunity to service clients who have global operations whether they are international oil companies, national oil companies, or independent oil companies.\nOur major clients continue to focus on capital management, return on invested capital ( ROIC\u201d), free cash flow, and returning capital back to their shareholders, as opposed to a heavier focus on growing production. The companies adopting value versus volume metrics tend to be the more technologically sophisticated operators and form the foundation of Core Lab's worldwide client base. Considering a longer-term strategy, we expect to be well positioned as our clients continue their focus on employing higher technological solutions in their efforts to optimize production and estimated ultimate recovery (\"EUR\") in the most cost efficient, environmentally responsible, manner. We believe operators will continue to manage their capital spending within reduced budgets and maintain their focus on strengthening their balance sheets and generating positive free cash flow.\nInternational field development spending was impacted by reduced operating budgets in response to declines in demand tied to COVID-19. Reservoir Description continues to work with clients and discuss the progression of longer-term international projects. Longer-term international and offshore projects are expected to continue and are not as susceptible or at-risk due to shorter-term volatility in crude oil commodity price. International and offshore activity are expected to gradually improve as the pandemic abates, but the timing of this improvement remains unclear. Additionally, the reservoir fluids analysis that is performed on projects associated with current producing fields, continues to be critical and will be less affected by lower commodity prices for crude oil. The adverse impact from COVID-19 and the depression of crude-oil prices has resulted in increased uncertainty associated with the activity levels and revenue opportunities from these international and offshore projects, however most of the larger projects, especially the projects that have already been commissioned and are in development, are focused on a longer term forecast versus a short to mid-term assessment of the crude oil commodity prices.\nU.S. onshore actively levels were most significantly impacted and reached historically low levels by mid-2020. However, U.S. onshore activity levels began to recover during the second half of the year, although not to the same levels preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. Assuming the situation with the COVID-19 virus improves across the globe and crude oil commodity prices remain at current levels or improve, we believe the U.S. onshore activity will gradually improve during 2021.\nIn response to market conditions, Core Lab's Supervisory Board approved a plan to reduce the Company's quarterly dividends to $0.01 per share beginning with the second quarter of 2020 and to focus excess free cash flows towards the reduction of debt. In March 2020, the Company implemented cost reduction initiatives and expanded these initiatives in June 2020, which included: (i) corporate and operating cost reductions; (ii) annual capital expenditures reduced to approximately $12 million, and (iii) eliminating all non-essential costs. The corporate and operating cost reductions included reductions in workforce and reduction of senior executive and employee compensation. Specifically, the Company has reduced senior executives' annual base salary by 20% for the foreseeable future. Although activities have declined and remained low in second half of 2020 due to the factors discussed above, this decline has been partially offset by the effectiveness of the Company's cost control initiatives. Lastly, the net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes, issued on January 12, 2021, were used exclusively to reduce outstanding debt and increase liquidity under the Company's Credit Facility as we work towards our long-term strategy of reducing debt.\nCore Lab believes these immediate actions, as well as continued assessment of market conditions, will allow Core Lab, as it has for over 83 years, to navigate through these challenging times. Core Lab remains focused on preserving the quality of service for its clients and producing returns for its shareholders.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and determine the adequacy of our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. By nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it is highly subjective and if changes in the estimate under different assumptions would result in a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The following transaction types require significant judgment and, therefore, are considered critical accounting policies as of December 31, 2020.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense includes income taxes of the Netherlands, the U.S. and other foreign countries as well as local, state and provincial income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the asset is expected to be recovered or the liability is expected to be settled. We estimate the likelihood of the recoverability of our\ndeferred tax assets (particularly, net operating loss carry-forwards). Any valuation allowance recorded is based on estimates and assumptions of taxable income into the future and a determination is made of the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized. Valuation allowances of our net deferred tax assets aggregated to $6.3 million and $6.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and our effective tax rate may increase which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We have not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that we consider to be indefinitely reinvested. Should we make a distribution of the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries, we may be required to record additional taxes. We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax return. We also recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nLong-Lived Assets, Intangibles and Goodwill\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. They are depreciated using the straight-line method based on their individual estimated useful lives, except for leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the remaining lease term, if shorter. We estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our assets based on historical data of similar assets. When long-lived assets are sold or retired, the remaining costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income. These capitalized long-lived assets could become impaired if our operating plans or business environment changes.\nIntangible assets, including patents, trademarks and technology, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangibles with determinable lives are amortized using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of the intangible. Intangibles with indeterminable lives, which consist primarily of corporate trade names, are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment is possible. We recorded an impairment charge of $8.2 million for certain intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2020. We did not record any material impairment charges relating to intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nWe review our long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible and right-of-use assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recovered over their remaining service lives. Indicators of possible impairment may include significant declines in activity levels in regions where specific assets or groups of assets are located, extended periods of idle use, declining revenue or cash flow or overall changes in general market conditions.\nWhenever possible impairment is indicated, we compare the carrying value of the assets to the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from use, plus salvage value, less the costs of the subsequent disposition of the assets. If impairment is still indicated, we compare the fair value of the assets to the carrying amount, and recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. We did not record any material impairment charges relating to our long-lived assets held for use during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nWe record goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. We test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment.\nWe evaluated our goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units, which are our reportable segments, to their net carrying value as of the balance sheet date. We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted future cash flow analysis. Estimated future cash flows were based on the Company's best estimate of future performance. Our impairment analysis is both qualitative and quantitative, and includes subjective estimates based on assumptions regarding future revenue growth rates, discount rate and expected margins. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value determined, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We recorded an impairment charge of $114.0 million for goodwill of one of our reporting units during the year ended December 31, 2020. We did not record impairment charges relating to our goodwill or our indefinite-lived intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have two stock-based compensation plans, as described in further detail in Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate the probability that certain of our stock-based plans will meet targets established within the respective agreements and result in the vesting of such awards. For new awards issued and awards modified, repurchased or canceled, the compensation expense is equal to the fair value of the award at the date of the grant and is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for those awards over the requisite service period of the\naward. The fair value is determined by calculating the share price on the date of grant less the discounted value of the expected dividends to be paid over the vesting period.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements such as securitization agreements, liquidity trust vehicles or special purpose entities. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K and the documents incorporated in this Form 10-K by reference contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These \"forward-looking statements\" are based on an analysis of currently available competitive, financial and economic data and our operating plans. They are inherently uncertain and investors should recognize that events and actual results could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations. By way of illustration, when used in this document, words such as \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"project\", \"will\", \"should\", \"could\", \"may\", \"predict\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. You are cautioned that actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us or our management, are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us and the industry in which we operate, including, among other things:\n \u2022 our ability to continue to develop or acquire new and useful technology; \n \u2022 the realization of anticipated synergies from acquired businesses and future acquisitions; \n \u2022 our dependence on one industry, oil and gas, and the impact of commodity prices on the expenditure levels of our clients; \n \u2022 competition in the markets we serve; \n \u2022 the risks and uncertainties attendant to adverse industry, political, economic and financial market conditions, including stock prices, government regulations, interest rates and credit availability; \n \u2022 unsettled political conditions, war, civil unrest, currency controls and governmental actions in the numerous countries in which we operate; \n \u2022 changes in the price of oil and natural gas; \n \u2022 major outbreak of global pandemic and restricting mobilization of field personnel; \n \u2022 weather and seasonal factors; \n \u2022 integration of acquired businesses; and \n \u2022 the effects of industry consolidation. \nOur businesses depend, to a large degree, on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Therefore, a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil, which could have a material impact on exploration, development and production activities, could also materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe above description of risks and uncertainties is by no means all-inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider. For a more detailed description of risk factors, please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in this Form 10-K and our reports and registration statements filed from time to time with the SEC.\nAll forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are based on information available to us on the date of this Form 10-K. We do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements that we may make in this Form 10-K or other documents, reports, filings or press releases, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPronouncements Adopted in 2019\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 (\"Leases\"), which introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The new standard establishes a\nright-of-use (\"ROU\") model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11 (\"Targeted Improvements to Leases\"), which provides companies with an additional transition method that allows the effects of the adoption of the new standard to be recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. We elected this optional transition method for adoption. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2019 had a material impact to our Consolidated Balance Sheet, but not to our Consolidated Statement of Operations or Cash Flows. The most significant impact was the recognition of $77.5 million of ROU assets and liabilities for operating leases, while our accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged.\nPronouncements Adopted in 2020\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 (\"Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\") which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2020, and there has been no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or on our accounting policies and processes.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 ( Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\u201d) which eliminates a step in computing the implied fair value of goodwill with a new methodology of an entity performing an annual goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2020. The new methodology was applied for the interim goodwill impairment analysis performed upon the triggering event of the COVID-19 pandemic during the three month period ended March 31, 2020, and it did not change the conclusion that goodwill had been impaired. There has been no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or on our accounting policies and processes as a result of adopting this updated accounting standard.", "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCore Laboratories N.V. is a Netherlands limited liability company. We were established in 1936 and are one of the world's leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description and production enhancement services and products to the oil and gas industry, primarily through client relationships with many of the world's major, national and independent oil companies.\nWe operate our business in two reporting segments. These complementary segments provide different services and products and utilize different technologies for evaluating and improving reservoir performance and increasing oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields:\n \u2022 Reservoir Description: Encompasses the characterization of petroleum reservoir rock and reservoir fluids samples to increase production and improve recovery of crude oil and natural gas from our clients' reservoirs. We provide laboratory-based analytical and field services to characterize properties of crude oil and crude oil-derived products to the oil and gas industry. We also provide proprietary and joint industry studies based on these types of analyses and manufacture associated laboratory equipment. \n \u2022 Production Enhancement: Includes services and manufactured products relating to reservoir well completions, perforations, stimulation and production. We provide integrated diagnostic services to evaluate and monitor the effectiveness of well completions and to develop solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery projects. \nGeneral Overview\nWe provide services as well as design and produce products which enable our clients to evaluate and improve reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields. These services and products are generally in higher demand when our clients are investing capital in their field development programs that are designed to increase productivity from existing fields or when exploring for appraising and developing new fields. Our clients' investment in capital expenditure programs tends to correlate over the longer term to oil and natural gas commodity prices. During periods of higher, stable prices, our clients generally invest more in capital expenditures and, during periods of lower or volatile commodity prices, they tend to invest less. Consequently, the level of capital expenditures by our clients impacts the demand for our services and products.\nThe following table summarizes the annual average and year-end worldwide and U.S. rig counts for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, as well as the annual average and year-end spot price of a barrel of WTI crude, Europe Brent crude and an MMBtu of natural gas:\n\nThe prices for both WTI and Brent crude oil declined from 2018 to 2019 and decreased significantly at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and throughout the second quarter of 2020, due to the outbreak of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated government mandated shut-downs around the world, home sheltering and social distancing policies, have caused a significant decline in the demand for crude oil and associated products. Crude-oil prices improved during the second half of 2020, and became more stable during the fourth quarter of the year. The end result was the average price for crude oil in 2020 was approximately 33% lower than the average price for 2019. In general, activities associated with the exploration of oil and\ngas in the U.S. onshore market are more sensitive to changes in the crude-oil commodity prices, as opposed to larger international and offshore projects which take multiple years to plan and develop, and once announced and started, will continue through completion, despite changes in the current price of crude oil. Crude-oil prices in 2018 and 2019 remained at levels sufficient to support more stable levels in U.S. onshore activities associated with both the exploration and production of crude oil. Additionally, during the 2018 - 2019 time period, public announcements of investments in larger international and offshore projects increased and activity levels on these larger international and offshore projects began to improve in 2018 and continued to improve into 2019. However, in early 2020, the impact of COVID-19 to global economies caused a significant and sharp decline in demand for crude oil, which resulted in a significant and sharp decrease in the price of crude oil. Activity levels in the U.S. onshore market also responded immediately and decreased significantly to historically low levels, which bottomed in the summer of 2020, but showed some recovery in the second half of the year as global demand partially recovered, global production of crude oil was reduced and crude oil prices showed some recovery. Information published by the EIA, shows that the inventory of wells drilled but uncompleted (a DUC\u201d well) was 7,543 as of December 31, 2018, increasing to a peak in July 2019 at approximately 8,533, however, it subsequently declined to 7,782 and 7,592 at end of 2019 and 2020, respectively. This data indicates that during the period of higher activity in 2018, operators were drilling wells but not completing them as the DUC inventory grew. However, as activity levels began to fall in the second half of 2019, and a sharper decline in 2020, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, the operators began to drill fewer new wells, but were completing some of the wells that had been previously drilled, which is reflected in the lower DUC inventory at December 2019 and 2020.\nIn North America, the land-based rig count decreased over 11% from 2018 to 2019. There was subsequently a significant decline of 51% in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19. Consequently, the magnitude of decline in demand for both services and product sales to this market responded in line with the changes over this time period. The increase in activities on development projects and producing fields in the U.S. unconventional reservoirs during 2018 showed a decline when the commodity price weakened and activity levels decreased in 2019. In the U.S., the lower commodity prices led to a 54% decrease in the annual average land-based rig count and a decline in U.S. based activities in 2020.\nOutside of North America, activities associated with the exploration for and production of oil were showing modest improvement in 2018 and 2019 until the global pandemic emerged in early 2020. The decrease in global demand for crude oil caused by the global pandemic also had a significant impact on exploration and production activities in the international markets as the number of active rigs outside the United States decreased almost 39% during 2020. Long-term international and offshore projects which are commonly announced through Final Investment Decisions and subsequently initiated are not susceptible or at-risk to delay or suspension due to short-term volatility in crude-oil commodity price, however the extreme negative market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to reduce the spread of the virus have negatively impacted the entire energy market in 2020.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nWe evaluate our operating results by analyzing revenue, operating income and operating income margin (defined as operating income divided by total revenue). Since we have a relatively fixed cost structure, decreases in revenue generally translate into lower operating income results. Results for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are summarized in the following chart:\nResults of operations as a percentage of applicable revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows (in thousands, except for per share information):\n\nServices Revenue\nServices revenue, which is primarily tied to activities associated with the exploration and production of oil and gas outside the U.S., decreased to $376.4 million in 2020 from $474.2 million in 2019 and $486.8 million in 2018. In 2020, the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and government mandated shut-down around the world, home sheltering and social distancing policies caused a sharp decline in the demand for crude-oil and associated products. The average crude-oil price in 2020 was 33% lower than the average price of 2019. This resulted in decreased and disrupted activity by our clients and disruptions to our revenue generating operational activities leading to a sharp decrease in service revenue in both the U.S. and international markets during most of 2020. Crude-oil prices weakened in 2019 with the average price of 10% lower than the average price in 2018. This resulted in decreased activity by our clients leading to lower service revenue in the North America onshore market during 2019 compared to 2018. However, improvement in the level of work performed for offshore and international exploration and production projects partially offset some of the decline in the U.S. market.\nWe continue to focus on large-scale core analyses and reservoir fluids characterization studies in the Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, along with Guyana, Surinam, Malaysia and other international locations such as offshore South America, Australia, and the Middle East, including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and other countries. Analysis of crude oil and crude oil-derived products also occurs in every major producing region of the world.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nProduct sales revenue, which is primarily tied to the completion of onshore wells in North America, was $110.8 million in 2020, a decrease from $194.0 million and $214 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Rig count is one indicator of activity levels associated with the exploration and production of oil and gas. The rig count for North America significantly decreased in excess of 50% from 2019 to 2020 and decreased from 2018 to 2019 by 12%. Our products sales revenue decreased 43% from 2019 to 2020, and decreased 9% from 2018 to 2019, primarily due to our differentiated well completion products.\nCost of Services, excluding depreciation\nCost of services decreased to $279.3 million in 2020 compared to $345.6 million and $343.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a percentage of services revenue, cost of services increased to 74% in 2020 from 73% and 71% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in cost of services in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to a significant decline in client activity levels and employee compensation and related charges associated with cost reduction initiatives implemented by the Company during the year. A slight increase in cost of services in 2019 from 2018, was primarily due to employee compensation and related charges. Cost of services expressed as a percentage of services revenue, is primarily reflective of how our cost structure is absorbed by revenue, and the timing of implementation of cost reduction initiatives executed by the Company in responding to the adverse changes in client activity levels.\nCost of Product Sales, excluding depreciation\nCost of product sales of $95.5 million in 2020 decreased from $150.0 million and $153.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Given product sales are primarily associated with our Production Enhancement segment and the North American market, cost of sales is impacted by decreased activities associated with clients operating in these segments and geographic markets. As a percentage of product sales revenue, cost of sales increased to 86% for 2020 from 77% and 72% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cost of product sales expressed as a percentage of product sales revenue is primarily reflective of how our fixed costs are absorbed by revenue. Due to the significant decrease in product sales revenue in 2020, fixed costs increased as a percentage of total cost of product sales and product sales revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense, excluding depreciation\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses include corporate management and centralized administrative services that benefit our operations. G&A expenses were $34.0 million in 2020 compared to $48.0 million and $62.9 million during 2019 and 2018, respectively. The variances are primarily due to changes in compensation expense during those periods, including accelerated stock compensation expense of $6.7 million in 2020, $7.2 million in 2019 and $9.9 million in 2018 recorded for retirement eligible employees. During 2020, due to the significant adverse impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, certain performance metrics associated with long-term stock-based performance awards were not achieved, resulting in potential employee stock awards above the target level not vesting or being issued in 2020. However, the Company's Compensation Committee approved a modification to the methodology of measuring performance conditions associated with target level long-term employee stock-based compensation awards, which vested at target levels on December 31, 2020. As a result of the stock-based awards not vesting above the target levels and modifications to the performance measures, the value of the stock-based awards that did vest on December 31, 2020 were revalued, and $11.9 million of previously recognized stock compensation expense was reversed in 2020, out of which $11.3 million was recorded in G&A expenses and $0.6 million recorded in cost of sales. See Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense of $20.9 million in 2020 is down compared to $22.6 million and $23.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as a result of decreased capital expenditures.\nImpairments, inventory write-down and other charges\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting sharp decrease in the price of crude oil, which caused a sharp decrease in the consumption and demand for crude oil, led to a triggering event in March 2020. In response to the triggering event, the Company updated its analysis associated with future cash flows and the valuation of assets and potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Our updated analysis resulted in the Company recording a charge of $114.0 million for impairment of goodwill and $8.2 million for impairments to\nintangible assets in March 2020 in our Production Enhancement segment. In addition, we recorded a charge of $10.4 million associated with inventory obsolescence and a valuation write-down related to our Production Enhancement segment.\nThere were no other triggering events during the year, and based on our annual assessment for the year ended December 31, 2020, we determined there was no further impairment for any of our reporting units or asset groups.\nOther (Income) Expense, net\nThe components of Other (income) expense, net were as follows (in thousands):\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\n\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $14.4 million in 2020 compared to $14.7 million and $13.3 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, the Company reduced outstanding debt under its Credit Facility by $46.0 million, however additional interest expense was incurred to modify the revolving credit agreement in 2020 which also includes higher interest rate spreads when compared to the previous terms under revolving credit agreement. The increase in interest expense in 2019 when compared to 2018 is primarily due to increased average borrowing under our Credit Facility in 2019 compared to 2018.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective tax rate was (6.5)%, (15.0)%, and 24.2% for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Income tax expense of $5.9 million in 2020 increased by $18.1 million compared to a $12.3 million benefit in 2019 primarily due to a large impairment charge of $122.2 million in the first quarter of 2020, of which a substantial portion was not deductible for tax purposes. A $5.5 million benefit was recognized associated with this impairment. In contrast, a benefit of $60.7 million was recognized in 2019 related to corporate restructuring which was partially offset by a charge of $26.7 million related to unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that we no longer consider to be indefinitely reinvested.\nSee Note 10 - Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of income tax expense.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn a continuing effort to streamline our business and align our business strategy for further integration of services and products, the Company committed to divest our full range of permanent downhole monitoring systems and related services, which had been part of our Production Enhancement segment. We entered into the definitive purchase agreement on June 7, 2019 for the divestiture of this business, and during the year ended December 31, 2020, we concluded final adjustments to the purchase agreement of the sold business.\nSee Note 20 - Discontinued Operations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSegment Analysis\nThe following charts and tables summarize the annual revenue and operating results for our two complementary business segments.\nSegment Revenue\nSegment Revenue\n\nSegment Operating Income (Loss)\n\nSegment Operating Income (Loss) Margins (1)\n\nReservoir Description\nRevenue for our Reservoir Description segment decreased to $355.0 million in 2020 compared to $420.9 million and $413.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Reservoir Description's operations are heavily exposed to international and offshore project activity levels, with approximately 80% of its revenue sourced outside the U.S. In 2019, our client's activity levels in the international markets had modestly increased when compared to 2018. However, in early 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic began, global economies were locked down in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus and demand for crude oil decreased sharply. The sharp decrease in demand and challenges to remain operational during the global pandemic caused many adverse impacts to the energy industry, our clients and the Company. Revenue was also adversely impacted in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to focus on large-scale core analyses and reservoir fluids characterization studies in the Eagle Ford, the Permian Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, along with Guyana, Suriname, Malaysia and other international locations such as offshore South America, Australia, and the Middle East, including Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and other countries. Analysis of crude oil and crude oil-derived products also occurs in every major producing region of the world.\nOperating income of $55.0 million remained relatively flat in 2020 compared to $55.1 million in 2019 and from $54.8 million in 2018. Although there was a significant decline in our client's activity levels and the Company's revenue in 2020 caused by the factors indicated above, operating income was less affected as the Company implemented significant cost reductions in 2020, and as a result of reversing previously recognized stock compensation expense for certain employees' PSAP awards of $7.6 million. See Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. The increased operating income in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to improved activity levels associated with large projects in international markets. However, the improved operating income for 2019 was partially offset by additional expenses associated with employee severance and other cost reduction initiatives of $4.0 million. Included in both 2019 and 2018 are additional stock compensation expense of $4.7 million in 2019 for retirement eligible employees compared to $6.3 million in 2018. See Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail. Operating margins improved to 15.5% in 2020 compared to 13.1% and 13.3% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Operating margins in 2020 improved due to a significant decrease in costs of services as a result of cost reduction initiatives implemented and the reduction of stock-based compensation expense described above.\nProduction Enhancement\nRevenue for our Production Enhancement segment of $132.2 million in 2020 decreased compared to $247.3 million and $287.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, a sharp decrease of drilling and well completion activities in the U.S. onshore market was primarily due to impact of the global pandemic as described above. The U.S. rig count decreased in excess of 50% during 2020 as compared to 2019 and decreased 12% in 2019 when compared to 2018. Our clients continue to seek technological solutions for increasing daily production and estimated ultimate recoveries from their reservoirs and we continue to benefit from our clients' acceptance of new services and products which were led by the HERO\u00ae PerFRAC, GoGunTM, FLOWPROFILER EDSTM and ReFRAC technologies.\nOur Production Enhancement segment had operating loss of $133.4 million in 2020 compared to operating income of $38.4 million and $63.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The operating loss in 2020 was primarily the result of non-cash charges of $122.2 million for impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets, a charge in excess of $10.0 million for inventory valuation write-down and obsolescence, and severance expense of $2.6 million recorded during the year. This operating loss was partially offset by the benefit of cost reduction initiatives implemented during 2020 and reversal of previously recognized stock compensation expense associated with certain employees' long term stock-based performance awards of $3.6 million. See Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The decrease in operating income from 2018 to 2019, is primarily due to a decrease in exploration and production activity in the U.S. onshore market over this time period.\nOperating margin was negative 101% in 2020, which was the result of a significant decrease in revenue combined with the goodwill impairment, asset impairments and inventory charges recorded as described above. Operating margin for 2020 were breakeven, when excluding the non-cash charges associated with the goodwill impairment, asset impairment and inventory write down. Operating margins in 2019 and 2018 were 15.5% and 21.9%, respectively, and decreased primarily due to lower revenue in 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nWe have historically financed our activities through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, bank credit facilities, equity financing and the issuance of debt. Cash flows from operating activities provide the primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and our dividend and share repurchase programs. We believe our future cash flows from\noperations, supplemented by our borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and the ability to issue additional equity and debt, should be sufficient to fund our debt requirements, capital expenditures, working capital, dividend payments and future acquisitions. The Company will continue to monitor and evaluate the availability of debt and equity markets.\nIn response to market conditions, Core Lab's Supervisory Board approved a plan to reduce the Company's quarterly dividends to $0.01 per share beginning with the second quarter of 2020 and to focus excess free cash flow on debt reduction. In March 2020, the Company implemented cost reduction initiatives and expanded these initiatives in June 2020, which included: (i) corporate and operating cost reductions; (ii) annual capital expenditures reduced to approximately $12 million, and (iii) eliminating all non-essential costs. The corporate and operating cost reductions included reductions in workforce and reduction of senior executive and employee compensation. Specifically, the Company has reduced senior executives' annual base salary by 20% for the foreseeable future. On June 22, 2020, also in response to market conditions, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (the Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Facility. The Amendment provides, among other things, an increase to the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the Credit Facility for certain periods. See Note 9 - Long-Term Debt, Net of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, on October 16, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement (the 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement\u201d) to issue $60 million in notes (the 2020 Senior Notes\u201d) in a private placement, which were issued and funded at the closing on January 12, 2021. The Company used the net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes to reduce outstanding debt under the Company's Credit Facility, which increased the available borrowing capacity and liquidity for Core Lab. We intend to maintain sufficient borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility to both retire the maturing debt obligations in September 2021, and provide additional liquidity, should the company require it for other purposes. See Note 9 - Long-Term Debt, Net of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAs we are a Netherlands holding company, we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries. Our cash availability is largely dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to us and on the terms and conditions of our existing and future credit arrangements. There are no restrictions preventing any of our subsidiaries from repatriating earnings, and there are no restrictions or income taxes associated with distributing cash to the parent company through loans or advances. As of December 31, 2020, $8.8 million of our $13.8 million of cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries, including the U.S.\nOur financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\" or \"GAAP\"). We utilize the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow to evaluate our cash flows and results of operations. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure) less cash paid for capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding the cash that was available in the period that was in excess of our needs to fund our capital expenditures and operating activities. Free cash flow is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation nor construed as an alternative to operating profit, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for distribution because we may have other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. Moreover, since free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP and thus is susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations, free cash flow, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The following table reconciles this non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP (in thousands):\n\nThe decrease in free cash flow in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily attributable to a decrease in activity levels and cash generated from operations, and cash payments for employee post-retirement benefits funded by previously purchased company-owned life insurance policies, offset by a decrease in working capital and capital spending. The decrease in free cash flow in 2019 compared to 2018 was also due to lower operational activity levels in 2019, but also an increase in working capital and a slight increase in capital expenditures in 2019.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes cash flows (in thousands):\n\nThe decreases in cash provided by operating activities in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to significant decreases in activity levels and operating income due to the impact of the COVID-19 and cash payments for employee post-retirement benefits funded by previously purchased company-owned life insurance policies, partially offset by benefits from cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2020 and a decrease in working capital. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to decreased operating income as the activity levels for the U.S. onshore oil and gas market declined.\nCash provided by investing activities was $7.9 million in 2020 compared to cash used in investing activities of $5.7 million in 2019. The increase in cash flows from investing activities in 2020 was primarily due to lower capital expenditures in 2020 of $11.9 million, a decrease of $10.4 million when compared to 2019 capital expenditures, and cash received from company-owned life insurance policies of $20.4 million in 2020, compared to proceeds from the divesture of two businesses totaling $17.8 million in 2019. Cash used in investing activities in 2019 decreased $65.0 million compared to 2018, as 2018 included an acquisition, net of cash, for $47.3 million, and 2019 includes proceeds from the divestiture of two businesses as indicated above.\nCash used in financing activities in 2020 decreased $22.9 million compared to 2019. In 2020, dividends paid were reduced by $85.1 million, of which $46 million were used to repay of debt borrowings, which compares to $15 million provided by proceeds from debt borrowings in 2019. Cash used in financing activities in 2019 increased $43.4 million compared to 2018. During 2019, we used $3.3 million to repurchase our common shares, $97.6 million to pay dividends, and increased our debt balance by $15 million. During 2018, we used $7.5 million to repurchase our common shares, $97.3 million to pay dividends, and increased our debt balance by $64 million, primarily to fund the acquisition of a business in 2018 for $48.9 million.\nDuring 2020, we repurchased 100,929 shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of $2.8 million, or an average price of $27.68 per share. The repurchase of shares in the open market is at the discretion of management pursuant to shareholder authorization. We regard these treasury shares as a temporary investment which may be used to fund long-term employee stock-based compensation plans or to finance future acquisitions. Under Dutch law and subject to certain Dutch statutory provisions and shareholder approval, we can hold a maximum of 50% of our issued shares in treasury. We currently have shareholder approval to hold 10% of our issued share capital in treasury. On May 20, 2020 at our annual shareholders meeting, our shareholders authorized the extension of our share repurchase program until November 20, 2021 to purchase up to 10% of our issued share capital. We believe this share repurchase program has been beneficial to our shareholders. Our share price has increased from $4.03 per share in 2002, when we began to repurchase shares, to $26.51 per share on December 31, 2020, an increase of 558%.\nCredit Facility and Available Future Liquidity\nIn 2011, we issued two series of senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $150 million (\"2011 Senior Notes\") in a private placement transaction. Series A consists of $75 million in aggregate principal amount of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.01% and are due in full on September 30, 2021. Series B consists of $75 million in aggregate principal amount of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.11% and are due in full on September 30, 2023. Interest on each series of the 2011 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on March 30 and September 30.\nOn June 22, 2020, we entered into the Amendment to the Credit Facility. The Amendment increases the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the Credit Facility for certain periods. Pursuant to the terms of the Amendment, the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the Credit Facility is as follows:\n\nMoreover, the Amendment modified the range of variable interest rates that the Credit Facility may bear to be a range from LIBOR plus 1.500% to LIBOR plus 2.875% and included the addition of a LIBOR floor of 0.50%. The Amendment also reduced the aggregate borrowing commitment under the Credit Facility to $225 million and the amount by which we may elect to increase the facility size, known as the accordion\u201d feature, to $50 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Interest payment terms are variable depending upon the specific type of borrowing under this facility.\nAny outstanding balance under the Credit Facility is due on maturity on June 19, 2023. Our available capacity at any point in time is reduced by outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit which totaled $12.9 million, resulting in an available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility of $101.1 million, at December 31, 2020. In addition to indebtedness under the Credit Facility, we had $6.1 million of outstanding letters of credit and performance guarantees and bonds from other sources as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Credit Facility remains unsecured, and contains customary representations, warranties, terms and conditions for similar types of facilities. The terms of the Credit Facility and 2011 Senior Notes require us to meet certain covenants, including, but not limited to, an interest coverage ratio (calculated as consolidated EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage ratio (calculated as consolidated net indebtedness divided by consolidated EBITDA), where consolidated EBITDA (as defined in each agreement) and interest expense are calculated using the most recent four fiscal quarters. The Credit Facility and 2011 Senior Notes each include a cross-default provision, whereby a default under one agreement may trigger a default in the other agreement. The Credit Facility has the more restrictive covenants with a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 and permits a maximum leverage ratio as described above. The Credit Facility allows non-cash charges such as impairment of assets, stock compensation and other non-cash charges to be added back in the calculation of consolidated EBITDA. The terms of our Credit Facility also allow us to negotiate in good faith to amend any ratio or requirement to preserve the original intent of the agreement if any change in accounting principles would affect the computation of any financial ratio or covenant of the Credit Facility. In accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility, our leverage ratio is 2.82, and our interest coverage ratio is 6.09, each for the period ended December 31, 2020. We believe that we are in compliance with all covenants contained in our Credit Facility and 2011 Senior Notes. Our parent, Core Laboratories N.V., together with certain of our material, wholly-owned subsidiaries are guarantors or co-borrowers under the Credit Facility and 2011 Senior Notes.\nWe entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of $50 million to hedge changes in the variable rate interest expense on $50 million of our existing or replacement LIBOR-priced debt. Under the first swap agreement of $25 million, we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 2.50% through August 29, 2024. In February 2020, we entered into the second swap agreement of $25 million, under which we have fixed the LIBOR portion of the interest rate at 1.3% through February 28, 2025. Each swap is measured at fair value and recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability. They are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments and are highly effective. Unrealized losses are deferred to shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in income as an increase or decrease to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense On October 16, 2020, we, along with Core Laboratories (U.S.) Interests Holdings, Inc. as issuer, entered into the 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement. The 2020 Senior Notes were issued and funded on January 12, 2021. The Company used the $60 million in proceeds from issuing the 2020 Senior Notes to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. Series A of the 2020 Senior Notes consists of $45 million in aggregate principal amount that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.09% and are due in full on January 12, 2026. Series B of the 2020 Senior Notes consists of $15 million in aggregate principal amount that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.38% and are due in full on January 12, 2028. Interest on each series of the 2020 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on June 30 and December 30, commencing on June 30, 2021.\nThe terms of the 2020 Senior Notes require us to meet certain covenants, including, but not limited to, an interest coverage ratio (calculated as consolidated EBITDA divided by interest expense) and a leverage ratio (calculated as consolidated net indebtedness divided by consolidated EBITDA), where consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement) and interest expense are calculated using the most recent four fiscal quarters; and a priority indebtedness ratio (calculated as Priority Indebtedness divided by Consolidated Total Assets (as defined in the 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement.) The financial covenants for the 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement are aligned with the Credit Facility and the associated 2020 Notes Purchase Agreement also allows renegotiation of the ratios in consideration of changes in accounting principles. We along with certain of our material, wholly-owned subsidiaries, are guarantors or co-borrowers under the 2020 Senior Notes.\nOn December 17, 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Wells Fargo Securities, LLC for the issuance and sale of up to $60.0 million of our common shares. Under terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the sales of our common shares may be made by any method deemed to be an at-the-market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933. The Company elects when to issue a placement notice which may, among other sales parameters, specify the number of shares to be sold, the minimum price per share to be accepted, the daily volume of shares that may be sold and the range of dates when shares may be sold. There have been no sales under the agreement as of December 31, 2020, or for the time period from January 1, 2021 through February 5, 2021.\nIn addition to our repayment commitments under our Credit Facility and our 2011 Senior Notes, we have non-cancellable operating lease arrangements under which we lease office and lab space, machinery, equipment and vehicles.\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations under these arrangements (in thousands):\n\nWe have no significant purchase commitments or similar obligations outstanding at December 31, 2020. Not included in the table above are uncertain tax positions of $6.3 million that we have accrued for at December 31, 2020, as the amounts and timing of payment, if any, are uncertain. See Note 10 - Income Taxes of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail of this amount.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had tax net operating loss carry-forwards in various jurisdictions of $62.3 million. Although we cannot be certain that these operating loss carry-forwards will be utilized, we anticipate that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to allow us to fully utilize the carry-forwards that are not subject to a valuation allowance as of December 31, 2020. If unused, those carry-forwards which are subject to expiration may expire during the years 2021-2030. During 2020, we have no net operating loss carry-forwards, which carried a full valuation allowance, that expired unused.\nWe expect our investment in capital expenditures to track client demand for our services and products. Given the uncertain trend in industry activity levels, we have not determined, at this time, the level of investment that will be made in 2021. We will, however, continue to invest to fund the purchase of instrumentation, tools and equipment along with expenditures to replace obsolete or worn-out instrumentation, tools and equipment, to consolidate certain facilities to gain operational efficiencies, and to increase our presence where requested by our clients.\nOutlook\nThe events occurring during 2020 associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and government mandated business shut-downs around the world, home sheltering and social distancing policies have caused a significant decline in the demand for crude oil and associated products. The significant decline in demand has resulted in a significant decline in the price of crude oil, which has also resulted in a high degree of uncertainty about future demand and the future price for crude oil as long as the virus concerns persist. U.S. onshore drilling and completion activity have experienced the most significant impact, as the rig count and completion of wells have declined significantly during 2020 from previous year levels. International activity has also been impacted by disruption to our clients' operations and a significant decline in the international rig count. Additionally, our clients experienced disruptions from a record number of named tropical weather systems in the Gulf of Mexico during 2020. Although physical damage to Core Lab's facilities was minor; our clients experienced interruptions of business activity due to pre-storm preparations, offshore facility evacuations, local area flooding, power outages, and post-storm clean-up.\nWhile the full impact of COVID-19 on our business and the long-term worldwide impact still remains unknown, Core Laboratories has continued to operate as an essential business with timely delivery of products and services to our clients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued government restrictions, widespread growth in infections, travel restrictions, quarantines, and mandated site closures have led to disruptions in business workflows, which are expected to continue into 2021. These disruptions have primarily been associated with operational workflows stemming from travel, product delivery and installation, as well as suspensions and delays in client projects. We have not experienced any significant disruptions in our supply chain, and do not anticipate significant disruption in our supply chain. We also maintained and refreshed our continuity plan across our global organization to protect the health of employees while servicing clients.\nAs part of our long-term growth strategy, we continue our efforts to expand our market presence by opening or expanding facilities in strategic areas and realizing synergies within our business lines subject to client demand and market conditions. We\nbelieve our market presence provides us a unique opportunity to service clients who have global operations whether they are international oil companies, national oil companies, or independent oil companies.\nOur major clients continue to focus on capital management, return on invested capital ( ROIC\u201d), free cash flow, and returning capital back to their shareholders, as opposed to a heavier focus on growing production. The companies adopting value versus volume metrics tend to be the more technologically sophisticated operators and form the foundation of Core Lab's worldwide client base. Considering a longer-term strategy, we expect to be well positioned as our clients continue their focus on employing higher technological solutions in their efforts to optimize production and estimated ultimate recovery (\"EUR\") in the most cost efficient, environmentally responsible, manner. We believe operators will continue to manage their capital spending within reduced budgets and maintain their focus on strengthening their balance sheets and generating positive free cash flow.\nInternational field development spending was impacted by reduced operating budgets in response to declines in demand tied to COVID-19. Reservoir Description continues to work with clients and discuss the progression of longer-term international projects. Longer-term international and offshore projects are expected to continue and are not as susceptible or at-risk due to shorter-term volatility in crude oil commodity price. International and offshore activity are expected to gradually improve as the pandemic abates, but the timing of this improvement remains unclear. Additionally, the reservoir fluids analysis that is performed on projects associated with current producing fields, continues to be critical and will be less affected by lower commodity prices for crude oil. The adverse impact from COVID-19 and the depression of crude-oil prices has resulted in increased uncertainty associated with the activity levels and revenue opportunities from these international and offshore projects, however most of the larger projects, especially the projects that have already been commissioned and are in development, are focused on a longer term forecast versus a short to mid-term assessment of the crude oil commodity prices.\nU.S. onshore actively levels were most significantly impacted and reached historically low levels by mid-2020. However, U.S. onshore activity levels began to recover during the second half of the year, although not to the same levels preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. Assuming the situation with the COVID-19 virus improves across the globe and crude oil commodity prices remain at current levels or improve, we believe the U.S. onshore activity will gradually improve during 2021.\nIn response to market conditions, Core Lab's Supervisory Board approved a plan to reduce the Company's quarterly dividends to $0.01 per share beginning with the second quarter of 2020 and to focus excess free cash flows towards the reduction of debt. In March 2020, the Company implemented cost reduction initiatives and expanded these initiatives in June 2020, which included: (i) corporate and operating cost reductions; (ii) annual capital expenditures reduced to approximately $12 million, and (iii) eliminating all non-essential costs. The corporate and operating cost reductions included reductions in workforce and reduction of senior executive and employee compensation. Specifically, the Company has reduced senior executives' annual base salary by 20% for the foreseeable future. Although activities have declined and remained low in second half of 2020 due to the factors discussed above, this decline has been partially offset by the effectiveness of the Company's cost control initiatives. Lastly, the net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes, issued on January 12, 2021, were used exclusively to reduce outstanding debt and increase liquidity under the Company's Credit Facility as we work towards our long-term strategy of reducing debt.\nCore Lab believes these immediate actions, as well as continued assessment of market conditions, will allow Core Lab, as it has for over 83 years, to navigate through these challenging times. Core Lab remains focused on preserving the quality of service for its clients and producing returns for its shareholders.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and determine the adequacy of our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. By nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it is highly subjective and if changes in the estimate under different assumptions would result in a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The following transaction types require significant judgment and, therefore, are considered critical accounting policies as of December 31, 2020.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense includes income taxes of the Netherlands, the U.S. and other foreign countries as well as local, state and provincial income taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the asset is expected to be recovered or the liability is expected to be settled. We estimate the likelihood of the recoverability of our\ndeferred tax assets (particularly, net operating loss carry-forwards). Any valuation allowance recorded is based on estimates and assumptions of taxable income into the future and a determination is made of the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized. Valuation allowances of our net deferred tax assets aggregated to $6.3 million and $6.2 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and our effective tax rate may increase which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We have not provided for deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that we consider to be indefinitely reinvested. Should we make a distribution of the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries, we may be required to record additional taxes. We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our tax return. We also recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nLong-Lived Assets, Intangibles and Goodwill\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. They are depreciated using the straight-line method based on their individual estimated useful lives, except for leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the remaining lease term, if shorter. We estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our assets based on historical data of similar assets. When long-lived assets are sold or retired, the remaining costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income. These capitalized long-lived assets could become impaired if our operating plans or business environment changes.\nIntangible assets, including patents, trademarks and technology, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangibles with determinable lives are amortized using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of the intangible. Intangibles with indeterminable lives, which consist primarily of corporate trade names, are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment is possible. We recorded an impairment charge of $8.2 million for certain intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2020. We did not record any material impairment charges relating to intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nWe review our long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible and right-of-use assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recovered over their remaining service lives. Indicators of possible impairment may include significant declines in activity levels in regions where specific assets or groups of assets are located, extended periods of idle use, declining revenue or cash flow or overall changes in general market conditions.\nWhenever possible impairment is indicated, we compare the carrying value of the assets to the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from use, plus salvage value, less the costs of the subsequent disposition of the assets. If impairment is still indicated, we compare the fair value of the assets to the carrying amount, and recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. We did not record any material impairment charges relating to our long-lived assets held for use during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nWe record goodwill as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. We test goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment.\nWe evaluated our goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units, which are our reportable segments, to their net carrying value as of the balance sheet date. We estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted future cash flow analysis. Estimated future cash flows were based on the Company's best estimate of future performance. Our impairment analysis is both qualitative and quantitative, and includes subjective estimates based on assumptions regarding future revenue growth rates, discount rate and expected margins. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value determined, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We recorded an impairment charge of $114.0 million for goodwill of one of our reporting units during the year ended December 31, 2020. We did not record impairment charges relating to our goodwill or our indefinite-lived intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have two stock-based compensation plans, as described in further detail in Note 14 - Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate the probability that certain of our stock-based plans will meet targets established within the respective agreements and result in the vesting of such awards. For new awards issued and awards modified, repurchased or canceled, the compensation expense is equal to the fair value of the award at the date of the grant and is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for those awards over the requisite service period of the\naward. The fair value is determined by calculating the share price on the date of grant less the discounted value of the expected dividends to be paid over the vesting period.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements such as securitization agreements, liquidity trust vehicles or special purpose entities. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K and the documents incorporated in this Form 10-K by reference contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These \"forward-looking statements\" are based on an analysis of currently available competitive, financial and economic data and our operating plans. They are inherently uncertain and investors should recognize that events and actual results could turn out to be significantly different from our expectations. By way of illustration, when used in this document, words such as \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"project\", \"will\", \"should\", \"could\", \"may\", \"predict\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. You are cautioned that actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of us or our management, are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us and the industry in which we operate, including, among other things:\n \u2022 our ability to continue to develop or acquire new and useful technology; \n \u2022 the realization of anticipated synergies from acquired businesses and future acquisitions; \n \u2022 our dependence on one industry, oil and gas, and the impact of commodity prices on the expenditure levels of our clients; \n \u2022 competition in the markets we serve; \n \u2022 the risks and uncertainties attendant to adverse industry, political, economic and financial market conditions, including stock prices, government regulations, interest rates and credit availability; \n \u2022 unsettled political conditions, war, civil unrest, currency controls and governmental actions in the numerous countries in which we operate; \n \u2022 changes in the price of oil and natural gas; \n \u2022 major outbreak of global pandemic and restricting mobilization of field personnel; \n \u2022 weather and seasonal factors; \n \u2022 integration of acquired businesses; and \n \u2022 the effects of industry consolidation. \nOur businesses depend, to a large degree, on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Therefore, a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil, which could have a material impact on exploration, development and production activities, could also materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe above description of risks and uncertainties is by no means all-inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider. For a more detailed description of risk factors, please see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" in this Form 10-K and our reports and registration statements filed from time to time with the SEC.\nAll forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K are based on information available to us on the date of this Form 10-K. We do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements that we may make in this Form 10-K or other documents, reports, filings or press releases, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPronouncements Adopted in 2019\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 (\"Leases\"), which introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The new standard establishes a\nright-of-use (\"ROU\") model that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11 (\"Targeted Improvements to Leases\"), which provides companies with an additional transition method that allows the effects of the adoption of the new standard to be recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. We elected this optional transition method for adoption. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2019 had a material impact to our Consolidated Balance Sheet, but not to our Consolidated Statement of Operations or Cash Flows. The most significant impact was the recognition of $77.5 million of ROU assets and liabilities for operating leases, while our accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged.\nPronouncements Adopted in 2020\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 (\"Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\") which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2020, and there has been no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or on our accounting policies and processes.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 ( Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\u201d) which eliminates a step in computing the implied fair value of goodwill with a new methodology of an entity performing an annual goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2020. The new methodology was applied for the interim goodwill impairment analysis performed upon the triggering event of the COVID-19 pandemic during the three month period ended March 31, 2020, and it did not change the conclusion that goodwill had been impaired. There has been no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or on our accounting policies and processes as a result of adopting this updated accounting standard.", "item_7_tables":

The company operates through two segments: Reservoir Description and Production Enhancement. These departments deliver different services and products using various technologies aiming to evaluate, develop, and improve reservoir performance and recover oil and gas from new and existing fields.\n\nKey highlights from the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) include:\n\n- Demand for Core Laboratories' services and products correlates with clients' capital expenditures, which in turn often reflect oil and natural gas prices.\n- The company noticed a decline in the prices of WTI and Brent crude oil starting at the end of the first quarter of 2020, significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a substantial decrease in crude oil demand.\n- The rig count and activity levels in the U.S. onshore market are highly sensitive to crude oil prices.\n- Despite the price decline's negative impact on onshore activities, larger international and offshore projects tend to proceed as planned once initiated, showing resilience to short-term price volatility. \n- However, COVID-19 had such a detrimental effect on markets that it negatively impacted all energy markets in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, the operating results showcase a significant net loss mostly due to impairments, inventory write-downs, and other charges related to the drastic decrease in demand and crude oil prices caused by the pandemic. The company implemented cost reduction measures, adjusted capital expenditures, and reduced their quarterly dividends to focus on debt reduction.\n\nCore Laboratories' financial condition and results are intricately tied to the oil and gas industry, especially sensitive to the fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. Their long-term financial health depends on their continuous development of technology, favorable industry conditions, and successful integration of acquired businesses.\n\nFor liquidity and capital resources, the company relies on operations, borrowing from a credit facility, and the ability to issue additional equity and debt. They have reduced dividends and are focusing on paying down debt. The company is in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2020, and has plans in place to maintain liquidity and address upcoming debt maturities.\n\nThe company's financial statements consider estimates, particularly for matters like income taxes, potential impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, and stock-based compensation. They adopted new accounting standards in 2019 and 2020, which, among other things, changed how they recognize lease assets and liabilities and simplified the impairment testing for goodwill.\n\nDespite market challenges, Core Laboratories maintains a positive outlook, aiming to navigate the uncertain conditions by controlling costs, focusing on cash flow, and strengthening the balance sheet. Additionally, they plan to continue to support their clients with technological solutions and expect their performance to gradually improve as the global pandemic situation ameliorates and commodity prices stabilize or rise."}
