Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in \"Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information\" and \"Risk Factors\" included in this Annual Report.\nORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION\nOur discussion is presented in the following sections:\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Executive Summary\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Recent Developments and Management Action Plans\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating Segments\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Liquidity and Capital Resources\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Off-Balance Sheet Financing\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Application of Critical Accounting Estimates\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nAmerican Media, Inc. together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Company\", \"AMI\", \"we\", \"our\" or \"us\") is one of the largest publishers of celebrity and health and active lifestyle magazines in the United States, with a diversified portfolio of 10 publications that have a combined monthly print and digital audience of more than 39 million readers and monthly on-line audience of approximately 49 million readers.\nIn August 2014, American Media, Inc. entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with AMI Parent Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the \"Parent\"), which is controlled by certain investors of AMI (collectively, the \"Investors\"), and AMI Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the \"Merger Sub\"), whereby the Merger Sub was merged with and into American Media, Inc. (the \"Merger\") with American Media, Inc. surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent. As a result of the Merger, the Parent acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of American Media, Inc.\nIn January 2015, we sold our Shape, Fit Pregnancy and Natural Health publications, which comprised our Women's Active Lifestyle segment, for approximately $60 million in cash plus an earnout of up to $60 million. As a result, the operations of the Women's Active Lifestyle segment have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. After giving effect to the divestiture of our Women's Active Lifestyle segment, we report under a new segment structure beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and accordingly have recast prior period segment amounts.\nOur remaining well-known publications cover two primary operating segments: Celebrity and Men's Active Lifestyle. Within our Celebrity segment, our portfolio of brands includes: National Enquirer, Star, OK!, Globe, National Examiner and Soap Opera Digest. Within our Men's Active Lifestyle segment, our portfolio of brands include: Men's Fitness, Muscle & Fitness, Muscle & Fitness Hers and Flex. Our third, non-operating segment, Corporate and Other, includes our international licensing of certain health and fitness publications, photo syndication for all our media content platforms and strategic management services for publishers.\nWe believe our leadership position in these segments provides us with strong competitive advantages in the publishing market. Our iconic brands have enabled us to build a loyal readership and establish relationships with major advertisers and distributors. We have leveraged the strength of our portfolio of brands through joint ventures, licensing opportunities, and strategic relationships with several national retailers. We believe the combination of our well-known brands, established relationship with advertisers and distributors, and ability to leverage our brands with major retailers and to monetize content across multiple platforms creates a competitive position that is difficult to replicate.\nOur largest revenue stream comes from single copy newsstand sales. Our second largest revenue stream comes from multi-platform advertising. Our primary operating expenses consist of production, distribution, circulation and other cost of sales, as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. We incur most of our operating expenses during the production of our printed magazines, which includes costs for printing and paper. Paper is the principal raw material utilized in our publications. We have a long-term paper supply and purchasing agreement with the largest paper supply broker in the United States which manages all aspects of our raw material paper inventory. The price of paper is driven by market conditions and therefore difficult to predict. Changes in paper prices could significantly affect our business.\nWe are experiencing declines in our circulation revenue and print advertising as a result of market conditions in the magazine publishing industry. These declines are primarily caused by the disruption in our wholesaler distribution channel, the overall decline in the celebrity newsstand market and the decline in the consumer advertising market coupled with the shift in advertising dollars from print to digital. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and current events. Since magazines are generally discretionary purchases for consumers, our circulation revenues are sensitive to economic downturns. Adverse changes in the markets we serve generally result in reductions in revenue as a result of lower consumer spending, which can lead to a reduction in advertising revenue.\nOur fiscal year ended on March 31, 2016 and is referred to herein as fiscal 2016. References to our fiscal year (e.g. \"fiscal 2016\") refer to our fiscal year ended March 31st of the applicable year.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND MANAGEMENT ACTION PLANS\nRecent Developments\nDigital Initiatives\nWe conduct our advertising sales through a combination of corporate and brand sales and marketing teams that sell advertising across multiple media platforms. Our salespeople are divided into specific brand teams, with each team focusing on selling marketing programs that integrate print, digital (such as mobile and desktop), social media and events for our clients. We are also the industry leader in creating sponsored content and native advertising. Combined, our sales teams cover all consumer advertising categories.\nWe have launched digital editions for all our brands on the following platforms: Next Issue Media, Apple, Google newsstand, Zinio, Amazon Kindle and Barnes & Noble's Nook. During fiscal 2016, our digital advertising revenue increased 40% over the comparable prior year period.\nPrint Initiatives\nThe relaunch of Men's Fitness continues to attract new luxury goods advertisers including Ralph Lauren, FIJI Water, Louis Vuitton, Nautica, Energizer and SlimFast. During fiscal 2016, total advertising revenues increased 9% for Men's Fitness as compared to the prior period.\nRelated Operations\nOver the past year, we have developed several unique brand extensions across multiple platforms.\nIn February 2016, we announced a partnership with Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson's company, Seven Bucks Productions. Mr. Johnson is one of the world's biggest box office stars with over $1.4 billion in ticket sales in 2015 and Seven Bucks Productions has over 50 movie, television and digital projects in development. Our initial venture will be a live television broadcast of the Mr. Olympia event from Las Vegas in September 2016. Mr. Johnson will be one of the co-hosts and we are currently in negotiations with a leading broadcast network to air the live broadcast of the Mr. Olympia event.\nWe currently publish a custom magazine for GNC Holdings, Inc. (\"GNC\") on a quarterly basis, utilizing our Men's Fitness (and Shape pursuant to a license agreement) brands. The print version is distributed to approximately 500,000 customers through select GNC stores, with another 1 million digital copies distributed via email to GNC's database of customers. GNC leverages its vendors to advertise in the magazine and AMI retains 100% of the advertising revenues.\nThe REELZ Channel, available in 68 million homes, recently premiered a new television series, National Enquirer Investigates and the Discovery Channel will launch a series called Enquiring Minds this fall. We are partnering with The Weinstein Company on both of these televisions series. There is also a feature film and documentary drama television series on The National Enquirer in development with IMG/WME.\nDebt Related Transactions\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2016, AMI repurchased $2.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 11.5% per annum and mature in December 2017 (the \"First Lien Notes\"), plus accrued and unpaid interest in the open market, from the Investors.\nIn February 2016, we amended the revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\") to, among other things, extend the maturity date to June 2017, modify the financial covenants in effect through the date of maturity and provide for certain other provisions.\nIn March 2016, AMI exchanged approximately $58.9 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, held by the Investors, for approximately $76.0 million aggregate principal amount of new second lien senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 7.0% per annum and mature in July 2020 (the \"New Second Lien Notes\"), pursuant to an exchange agreement (the \"New Second Lien Notes Exchange Agreement\").\nIn addition to the New Second Lien Notes Exchange Agreement, AMI also issued, in March 2016, approximately $76.2 million in aggregate principal amount of New Second Lien Notes in a distribution to holders of equity interests in the Parent, of which approximately $68.8 million was issued to the Investors and approximately $7.4 million was issued to AMI's Chief Executive Officer (the \"Officer\"), and approximately $7.3 million aggregate principal amount of New Second Lien Notes were issued to an affiliate of the Investors in exchange for cash.\nIn March 2016, AMI repurchased the remaining $2.2 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 13.5% per annum and mature in June 2018 (the \"Second Lien Notes\"), plus accrued and unpaid interest in the open market. Upon the full satisfaction and cancellation of all outstanding Second Lien Notes, the collateral agreement securing the Second Lien Notes was terminated and AMI's obligations under the Indenture governing the Second Lien Notes were satisfied in full.\nSee \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Secured Notes\" within this Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" for a further discussion regarding our debt agreements.\nWholesaler Transition\nSeveral of our wholesalers, including our former second-largest wholesaler, Source Interlink Companies (\"Source\"), ceased operation during 2014. Since then we have transitioned the previous wholesalers' newsstand distribution (approximately 25% of the market) to the two remaining major wholesalers. This transition had an immediate adverse impact on single copy newsstand sales and liquidity during fiscal 2015 and into the first half of fiscal 2016.\nManagement Action Plans for Cost Savings\nDuring fiscal 2016, we developed and implemented management action plans that resulted in $18.4 million of cost savings in fiscal 2016 and that we expect will result in approximately $6.8 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017 (the \"2016 and 2017 Management Action Plans\"). These expense reductions were primarily from outsourcing technology and operating functions, digital content re-negotiations, print order efficiencies and editorial and advertising sales staff consolidations. We will realize the benefits from the 2016 and 2017 Management Action Plans during fiscal 2016 and beyond.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we developed and implemented management action plans that resulted in $6.6 million of cost savings in fiscal 2016 and $6.4 million of cost savings in fiscal 2015 (the \"2016 and 2015 Management Action Plans\"). These expense reductions were primarily from outsourcing technology and operating functions, digital content re-negotiations, and editorial and advertising sales expense reductions. We realized the benefits from the 2016 and 2015 Management Action Plans in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 and certain of these costs savings may benefit fiscal 2017 and beyond.\nReference to Management Action Plans refers to the 2016 and 2017 Management Action Plans and the 2016 and 2015 Management Action Plans.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides a summary of our operating results

</tr>\n</table>\n* - Represents an increase or decrease in excess of 100%.\nOperating Revenues\nDuring fiscal 2016, total operating revenues decreased $22.1 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to reduced circulation ($23.4 million), partially offset by increased advertising ($0.9 million) and other revenues ($0.3 million).\nCirculation revenue has declined due to the overall decline in the celebrity newsstand magazine market, coupled with the planned discontinuance of our special interest publications ($2.5 million) and certain foreign editions of Muscle & Fitness and Flex ($1.9 million), and the sale of our Country Weekly publication ($2.8 million). The increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to digital. Other revenue increased primarily due to the elimination of joint venture losses recognized in prior years coupled with the increase in revenue from the Mr. Olympia event, partially offset by reduced publishing services revenue.\nTotal operating revenue decreased $42.2 million during fiscal 2015 primarily due to reduced circulation ($21.4 million), advertising ($5.7 million) and other revenues ($15.1 million).\nCirculation revenue declined due to the industry-wide disruption in our wholesaler channel coupled with the decline in the celebrity newsstand magazine market. Advertising revenue declined due to the 11% decline in the consumer advertising market. The decline in other revenue was due to the divestiture of our distribution and merchandising business (DSI) in September 2013 ($5.2 million), coupled with an unfavorable timing of certain non-recurring revenue streams ($8.2 million), partially offset by higher revenue from the Mr. Olympia event ($1.3 million).\nThe following table summarizes our operating revenues, by type, as a percentage of total operating revenues:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal years ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Circulation\n</td> <td>64%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>31%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCirculation Revenue\nOur circulation revenue was generated from the following components for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal years ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single Copy\n</td> <td>78%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription\n</td> <td>22%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur circulation revenue, representing the sale of magazines to consumers, generates more than half of our total revenues and is an important component in determining our advertising revenues because advertising rates are dependent on circulation and audience. Single copy sales (also known as newsstand sales) are sold primarily through national distributors, wholesalers and retailers. Subscriptions are sold primarily through direct mail, or digitally via the Internet. Additionally, digital-only subscriptions and single-copy digital issues of our magazines are sold or distributed through various app stores and other digital storefronts. Our digital subscriptions represent 15% of our 2.0 million net subscriptions as of March 31, 2016, the highest percentage among our competitive set.\nCirculation revenue declined $23.4 million during fiscal 2016 due to the overall reduction in the celebrity magazine sector ($14.1 million) coupled with the planned discontinuance of our special interest publications ($2.5 million) and certain foreign editions of Muscle & Fitness and Flex ($1.9 million), and the sale of our Country Weekly publication ($2.8 million). During fiscal 2015, circulation revenue declined $21.4 million primarily due to the wholesaler transition ($16.6 million) coupled with the sale of our Country Weekly publication ($2.5 million).\nAdvertising Revenue\nOur advertising revenue was generated from the following components for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal years ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Print\n</td> <td>80%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Digital\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe sale of advertising across our multiple platforms generates approximately one-third of our total revenues. Print advertising revenue continues to be negatively impacted by the decline in the consumer magazine sector coupled with the transformation of advertising from print to digital.\nWe conduct our advertising sales through a combination of corporate and brand sales and marketing teams that sell advertising across multiple media platforms. Our salespeople are divided into specific brand teams, with each team focusing on selling marketing programs that integrate print, digital (such as mobile and desktop), social media and events for our clients. We are also the industry leader in creating sponsored content and native advertising. Combined, our sales teams cover all consumer advertising categories.\nThe rates at which we sell print advertising depend on each magazine's rate base, which is the circulation of the magazine that we guarantee to our advertisers, as well as our audience size. If we are not able to meet our committed rate base, the price paid by advertisers is generally subject to downward adjustments, including in the form of future credits or discounts. Our published rates for each of our magazines are subject to negotiation with each of our advertisers.\nAdvertising revenue increased $0.9 million during fiscal 2016 due to higher digital advertising ($4.1 million), partially offset by the decline in print advertising ($0.4 million) and the planned discontinuance of certain foreign editions of Muscle & Fitness and Flex ($2.3 million) and the sale of Country Weekly ($0.5 million). During fiscal 2015, advertising revenue decreased $5.7 million due to lower print advertising revenue ($7.7 million), partially offset by higher digital advertising ($2.0 million).\nOther Revenue\nOur other revenue represented 5% of our operating revenues during fiscal 2016 and 2015 and10% during fiscal 2014.\nDuring fiscal 2016, other revenue increased $0.3 million due to the timing of certain non-recurring streams, partially offset by the reduction in publishing services.\nOther revenues decreased $15.1 million during fiscal 2015 primarily due to the divestiture of our distribution and merchandising company (DSI) in September 2013 ($5.2 million) coupled with an unfavorable timing of certain non-recurring revenue streams ($8.2 million), partially offset by the increased revenue from the Mr. Olympia event ($1.3 million).\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses are comprised of the following for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal years ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Production\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Editorial\n</td> <td>24.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution, circulation and other\n</td> <td>36.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs of revenues:\n</td> <td>115.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>55.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(36\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>26.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(53.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* - Represents an increase or decrease in excess of 100%.\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues consist of costs related to the production of our printed magazines, editorial costs, as well as other expenses.\nOur production costs, including paper and printing costs, accounted for approximately 28%, 26% and 30%, respectively, of our total operating expenses for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. Paper is the principal raw material utilized in our publications and we have a long-term paper supply and purchasing agreement with the largest paper supply broker in the United States.\nEditorial costs include costs associated with manuscripts, photographs and related salaries and accounted for approximately 13%, 11% and 12%, respectively for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nOur distribution, circulation and other expenses consist primarily of postage and freight for shipment to our wholesalers and fulfillment companies and accounted for approximately 18%, 16% and 18%, respectively, of our total operating expenses for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. We are subject to postal rate increases that affect delivery costs and effective May 31, 2015, rates for all classes of mail were increased by approximately 2% by the Postal Regulation Commission.\nTotal costs of revenues decreased during fiscal 2016 and 2015 due to the Management Action Plans in the following areas: $11.8 million in production, $1.9 million in editorial and $2.8 million in distribution and circulation for fiscal 2016 and a reduction of $9.6 million in production, $4.1 million in editorial and $7.0 million in distribution and circulation for fiscal 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative costs decreased $31.2 million during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the Management Action Plans for employee-related expenses ($12.2 million), as well as reduced wholesaler-related bad debt expense ($8.4 million), accounting and legal fees ($1.6 million), other non-recurring expenses ($3.5 million) and costs associated with restructuring ($1.5 million).\nDuring fiscal 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $8.3 million as compared to the prior year periods primarily due the Merger and related transactions ($4.8 million), bad debt expense due to the wholesaler bankruptcy ($3.3 million), costs associated with restructuring ($1.5 million) and the timing of gains from insurance settlement recognized in the prior comparable period ($1.4 million), partially offset by the divestiture of our distribution and merchandising company (DSI) in September 2013 ($2.1 million).\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses, which are non-cash, increased $12.5 million and $0.5 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to the reclassification of certain tradenames from indefinite-lived to finite-lived.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThere were no impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2016.\nDuring an evaluation of goodwill and other identified intangible assets during fiscal 2015 and 2014, we determined that indicators were present in certain reporting units that would suggest the fair value of the reporting unit may have declined below the carrying value. This decline was primarily the result of the near-term advertising revenue shortfall coupled with the continued softness in the print publication industry overall, which resulted in lowered future cash flow projections.\nAs a result, an impairment test of goodwill and identified intangible assets was performed for certain reporting units. The evaluation resulted in the carrying value of goodwill and tradenames for certain reporting units to exceed the fair value. As a result, the Company recorded pre-tax non-cash impairment charge totaling $18.5 million for goodwill and tradenames during fiscal 2015 and $9.2 million for tradenames during fiscal 2014, respectively.\nNon-Operating Items\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $11.2 million and $7.5 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, when compared to the prior year period due to the exchange, in March 2016 and January 2015, of certain senior secured notes.\nAmortization of Deferred Financing Costs\nAmortization of deferred financing costs remained consistent during fiscal 2016 and increased $2.3 million during fiscal 2015, when compared to the prior year period due to the exchange, in March 2016 and January 2015, of certain senior secured notes.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $36.0 million and $15.7 million and during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance. This was a direct result of the reclassification of certain tradenames from indefinite lived to finite lived effective October 1, 2014 and April 1, 2015.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to American Media, Inc.\nThe $17.0 million of net income attributable to American Media, Inc. for fiscal 2016 represents a $44.1 million improvement from the comparable prior year period. This improvement is primarily attributable to the $31.5 million increase in operating income, the $20.3 million increase in benefit for income taxes coupled with the $11.2 million decrease in interest expense, partially offset by the $15.3 million decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax and the $3.7 million decrease in other income.\nThe $27.1 million of net loss attributable to American Media, Inc. for fiscal 2015 represents a $27.2 million improvement from the comparable prior year period. This improvement is primarily attributable to the $46.3 million decrease in provision for income taxes, the $11.6 million increase in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, and the $7.5 million decrease in interest expense, partially offset by the $39.6 million decrease in operating income.\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\nOur operating segments consist of: Celebrity Brands, Men's Active Lifestyle and Corporate and Other. After the divestiture of our Women's Active Lifestyle segment, we report under a new segment structure beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Given this change, we have restated prior period segment information to correspond to the current reporting structure. This structure is organized according to the markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing the best content to a wide range of consumers.\nOur operating segments consist of the following brands in print and digital, as of March 31, 2016:\nCelebrity Brands Segment\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>National Enquirer, a weekly, hard news, investigating tabloid covering all celebrities, politics, crime, human interest, health and fashion.

Corporate overhead expenses are not allocated to other segments and are as follows: corporate executives, production, circulation, information technology, accounting, legal, human resources, business development and administrative department costs.\nFinancial Information Regarding Our Operating Segments\nWe use operating income (loss) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments and present operating income (loss) before impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, if any, to provide a consistent and comparable measure of our performance between periods. Management uses operating income (loss) before impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, if any, when communicating financial results to the board of directors, stockholders, debt holders and investors as well as when determining performance goals for executive compensation. Management believes this non-GAAP measure, although not a substitute for GAAP, improves comparability. Management also believes our stockholders, debt holders and investors use this measure as a gauge to assess the performance of their investment in the Company.\nWe prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. Our calculations of operating income (loss) herein may be different from the calculations used by other companies, therefore comparability may be limited. The accounting policies for the operating segments are the same as those described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report, specifically Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\nThe following table summarizes our total operating revenues by segment:\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal years ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Celebrity Brands\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>164.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Men's Active Lifestyle\n</td> <td>55.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(11\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and Other\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>223.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>245.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>287.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(42.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal operating revenues decreased $22.1 million during fiscal 2016 primarily due to reduced circulation ($23.4 million), partially offset by increased advertising ($0.9 million) and other revenues ($0.3 million).

The pre-tax non-cash impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets was $18.5 million and $9.2 million, respectively during fiscal 2015 and 2014, and impacted the Men's Active Lifestyle segment goodwill and tradenames. The pre-tax non-cash impairment charges were primarily the result of the near-term advertising revenue shortfall coupled with the continued softness in the print publication industry overall, which resulted in lowered future cash flow projections. See the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report, specifically Note 3, \"Goodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets.\"\nCelebrity Brands Segment\nThe Celebrity Brands segment comprised 74%, 73% and 71% our total operating revenues for fiscal 2016, 2015 for fiscal 2014, respectively.\nOperating Revenues\nTotal operating revenues in the Celebrity Brands segment were $164.4 million for fiscal 2016, representing a decrease of $15.5 million, or 9%, over the comparable prior year period. For our continuing publications, total operating revenues declined $10.1 million, or 6%. Circulation revenue declined $14.1 million, or 10%, due to a reduction in the celebrity newsstand market of 12%. This was partially offset by the 11% increase in advertising revenue ($3.0 million) from National Enquirer, OK! and Star, which is counterintuitive to the consumer advertising market, which was down 10%. Total operating revenues were further impacted by the planned discontinuance of our special interest publications ($2.5 million) and the sale of Country Weekly ($2.8 million).\nDuring fiscal 2015, total operating revenues in the Celebrity Brands segment were $179.8 million, representing a decrease of $22.8 million, or 11%, over the comparable prior year period. For our continuing publications, total operating revenues declined $19.2 million, or 10%. Circulation revenue declined $16.6 million, or 10%, due to a reduction in the celebrity newsstand sales primarily due to the industry-wide newsstand distribution disruption, coupled with the 6% decline in advertising revenue ($1.7 million) due to the 11% decline in the consumer magazine sector. Total operating revenues were further impacted by the planned discontinuance of our special interest publications ($0.8 million) and the sale of Country Weekly ($2.5 million).\nOperating Income\nThe Celebrity Brands segment operating income before impairment decreased $13.8 million, or 20%, to $54.1 million during fiscal 2016. This decline was due to the revenue declines previously discussed coupled with an increase in amortization expenses ($11.3 million) related to the reclassification of certain tradenames from indefinite-lived intangibles to finite-lives of 15 years, effective April 1, 2015. These declines are partially offset by the planned reduction in expenses ($13.1 million) pursuant to our Management Action Plans.\nOperating income before impairment in the Celebrity Brands segment decreased during fiscal 2015 from prior year by $5.4 million, or 7%, to $67.9 million. This decline was due to the revenue declines mentioned above, partially offset by the planned reduction in expenses ($17.4 million) pursuant to our Management Action Plans.\nMen's Active Lifestyle Segment\nThe Men's Active Lifestyle segment represented 25%, 24% and 23% of our consolidated operating revenues for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOperating Revenues\nTotal operating revenues in the Men's Active Lifestyle segment were $55.6 million during fiscal 2016, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 6%, over the comparable prior year period. This decline was due to the discontinuance of certain foreign editions of Muscle & Fitness and Flex ($4.9 million) coupled with the decline in print advertising ($1.1 million). These declines were partially offset by the increase in digital advertising revenue ($2.0 million), primarily from Men's Fitness ($1.1 million) and Muscle & Fitness ($0.9 million) due to a 17% and 11% increase in page views, respectively, coupled with the increase in revenue from the Mr. Olympia event ($0.8 million or 12%).\nDuring fiscal 2015, total operating revenues in the Men's Active Lifestyle segment were $59.2 million, a decrease $7.5 million, or 11%, over the comparable prior year period. The decline in circulation revenue ($2.6 million) and print advertising revenue ($7.1 million) was primarily due to the reduction in the publishing frequency of Muscle & Fitness and Flex, from twelve times per year to ten times per year (or two less issues) during fiscal 2015. Print advertising revenue has also been negatively impacted during fiscal 2015 by a major advertiser who shifted their entire advertising budget ($4.0 million) from print to digital and social advertising platform investments outside the Men's Active Lifestyle category. A portion of this advertising business did return to the Men's Active Lifestyle segment during fiscal 2016. These declines were partially offset by the increase in digital advertising revenue ($1.3 million), which is directly attributable to the relaunch and repositioning of Men's Fitness, and the increased revenues from the Mr. Olympia event ($1.3 million, or 26%).\nOperating Income\nThe Men's Active Lifestyle segment operating income before impairment increased $1.6 million, or 13% to $13.1 million during fiscal 2016. Our planned Management Action Plans reduced expenses by $6.5 million, which was partially offset by an increase in amortization expense ($1.4 million) related to certain tradenames as discussed above coupled with the revenue decline previously mentioned.\nOperating income before impairment in the Men's Active Lifestyle segment declined during fiscal 2015 from the prior year by $9.4 million, or 45%, to $11.6 million. This decline is due to the reasons mentioned above coupled with an increase in amortization expense related to the classification of certain tradenames ($1.5 million).\nCorporate and Other Segment\nThe Corporate and Other segment was 1%, 3% and 6% of our consolidated operating revenues for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOperating Revenues\nTotal operating revenues in the Corporate and Other segment were $3.1 million during fiscal 2016, a decline of $3.1 million, or 50%, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the planned reduction in publishing services ($1.3 million) and books publishing ($0.3 million).\nDuring fiscal 2015, total operating revenues in the Corporate and Other segment were $6.1 million, a decrease of $11.9 million, or 66%, from the prior year. This decline was attributable to the divestiture of our distribution and merchandising company in September 2013 ($5.2 million), the timing of the custom video projects for Microsoft ($4.7 million) and the cessation of certain publishing services ($2.3 million).\nOperating Loss\nTotal operating loss before impairment decreased by $25.3 million, or 38%, to $41.5 million during fiscal 2016, compared to the prior year period. This improvement was attributable to the Management Action Plans for employee-related expenses ($11.3 million), as well as reduced wholesaler bad debt expenses ($7.3 million), accounting and legal fees ($1.3 million) and the other non-recurring expenses ($3.5 million), partially offset by the $3.1 million decline in operating revenue previously discussed.\nDuring fiscal 2015, total operating loss before impairment increased by $15.6 million, or 30%, to $66.8 million. This increase was attributable to the $11.9 million decline in operating revenue coupled with a $3.6 million increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the bad debt expense related to the wholesaler shutdowns ($3.3 million) and the costs incurred for the Merger and other related transactions ($3.4 million), coupled with the timing of the gains on insurance settlement recognized in the prior comparable period ($1.4 million). These expense increases were partially offset by the $5.2 million decrease in operating expenses related to the divestiture of our distribution and merchandising business.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nManagement's Assessment of Liquidity\nOur operations have historically generated positive net cash flow from operating activities. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from operations, amounts available under our revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\") and cash interest savings from our recent debt initiatives.\nOur principal uses of cash that affect our liquidity include operational expenditures and debt service costs, including interest payments on and repurchases of our senior secured notes. In addition to the dispositions discussed elsewhere, we expect to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. These transactions, if consummated, could be material and may involve cash or the issuance of additional senior secured notes.\nAs of March 31, 2016, the Company had $1.4 million of cash, $15.4 million available pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility and a working capital deficit of $32.7 million, of which approximately $26.6 million relates to deferred revenues. In February 2016, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date to June 2017 and modify the financial covenants in effect through the date of maturity.\nIn addition to outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, as of March 31, 2016, there was $378.7 million principal amount of outstanding senior secured debt. Over the next year, the cash interest payments due under these debt agreements are approximately $40.2 million and there are no scheduled principal payments due.\nWe expect that our current cash balances, cash generated from operating activities, availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, and the cash interest savings from the recent debt initiatives should be sufficient to meet working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other cash needs for the next year.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences for the business and operations. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" included in this Annual Report, specifically, \"Our substantial indebtedness and our ability to incur additional indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and result of operations.\"\nWholesaler Transition\nSeveral of our wholesalers, including our former second-largest wholesaler, Source Interlink Companies (\"Source\"), ceased operation during 2014. Since then we have transitioned the previous wholesalers' newsstand distribution (approximately 25% of the market) to the two remaining major wholesalers. This transition had an immediate adverse impact on single copy newsstand sales and liquidity during fiscal 2015 and into the first half of fiscal 2016. We are beginning to see a stabilization in the newsstand sales, and the wholesale supply chain currently and primarily consists of two private companies, owned by billionaires, that have been in the business for decades.\nThere can be no assurances that our revenue will not be temporarily or permanently reduced if consumers at the impacted retailers do not resume purchasing our publications at the same rate or quantities previously purchased. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" included in this Annual Report, specifically, \"Our circulation revenue consists of single copy sales distributed to retailers primarily by two wholesalers and the loss of either of these wholesalers could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\"\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following information has been derived from the accompanying consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2.1 million during fiscal 2016 and increased $0.4 million during fiscal 2015. The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal years ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(53.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>55.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(67.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effects of exchange rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by our non-cash items, changes in working capital and the impact of our results of operations. Non-cash items consist primarily of the provision (benefit) for deferred income taxes, depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred financing costs and deferred rack costs and provisions for doubtful accounts.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 million and $12.7 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decline of $9.2 million, primarily due to the $30.9 million net decrease in non-cash items coupled with the $22.2 million net change in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by the $43.9 million increase in our results of operations.\nNon-cash items decreased primarily due to the decrease in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $18.5 million, the decrease in provision for doubtful accounts of $8.7 million, the decrease in non-cash payment-in-kind interest accretion of $4.8 million for certain senior secured notes, the increase in benefit for income taxes of $3.9 million and the decrease in the loss on sale of assets of $2.5 million, partially offset by the increase in depreciation and amortization of $11.6 million.\nThe net change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to the $35.6 million net change in accounts payable and accrued expenses,\nthe $10.3 million net change in inventories resulting from our agreement to outsource paper purchases and the $4.3 million net change in prepaid expenses, partially offset by the $20.6 million net change in trade receivables, the net change in deferred revenue of $3.8 million, the net change in accrued interest of $3.4 million and the net change in deferred rack costs of $2.7 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $2.9 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the $27.4 million increase in our results of operations coupled with the $16.0 million net change in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by the $40.5 million net increase in non-cash items.\nNon-cash items decreased primarily due to the decrease in provision for income taxes of $64.7 million, partially offset by the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $9.2 million, the increase in provision for doubtful accounts of $3.4 million, the loss on sale of assets of $2.5 million, the increase in non-cash payment-in-kind interest accretion of $2.9 million for certain senior secured notes and the net decrease in amortization of deferred rack and deferred financing costs of $1.6 million.\nThe net change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to the $7.6 million net change in inventories resulting from our agreement to outsource paper purchases, the $6.7 million net change in prepaid expenses, the $3.6 million net change in accounts payable and accrued expenses, the $3.4 million net change in trade receivables, partially offset by the net change in deferred revenue of $2.7 million and the net change in accrued interest of $2.2 million.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.7 million for fiscal 2016, a decrease of $58.3 million, compared to $55.7 million of net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to the $63.0 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets and the $2.6 million decrease in proceeds from affiliates, partially offset by the $7.2 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment and intangibles assets.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $55.7 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $74.5 million compared to $18.8 million of net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to the $63.0 million in proceeds from the sale of assets and the $2.6 million in proceeds from affiliates coupled with the $2.5 million decrease in investment in affiliates plus the $6.2 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2016 was $2.6 million, a decrease of $64.6 million, compared to $67.2 million of net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to the $53.7 million decrease in repurchases of certain senior secured notes, the $14.8 million decrease in net borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the $4.3 million decrease in costs incurred in the restructuring, partially offset by the $5.5 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of certain senior secured notes and the $2.3 million increase in deferred financing costs.\nNet cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2015 was $67.2 million, an increase of $76.7 million, compared to $9.5 million of net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to the $55.8 million increase in repurchases of certain senior secured notes, the $31.3 million decrease in net borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by the $12.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of certain senior secured notes and the $4.0 million decrease in payments for the redemption of Odyssey preferred stock.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Senior Secured Notes\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe maintain a revolving credit facility that provides for borrowing up to $35.0 million, less outstanding letters of credit, which matures in June 2017 (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"). The Investors became a lending party to the Revolving Credit Facility during fiscal 2015 and represent a commitment of approximately 42% of the Revolving Credit Facility. See \"Revolving Credit Facility Amendments\" below for additional historical information.\nWe have the option to pay interest based on (i) a floating base rate option equal to the greatest of (x) the prime rate in effect on such day; (y) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus \u00bd of 1%; and (z) one month LIBOR (but no less than 2%) plus 1%, or (ii) LIBOR, in each case, plus a margin. The interest rate under the Revolving Credit Facility has ranged from 8.00% to 8.50% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.50% to 0.75% on the unused portion of the revolving commitment. Commitment fees paid during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were insignificant.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we borrowed $72.7 million and repaid $72.2 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. At March 31, 2016, the available borrowing capacity is $15.4 million, after considering the $15.2 million outstanding balance and the $4.4 million outstanding letter of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility is included in non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements based on the June 2017 maturity date.\nThe indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain of the domestic subsidiaries of the Company and is secured by liens on substantially all the assets of the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries. In addition, the Company's obligations are secured by a pledge of all the issued and outstanding shares of, or other equity interests in, certain of the Company's existing or subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries and a percentage of the capital stock of, or other equity interests in, certain of its existing or subsequently acquired or organized foreign subsidiaries.\nCovenants\nThe Revolving Credit Facility includes certain representations and warranties, conditions precedent, affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants include financial maintenance covenants comprised of a first lien leverage ratio, a consolidated leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict paying dividends, incurring additional indebtedness, creating liens, making acquisitions or other investments, entering into certain mergers or consolidations and selling or otherwise disposing of assets. With respect to the dividend restrictions, there is a cap on the total amount of cash available for distribution to our common stockholders.\nWith regard to the financial maintenance covenants, the first lien leverage ratio covenant must be equal to or less than 3.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017. The consolidated leverage ratio covenant must be equal to or less than 5.50 to 1.00 from October 1, 2015 through June 2017. The interest coverage ratio must be equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nAlthough there can be no assurances, management believes that, based on current projections (including projected borrowings and repayments under the Revolving Credit Facility), its operating results for fiscal 2017 will be sufficient to satisfy the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company's ability to satisfy the financial covenants is dependent on the business performing in accordance with its projections. If the performance of the Company's business deviates significantly from its projections, the Company may not be able to satisfy such financial covenants. The Company's projections are subject to a number of factors, many of which are events beyond its control, which could cause its actual results to differ materially from its projections. If the Company does not comply with its financial covenants, the Company will be in default under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nRevolving Credit Facility Amendments\nIn December 2010, we entered into a revolving credit facility with an original maturity date of December 2015 with a commitment for borrowing up to $40.0 million, less outstanding letters of credit. In February 2015, we amended and restated the revolving credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date to December 2016, reduce the borrowing capacity from $40.0 million to $35.0 million and amend the first lien leverage ratio and certain other covenants and provisions.\nIn February 2016, the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent\u201d), and the lenders from time to time party to the Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, restated, modified or supplemented from time to time, entered into the first amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility with the lenders (the Consenting Lenders\u201d) constituting the Required Lenders (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) to, among other things, extend the maturity date to June 2017, modify the financial covenants in effect through the date of maturity, and provide for certain other provisions.\nWith regard to the financial covenants, the first lien leverage ratio covenant must be equal to or less than 4.25 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017, provided that the first lien leverage ratio covenant will be lowered to 4.00 to 1.00 if the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company's first lien notes is less than $250 million. The consolidated leverage ratio covenant must be equal to or less than 5.25 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017, provided that the consolidated leverage ratio covenant will be lowered to 5.00 to 1.00 if the outstanding principal amount of the Company's first lien notes is less than $250 million. The interest coverage ratio was not amended and must be equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017.\nIn March 2016, the Company, the Administrative Agent and the lenders from time to time party to the Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, restated, modified or supplemented from time to time, entered into the second amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility with the Consenting Lenders constituting the Required Lenders to, among other things, allow for the issuance of additional indebtedness, modify the financial covenants in effect through the date of maturity, and provide for certain other provisions.\nWith regard to the financial covenants, the first lien leverage ratio covenant must be equal to or less than 3.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017 and the provision to lower the first lien leverage ratio based on the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company's first lien notes was removed in its entirety. The consolidated leverage ratio must be equal to or less than 5.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017 and the provision to lower the consolidated leverage ratio based on the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company's first lien notes was removed in its entirety. The interest coverage ratio was not amended and must be equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017.\nSenior Secured Notes\nOur senior secured notes may be comprised of the first lien notes, the second lien notes, the new second lien notes and the second lien PIK notes and are collectively referred to herein as the \"Senior Secured Notes.\" See \"Supplemental Indentures\" below for a discussion of the amendments to the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes.\nFirst Lien Notes\nIn December 2010, we issued $385.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 11.5% per annum, payable semi-annually, and mature in December 2017 (the \"First Lien Notes\").\nDuring fiscal 2012, we redeemed $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately $2.3 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes in the open market, from the Investors. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased $55.5 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes in the open market, from the Investors. We also exchanged $32.0 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes held by the Investors, for approximately $39.0 million aggregate principal amount of new second lien senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 7.0% per annum and mature in July 2020 (the \"New Second Lien Notes\"), pursuant to an exchange agreement.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we repurchased $2.0 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes, at a price equal to 105.9% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest in the open market, from the Investors. In March 2016, we exchanged approximately $58.9 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, held by the Investors, for approximately $76.0 million in aggregate principal amount of New Second Lien Notes, pursuant to an exchange agreement (the \"New Second Lien Notes Exchange Agreement\"), as further described below.\nAt March 31, 2016, the First Lien Notes represented an aggregate of $214.3 million of our indebtedness.\nThe First Lien Notes are guaranteed on a first lien senior secured basis by the same subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility. The First Lien Notes and the guarantees thereof are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all our assets (subject to certain permitted liens and exceptions), pari passu with the liens granted under our Revolving Credit Facility, provided that in the event of a foreclosure on the collateral or insolvency proceedings, obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid in full with proceeds from the collateral prior to the obligations under the First Lien Notes.\nSecond Lien Notes\nIn December 2010, we issued $104.9 million aggregate principal amounts of senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 13.5% per annum, payable semi-annually, and mature in June 2018 (the \"Second Lien Notes\").\nDuring fiscal 2014, we exchanged approximately $94.3 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes for an equal aggregate principal amount of new second lien senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 10.0% per annum, are payable in kind, and mature in June 2018 (the Second Lien PIK Notes\u201d). See \"Second Lien PIK Notes\" below. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately $0.6 million in aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes in the open market, from the Investors and exchanged approximately $7.8 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes for equity interests in the Parent pursuant to the debt for equity exchange agreement (as discussed below).\nDuring fiscal 2016, we redeemed the remaining $2.2 million in aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes at a price equal to 103.4% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon the full satisfaction and cancellation of all outstanding Second Lien Notes, the collateral agreement securing the Second Lien Notes was terminated and the obligations of the Company under the Indenture governing the Second Lien Notes were satisfied in full.\nThe Second Lien Notes were guaranteed on a second lien senior secured basis by the same subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee our Revolving Credit Facility and the First Lien Notes. The Second Lien Notes and the guarantees thereof were secured by a second-priority lien on substantially all our assets (subject to certain permitted liens and exceptions).\nNew Second Lien Notes\nIn January 2015, we issued approximately $39.0 million aggregate principal amount of New Second Lien Notes to the Investors, which bear interest at a rate of 7.0% per annum and mature in July 2020. Interest on the New Second Lien Notes is payable semi-annually on July 15th and January 15th of each year and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30 day months. As described above, the New Second Lien Notes were issued in exchange for $32.0 million aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes pursuant to an exchange agreement.\nThe New Second Lien Notes were issued under a new indenture (the New Second Lien Notes Indenture\u201d), by and among American Media, Inc., certain of its subsidiaries listed as guarantors thereto (the \"Guarantors\") and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the \"Trustee\"). The New Second Lien Notes were issued through a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nIn March 2016, we issued approximately $159.6 million aggregate principal amount of additional New Second Lien Notes (the \"Additional New Second Lien Notes\"). Approximately $76.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Additional New Second Lien Notes were issued in exchange for approximately $58.9 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes pursuant to the New Second Lien Notes Exchange Agreement, as described above. Approximately $76.2 million in aggregate principal amount of Additional New Second Lien Notes were issued in a distribution to certain holders of equity interests in the Parent, of which approximately $68.8 million was issued to the Investors and approximately $7.4 million was issued to the Officer, and approximately $7.3 million aggregate principal amount of Additional New Second Lien Notes were issued to an affiliate of the Investors for cash.\nThe Additional New Second Lien Notes were issued under the existing New Second Lien Indenture through a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nAt March 31, 2016, the New Second Lien Notes represented an aggregate of $164.4 million of our indebtedness.\nThe New Second Lien Notes and the Additional New Second Lien Notes are guaranteed on a second lien senior secured basis by the same subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee our Revolving Credit Facility, the First Lien Notes and the Second Lien Notes. The New Second Lien Notes and the Additional New Second Lien Notes and the guarantees thereof are secured by a second-priority lien on substantially all our assets (subject to certain permitted liens and exceptions).\nSecond Lien PIK Notes\nDuring fiscal 2014, we issued approximately $94.3 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien PIK Notes in exchange for an equal aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes, pursuant to an exchange agreement (the \"Second Lien PIK Notes Exchange Agreement\"). The Second Lien PIK Notes were issued under an indenture (the \"Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture\"), by and among American Media, Inc., the Guarantors and Trustee.\nDuring fiscal 2015, in connection with the Merger Agreement, we issued approximately $12.3 million in aggregate principal amount of additional Second Lien PIK Notes (the \"Additional Second Lien PIK Notes\"). The Additional Second Lien PIK Notes were issued under the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture, were assigned the same CUSIP number as the outstanding Second Lien PIK Notes and were issued through a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nThe Second Lien PIK Notes were payable in kind at a rate of 10% per annum which totaled $4.8 million and $1.9 million, during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, and was recorded as an increase to the aggregate principal amount of Second Lien PIK Notes outstanding.\nIn September 2014, pursuant to the debt for equity exchange agreement with the Parent and the Investors, the Investors exchanged approximately $113.3 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien PIK Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, which represented all of the outstanding Second Lien PIK Notes, for equity interests in the Parent. Upon the cancellation of all outstanding Second Lien PIK Notes, the collateral agreement securing the Second Lien PIK Notes was terminated and the obligations of the Company under the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture were satisfied in full and the discharge thereof was acknowledged by the Trustee.\nDebt for Equity Conversion\nIn September 2014, AMI entered into the debt for equity exchange agreement with the Parent and the Investors, pursuant to which the Investors converted approximately $7.8 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes and all $113.3 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien PIK Notes into equity interests in the Parent (the Conversion\u201d). The Conversion also included the accrued and unpaid interest since the last semi-annual interest payment on June 15, 2014, totaling approximately $2.9 million.\nSupplemental Indentures\nIn August 2014, AMI received consents from the holders of (a) $218.2 million principal amount of the outstanding First Lien Notes to amend the indenture dated as of December 1, 2010 (as such agreement may be amended, restated or supplemented, the First Lien Notes Indenture\u201d), among AMI, the Guarantors and the Trustee, (b) $7.8 million principal amount of the outstanding Second Lien Notes to amend the indenture dated as of December 22, 2010 (as such agreement may be amended, restated or supplemented, the Second Lien Notes Indenture\u201d and, together with the First Lien Notes Indenture and the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture, the Indentures\u201d), among AMI, the Guarantors and the Trustee and (c) $101 million principal amount of the outstanding Second Lien PIK Notes to amend the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture, which in each case represented the requisite consents from holders of at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable notes then outstanding.\nAs a result of receiving the requisite consents, in August 2014, AMI and the Trustee entered into (a) the Fourth Supplemental Indenture (the First Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture\u201d) to the First Lien Notes Indenture, (b) the Third Supplemental Indenture (the Second Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture\u201d) to the Second Lien Notes Indenture and (c) the First Supplemental Indenture (the Second Lien PIK Notes Supplemental Indenture\u201d and, together with the First Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture and the Second Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture, the Supplemental Indentures\u201d) to the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture.\nThe Supplemental Indentures amend the Indentures to (a) permit the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement including amending the definition of Change of Control\u201d and permitting the issuance of the Additional Second Lien PIK Notes pursuant to the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture; and (b) in the case of the Second Lien PIK Notes Supplemental Indenture only, eliminate AMI's obligation to apply Cash Interest Savings (as defined in the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture) to repurchase outstanding First Lien Notes for the semi-annual interest periods ending on June 15, 2014 and December 15, 2014 (collectively, the Amendments\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Supplemental Indentures, the Supplemental Indentures became effective, and the Amendments became operative, immediately upon execution of the Supplemental Indentures.\nIn January 2015, we entered into a supplemental indenture (the 2015 Supplemental Indenture\u201d) by and between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as successor by merger to Wilmington Trust FSB, as trustee and collateral agent (collectively, the Existing Second Lien Trustee\u201d), to an indenture, dated as of December 22, 2010, by and among the Company, the guarantors party thereto and the Existing Second Lien Trustee (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified through the date of amendment, the Existing Second Lien Indenture\u201d). The 2015 Supplemental Indenture contemplates, among other things, the exchange of First Lien Notes for the New Second Lien Notes.\nIn March 2016, the Company received consents from the holders of (a) $266.1 million principal amount of the outstanding First Lien Notes to amend the indenture dated as of December 1, 2010 (as such agreement may be amended, restated or supplemented, the First Lien Notes Indenture\u201d), among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee and (b) $39.0 million principal amount of the outstanding New Second Lien Notes to amend the indenture dated as of January 20, 2015 (as such agreement may be amended, restated or supplemented, the New Second Lien Notes Indenture\u201d and, together with the First Lien Notes Indenture, the Indentures\u201d), among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee, which in each case represented the requisite consents from holders of at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.\nAs a result of receiving the requisite consents, in March 2016, the Company and the Trustee entered into (a) the Fifth Supplemental Indenture (the First Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture\u201d) to the First Lien Notes Indenture and (b) the First Supplemental Indenture (the New Second Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture\u201d and, together with the First Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture, the Supplemental Indentures\u201d). The Supplemental Indentures amend the First Lien Indenture and the New Second Lien Indenture, as applicable, to, among other things, permit the issuance of the Additional New Second Lien Notes.\nThe Indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes contain certain affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default. For example, the Indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes contain covenants that limit our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries, subject to important exceptions and qualifications, to: borrow money; guarantee other indebtedness; use assets as security in other transactions; pay dividends on stock, redeem stock or redeem subordinated debt; make investments; enter into agreements that restrict the payment of dividends by subsidiaries; sell assets; enter into affiliate transactions; sell capital stock of subsidiaries; enter into new lines of business; and merge or consolidate. In addition, the Indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes impose certain requirements as to future subsidiary guarantors.\nAs of March 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes.\nCovenant Compliance\nAs discussed above, our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes contain various restrictive covenants. With regard to our Revolving Credit Facility, the financial covenants are comprised of a first lien leverage ratio, a consolidated leverage rate and an interest coverage ratio.\nThe first lien leverage ratio covenant is calculated as the Total First Lien Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) and must be equal to or less than 3.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017, the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. The consolidated leverage ratio covenant is calculated as the Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) and must be equal to or less than 5.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017, the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. The interest coverage ratio covenant is calculated as the Consolidated EBITDA to Cash Interest Expense (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) and must be equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017, maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility.\nAs of March 31, 2016, the first lien leverage ratio was 3.05 to 1.00, the consolidated leverage ratio was 5.23 to 1.00 and the interest coverage ratio was 2.06 to 1.00 and the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Second Notes.\nAlthough there can be no assurances, management believes that, based on current expectations (including projected borrowings and repayments under the Revolving Credit Facility and our recent debt initiatives), our operating results for the next twelve months will be sufficient to satisfy the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. Our ability to satisfy such financial covenant is dependent on our business performing in accordance with our projections. If the performance of our business deviates from our projections, we may not be able to satisfy such financial covenants. Our projections are subject to a number of factors, many of which are events beyond our control, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections (see \"Risk Factors\" included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report). If we do not comply with our financial covenants, we would be in default under the Revolving Credit Facility, which could result in all our debt being accelerated due to cross-default provisions in the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes.\nWe have the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations imposed by our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes. Under our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes, in addition to specified permitted indebtedness, we will be able to incur additional indebtedness as long as on a pro forma basis our consolidated leverage ratio is less than 5.50 to 1.00.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA, a measure we use to gauge our operating performance, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to the Company plus interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, provision for impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, deferred financing costs and deferred rack costs, adjusted for merger and related transaction(s) costs, restructuring costs and severance, costs related to launches, re-launches or closures of publications and certain other costs. We believe that the inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to evaluate our operating performance compared to our operating plans and/or prior years and to value prospective acquisitions. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends because Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of certain items that can differ significantly from company to company, depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments.\nManagement believes our investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a gauge to measure the performance of their investment in the Company. Management compensates for limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures by using them to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP results alone can provide. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to income from continuing operations as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management's discretionary use as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to American Media, Inc. and subsidiaries to Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

Fluctuations in quarterly performance are also due to variations in our publication schedule and variability of audience traffic on our websites. Not all of our publications are published on a regular schedule throughout the year. Additionally, the publication schedule for our special interest publications can vary and lead to quarterly fluctuations in our operating results.\nAdvertising revenue from our magazines and websites is typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter due to our health and fitness magazines. During our fourth fiscal quarter, which begins on January 1st, advertisers and consumers are focused on the \"New Year and New You.\" Certain newsstand costs vary from quarter to quarter, particularly marketing costs associated with the distribution of our magazines.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding uncertainties that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to revenue, trade receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes and contingent liabilities.\nWe base our estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and other relevant factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates, judgments and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company's financial position and results of operations, and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The following accounting policies and estimates are those that management deems most critical. For a complete listing of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Revenues and associated accounts receivable are recorded net of provisions for estimated future returns, doubtful accounts and other allowances. Allowances for uncollectible receivables are estimated based upon a combination of write-off history, aging analysis and any specifically identified troubled accounts.\nNewsstand revenues are recognized based on the on-sale dates of magazines and are initially recorded based upon estimates of sales, net of brokerage, returns and estimates of newsstand related fees. Estimated returns are recorded based upon historical experience.\nPrint advertising revenues are recorded based on the on-sale dates of magazines when the advertisement appears in the magazine and are stated net of agency commissions and cash and sales discounts. Digital advertising revenues on the Company's websites are generally based on the sale of impression-based advertisements, which are recorded in the period in which the advertisements are served.\nOther revenues, primarily from licensing opportunities and strategic partnerships for our branded products as well as marketing services performed for third parties by DSI, are recognized when the service is performed.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company's goodwill and related indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate a potential impairment exists. Impairment losses, if any, are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated financial statements. The Company's reporting units consist of each of its publications and other consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe Company reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value. Impairment losses, if any, are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated financial statements.\nIn assessing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment, the Company makes estimates of fair value that are based on its projection of revenues, operating costs and cash flows of each reporting unit, considering historical and anticipated future results and general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies. The valuations employ a combination of income and market approaches to measure fair value. Changes in management's judgments and projections or assumptions used could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could materially change the impairment charge related to goodwill and tradenames. For a detailed description of impairment charges, see Note 3, Goodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets.\u201d\nThe Company did not record any impairment charges during fiscal 2016. The Company continues to evaluate goodwill and other identified intangible assets for impairment. Goodwill and other identified intangible assets are material components of the Company's financial statements and impairment charges to the Company's goodwill or other identified intangible assets in future periods could be material to the Company's results of operations.\nDuring an evaluation of goodwill and other identified intangible assets during fiscal 2015 (at September 30, 2014), the Company determined that indicators were present in certain reporting units which would suggest the fair value of the reporting unit may have declined below the carrying value. This decline was primarily due to the continuing softness in the consumer magazine sector, which impacts consumer and advertising spending, including further declines in certain advertising markets, resulting in lowered future cash flow projections.\nAs a result, an interim impairment test of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets was performed during fiscal 2015 for certain reporting units in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic No. 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d ( ASC 350\u201d). Impairment testing for goodwill is a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment charge, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. Impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible assets, consisting of tradenames, compares the fair value of the tradename to the carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded for any excess carrying value over fair value.\nThe evaluation resulted in the carrying value of goodwill and tradenames for certain reporting units to exceed the estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $8.9 million and $8.5 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and tradenames, respectively, during fiscal 2015.\nAs of March 31, 2016, we identified three reporting units with an excess fair value over carrying value of less than 25%. As of March 31, 2016, National Enquirer, Flex and Muscle & Fitness reporting units had goodwill balances of $59.0 million, $5.4 million and $13.4 million, respectively. For all other reporting units, the fair value is substantially in excess of carrying value as of March 31, 2016. While historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of the reporting units in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in the future additional impairment charges may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material. The Company will continue to monitor the recoverability of its remaining goodwill.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of interim or annual goodwill impairment tests will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as follows:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate (i.e. circulation and advertising decreases) especially in the markets we serve;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>An economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Volatility in debt markets resulting in higher discount rates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Unexpected regulatory changes for our advertisers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. When such factors, events or circumstances indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of the assets to measure recoverability. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds fair value computed on a discounted cash flow basis.\nThe Company did not record any impairment charges for long-lived tangible and intangible assets during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes requires a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on any changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income.\nRECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity (Topic 205 and Topic 360) (\"ASU 2014-08\") which raises the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations. Under this new guidance, a discontinued operation is (1) a component of an entity or group of components that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale that represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results or (2) an acquired business that is classified as held for sale on the acquisition date. This guidance also requires expanded or new disclosures for discontinued operations, individually material disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation, an entity's continuing involvement with a discontinued operation following disposal, and retained equity method investments in a discontinued operation. ASU 2014-08 was effective for the Company on April 1, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-08 did not have an impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (\"ASU 2015-17\"), which simplifies the presentation of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The new guidance no longer requires the presentation of current deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on a classified balance sheet, rather requiring all to be presented as non-current. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company prospectively adopted this guidance in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. As required by this guidance, all deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which is a change from our historical presentation wherein certain of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were classified as current and the remainder were classified as non-current. The March 31, 2015 balance sheet has not been retrospectively adjusted. As this guidance impacts presentation only, the adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have an impact on the results of operations or cash flows.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Topic 205) (\"ASU 2014-15\"), which establishes management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and setting rules for how this information should be disclosed in the financial statements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual period beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company has not determined the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20) (\"ASU 2015-01\"), which simplifies the income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidations, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (Topic 810) (\"ASU 2015-02\"), which changes the identification of variable interests, the variable interest characteristic for a limited partnership or similar entity and the primary beneficiary determination all of which are intended to improve the consolidation guidance as well as increase transparency and consistency of financial reporting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued a proposal for a one-year deferral of the effective date for ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASU 2014-09\"). Under this proposal, the standard would be effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. As a result of the one-year deferral, ASU 2014-09 will now be effective for the Company on April 1, 2018 using one of two retrospective application methods. The Company has not determined the potential effects on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (Subtopic 835-30) (\"ASU 2015-03\"), which requires the presentation of debt issuance costs to be reflected as a reduction from the face amount of the related debt, with amortization recorded as interest expense, rather than recording as a deferred asset. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2015, and requires retrospective application. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although it will change the financial statement classification of the deferred financing cost. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had $8.1 million and $6.4 million of net deferred financing costs, respectively, included on the consolidated balance sheets. Under the new guidance, the net deferred financing costs would offset the carrying amount of the respective debt on the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) (\"ASU 2015-11\"), which simplifies the measurement of inventory by requiring certain inventory to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim period within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements-Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting, to clarify that an entity may elect to present debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset, regardless of whether or not there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months and disclose certain information about the leasing arrangements. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and the interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in \"Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information\" and \"Risk Factors\" included in this Annual Report.\nORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION\nOur discussion is presented in the following sections:\n \u2022 Executive Summary \n \u2022 Recent Developments and Management Action Plans \n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 Operating Segments \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u2022 Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments \n \u2022 Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations \n \u2022 Off-Balance Sheet Financing \n \u2022 Application of Critical Accounting Estimates \n \u2022 Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nAmerican Media, Inc. together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Company\", \"AMI\", \"we\", \"our\" or \"us\") is one of the largest publishers of celebrity and health and active lifestyle magazines in the United States, with a diversified portfolio of 10 publications that have a combined monthly print and digital audience of more than 39 million readers and monthly on-line audience of approximately 49 million readers.\nIn August 2014, American Media, Inc. entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with AMI Parent Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the \"Parent\"), which is controlled by certain investors of AMI (collectively, the \"Investors\"), and AMI Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the \"Merger Sub\"), whereby the Merger Sub was merged with and into American Media, Inc. (the \"Merger\") with American Media, Inc. surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent. As a result of the Merger, the Parent acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of American Media, Inc.\nIn January 2015, we sold our Shape, Fit Pregnancy and Natural Health publications, which comprised our Women's Active Lifestyle segment, for approximately $60 million in cash plus an earnout of up to $60 million. As a result, the operations of the Women's Active Lifestyle segment have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. After giving effect to the divestiture of our Women's Active Lifestyle segment, we report under a new segment structure beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and accordingly have recast prior period segment amounts.\nOur remaining well-known publications cover two primary operating segments: Celebrity and Men's Active Lifestyle. Within our Celebrity segment, our portfolio of brands includes: National Enquirer, Star, OK!, Globe, National Examiner and Soap Opera Digest. Within our Men's Active Lifestyle segment, our portfolio of brands include: Men's Fitness, Muscle & Fitness, Muscle & Fitness Hers and Flex. Our third, non-operating segment, Corporate and Other, includes our international licensing of certain health and fitness publications, photo syndication for all our media content platforms and strategic management services for publishers.\nWe believe our leadership position in these segments provides us with strong competitive advantages in the publishing market. Our iconic brands have enabled us to build a loyal readership and establish relationships with major advertisers and distributors. We have leveraged the strength of our portfolio of brands through joint ventures, licensing opportunities, and strategic relationships with several national retailers. We believe the combination of our well-known brands, established relationship with advertisers and distributors, and ability to leverage our brands with major retailers and to monetize content across multiple platforms creates a competitive position that is difficult to replicate.\nOur largest revenue stream comes from single copy newsstand sales. Our second largest revenue stream comes from multi-platform advertising. Our primary operating expenses consist of production, distribution, circulation and other cost of sales, as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. We incur most of our operating expenses during the production of our printed magazines, which includes costs for printing and paper. Paper is the principal raw material utilized in our publications. We have a long-term paper supply and purchasing agreement with the largest paper supply broker in the United States which manages all aspects of our raw material paper inventory. The price of paper is driven by market conditions and therefore difficult to predict. Changes in paper prices could significantly affect our business.\nWe are experiencing declines in our circulation revenue and print advertising as a result of market conditions in the magazine publishing industry. These declines are primarily caused by the disruption in our wholesaler distribution channel, the overall decline in the celebrity newsstand market and the decline in the consumer advertising market coupled with the shift in advertising dollars from print to digital. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and current events. Since magazines are generally discretionary purchases for consumers, our circulation revenues are sensitive to economic downturns. Adverse changes in the markets we serve generally result in reductions in revenue as a result of lower consumer spending, which can lead to a reduction in advertising revenue.\nOur fiscal year ended on March 31, 2016 and is referred to herein as fiscal 2016. References to our fiscal year (e.g. \"fiscal 2016\") refer to our fiscal year ended March 31st of the applicable year.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND MANAGEMENT ACTION PLANS\nRecent Developments\nDigital Initiatives\nWe conduct our advertising sales through a combination of corporate and brand sales and marketing teams that sell advertising across multiple media platforms. Our salespeople are divided into specific brand teams, with each team focusing on selling marketing programs that integrate print, digital (such as mobile and desktop), social media and events for our clients. We are also the industry leader in creating sponsored content and native advertising. Combined, our sales teams cover all consumer advertising categories.\nWe have launched digital editions for all our brands on the following platforms: Next Issue Media, Apple, Google newsstand, Zinio, Amazon Kindle and Barnes & Noble's Nook. During fiscal 2016, our digital advertising revenue increased 40% over the comparable prior year period.\nPrint Initiatives\nThe relaunch of Men's Fitness continues to attract new luxury goods advertisers including Ralph Lauren, FIJI Water, Louis Vuitton, Nautica, Energizer and SlimFast. During fiscal 2016, total advertising revenues increased 9% for Men's Fitness as compared to the prior period.\nRelated Operations\nOver the past year, we have developed several unique brand extensions across multiple platforms.\nIn February 2016, we announced a partnership with Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson's company, Seven Bucks Productions. Mr. Johnson is one of the world's biggest box office stars with over $1.4 billion in ticket sales in 2015 and Seven Bucks Productions has over 50 movie, television and digital projects in development. Our initial venture will be a live television broadcast of the Mr. Olympia event from Las Vegas in September 2016. Mr. Johnson will be one of the co-hosts and we are currently in negotiations with a leading broadcast network to air the live broadcast of the Mr. Olympia event.\nWe currently publish a custom magazine for GNC Holdings, Inc. (\"GNC\") on a quarterly basis, utilizing our Men's Fitness (and Shape pursuant to a license agreement) brands. The print version is distributed to approximately 500,000 customers through select GNC stores, with another 1 million digital copies distributed via email to GNC's database of customers. GNC leverages its vendors to advertise in the magazine and AMI retains 100% of the advertising revenues.\nThe REELZ Channel, available in 68 million homes, recently premiered a new television series, National Enquirer Investigates and the Discovery Channel will launch a series called Enquiring Minds this fall. We are partnering with The Weinstein Company on both of these televisions series. There is also a feature film and documentary drama television series on The National Enquirer in development with IMG/WME.\nDebt Related Transactions\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2016, AMI repurchased $2.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 11.5% per annum and mature in December 2017 (the \"First Lien Notes\"), plus accrued and unpaid interest in the open market, from the Investors.\nIn February 2016, we amended the revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\") to, among other things, extend the maturity date to June 2017, modify the financial covenants in effect through the date of maturity and provide for certain other provisions.\nIn March 2016, AMI exchanged approximately $58.9 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, held by the Investors, for approximately $76.0 million aggregate principal amount of new second lien senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 7.0% per annum and mature in July 2020 (the \"New Second Lien Notes\"), pursuant to an exchange agreement (the \"New Second Lien Notes Exchange Agreement\").\nIn addition to the New Second Lien Notes Exchange Agreement, AMI also issued, in March 2016, approximately $76.2 million in aggregate principal amount of New Second Lien Notes in a distribution to holders of equity interests in the Parent, of which approximately $68.8 million was issued to the Investors and approximately $7.4 million was issued to AMI's Chief Executive Officer (the \"Officer\"), and approximately $7.3 million aggregate principal amount of New Second Lien Notes were issued to an affiliate of the Investors in exchange for cash.\nIn March 2016, AMI repurchased the remaining $2.2 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 13.5% per annum and mature in June 2018 (the \"Second Lien Notes\"), plus accrued and unpaid interest in the open market. Upon the full satisfaction and cancellation of all outstanding Second Lien Notes, the collateral agreement securing the Second Lien Notes was terminated and AMI's obligations under the Indenture governing the Second Lien Notes were satisfied in full.\nSee \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Secured Notes\" within this Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" for a further discussion regarding our debt agreements.\nWholesaler Transition\nSeveral of our wholesalers, including our former second-largest wholesaler, Source Interlink Companies (\"Source\"), ceased operation during 2014. Since then we have transitioned the previous wholesalers' newsstand distribution (approximately 25% of the market) to the two remaining major wholesalers. This transition had an immediate adverse impact on single copy newsstand sales and liquidity during fiscal 2015 and into the first half of fiscal 2016.\nManagement Action Plans for Cost Savings\nDuring fiscal 2016, we developed and implemented management action plans that resulted in $18.4 million of cost savings in fiscal 2016 and that we expect will result in approximately $6.8 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017 (the \"2016 and 2017 Management Action Plans\"). These expense reductions were primarily from outsourcing technology and operating functions, digital content re-negotiations, print order efficiencies and editorial and advertising sales staff consolidations. We will realize the benefits from the 2016 and 2017 Management Action Plans during fiscal 2016 and beyond.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we developed and implemented management action plans that resulted in $6.6 million of cost savings in fiscal 2016 and $6.4 million of cost savings in fiscal 2015 (the \"2016 and 2015 Management Action Plans\"). These expense reductions were primarily from outsourcing technology and operating functions, digital content re-negotiations, and editorial and advertising sales expense reductions. We realized the benefits from the 2016 and 2015 Management Action Plans in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 and certain of these costs savings may benefit fiscal 2017 and beyond.\nReference to Management Action Plans refers to the 2016 and 2017 Management Action Plans and the 2016 and 2015 Management Action Plans.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides a summary of our operating results

primarily due to reduced circulation ($23.4 million), partially offset by increased advertising ($0.9 million) and other revenues ($0.3 million).\nCirculation revenue has declined due to the overall decline in the celebrity newsstand magazine market, coupled with the planned discontinuance of our special interest publications ($2.5 million) and certain foreign editions of Muscle & Fitness and Flex ($1.9 million), and the sale of our Country Weekly publication ($2.8 million). The increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to digital. Other revenue increased primarily due to the elimination of joint venture losses recognized in prior years coupled with the increase in revenue from the Mr. Olympia event, partially offset by reduced publishing services revenue.\nTotal operating revenue decreased $42.2 million during fiscal 2015 primarily due to reduced circulation ($21.4 million), advertising ($5.7 million) and other revenues ($15.1 million).\nCirculation revenue declined due to the industry-wide disruption in our wholesaler channel coupled with the decline in the celebrity newsstand magazine market. Advertising revenue declined due to the 11% decline in the consumer advertising market. The decline in other revenue was due to the divestiture of our distribution and merchandising business (DSI) in September 2013 ($5.2 million), coupled with an unfavorable timing of certain non-recurring revenue streams ($8.2 million), partially offset by higher revenue from the Mr. Olympia event ($1.3 million).\nThe following table summarizes our operating revenues, by type, as a percentage of total operating revenues:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal years ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Circulation\n</td> <td>64%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising\n</td> <td>31%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCirculation Revenue\nOur circulation revenue was generated from the following components for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal years ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single Copy\n</td> <td>78%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription\n</td> <td>22%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur circulation revenue, representing the sale of magazines to consumers, generates more than half of our total revenues and is an important component in determining our advertising revenues because advertising rates are dependent on circulation and audience. Single copy sales (also known as newsstand sales) are sold primarily through national distributors, wholesalers and retailers. Subscriptions are sold primarily through direct mail, or digitally via the Internet. Additionally, digital-only subscriptions and single-copy digital issues of our magazines are sold or distributed through various app stores and other digital storefronts. Our digital subscriptions represent 15% of our 2.0 million net subscriptions as of March 31, 2016, the highest percentage among our competitive set.\nCirculation revenue declined $23.4 million during fiscal 2016 due to the overall reduction in the celebrity magazine sector ($14.1 million) coupled with the planned discontinuance of our special interest publications ($2.5 million) and certain foreign editions of Muscle & Fitness and Flex ($1.9 million), and the sale of our Country Weekly publication ($2.8 million). During fiscal 2015, circulation revenue declined $21.4 million primarily due to the wholesaler transition ($16.6 million) coupled with the sale of our Country Weekly publication ($2.5 million).\nAdvertising Revenue\nOur advertising revenue was generated from the following components for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal years ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Print\n</td> <td>80%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Digital\n</td> <td>20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe sale of advertising across our multiple platforms generates approximately one-third of our total revenues. Print advertising revenue continues to be negatively impacted by the decline in the consumer magazine sector coupled with the transformation of advertising from print to digital.\nWe conduct our advertising sales through a combination of corporate and brand sales and marketing teams that sell advertising across multiple media platforms. Our salespeople are divided into specific brand teams, with each team focusing on selling marketing programs that integrate print, digital (such as mobile and desktop), social media and events for our clients. We are also the industry leader in creating sponsored content and native advertising. Combined, our sales teams cover all consumer advertising categories.\nThe rates at which we sell print advertising depend on each magazine's rate base, which is the circulation of the magazine that we guarantee to our advertisers, as well as our audience size. If we are not able to meet our committed rate base, the price paid by advertisers is generally subject to downward adjustments, including in the form of future credits or discounts. Our published rates for each of our magazines are subject to negotiation with each of our advertisers.\nAdvertising revenue increased $0.9 million during fiscal 2016 due to higher digital advertising ($4.1 million), partially offset by the decline in print advertising ($0.4 million) and the planned discontinuance of certain foreign editions of Muscle & Fitness and Flex ($2.3 million) and the sale of Country Weekly ($0.5 million). During fiscal 2015, advertising revenue decreased $5.7 million due to lower print advertising revenue ($7.7 million), partially offset by higher digital advertising ($2.0 million).\nOther Revenue\nOur other revenue represented 5% of our operating revenues during fiscal 2016 and 2015 and10% during fiscal 2014.\nDuring fiscal 2016, other revenue increased $0.3 million due to the timing of certain non-recurring streams, partially offset by the reduction in publishing services.\nOther revenues decreased $15.1 million during fiscal 2015 primarily due to the divestiture of our distribution and merchandising company (DSI) in September 2013 ($5.2 million) coupled with an unfavorable timing of certain non-recurring revenue streams ($8.2 million), partially offset by the increased revenue from the Mr. Olympia event ($1.3 million).\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses are comprised of the following for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal years ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>Percent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs of revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Production\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Editorial\n</td> <td>24.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution, circulation and other\n</td> <td>36.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs of revenues:\n</td> <td>115.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(14\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>55.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(36\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>26.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>197.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(53.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* - Represents an increase or decrease in excess of 100%.\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues consist of costs related to the production of our printed magazines, editorial costs, as well as other expenses.\nOur production costs, including paper and printing costs, accounted for approximately 28%, 26% and 30%, respectively, of our total operating expenses for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. Paper is the principal raw material utilized in our publications and we have a long-term paper supply and purchasing agreement with the largest paper supply broker in the United States.\nEditorial costs include costs associated with manuscripts, photographs and related salaries and accounted for approximately 13%, 11% and 12%, respectively for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nOur distribution, circulation and other expenses consist primarily of postage and freight for shipment to our wholesalers and fulfillment companies and accounted for approximately 18%, 16% and 18%, respectively, of our total operating expenses for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. We are subject to postal rate increases that affect delivery costs and effective May 31, 2015, rates for all classes of mail were increased by approximately 2% by the Postal Regulation Commission.\nTotal costs of revenues decreased during fiscal 2016 and 2015 due to the Management Action Plans in the following areas: $11.8 million in production, $1.9 million in editorial and $2.8 million in distribution and circulation for fiscal 2016 and a reduction of $9.6 million in production, $4.1 million in editorial and $7.0 million in distribution and circulation for fiscal 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative costs decreased $31.2 million during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the Management Action Plans for employee-related expenses ($12.2 million), as well as reduced wholesaler-related bad debt expense ($8.4 million), accounting and legal fees ($1.6 million), other non-recurring expenses ($3.5 million) and costs associated with restructuring ($1.5 million).\nDuring fiscal 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $8.3 million as compared to the prior year periods primarily due the Merger and related transactions ($4.8 million), bad debt expense due to the wholesaler bankruptcy ($3.3 million), costs associated with restructuring ($1.5 million) and the timing of gains from insurance settlement recognized in the prior comparable period ($1.4 million), partially offset by the divestiture of our distribution and merchandising company (DSI) in September 2013 ($2.1 million).\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses, which are non-cash, increased $12.5 million and $0.5 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to the reclassification of certain tradenames from indefinite-lived to finite-lived.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThere were no impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2016.\nDuring an evaluation of goodwill and other identified intangible assets during fiscal 2015 and 2014, we determined that indicators were present in certain reporting units that would suggest the fair value of the reporting unit may have declined below the carrying value. This decline was primarily the result of the near-term advertising revenue shortfall coupled with the continued softness in the print publication industry overall, which resulted in lowered future cash flow projections.\nAs a result, an impairment test of goodwill and identified intangible assets was performed for certain reporting units. The evaluation resulted in the carrying value of goodwill and tradenames for certain reporting units to exceed the fair value. As a result, the Company recorded pre-tax non-cash impairment charge totaling $18.5 million for goodwill and tradenames during fiscal 2015 and $9.2 million for tradenames during fiscal 2014, respectively.\nNon-Operating Items\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $11.2 million and $7.5 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, when compared to the prior year period due to the exchange, in March 2016 and January 2015, of certain senior secured notes.\nAmortization of Deferred Financing Costs\nAmortization of deferred financing costs remained consistent during fiscal 2016 and increased $2.3 million during fiscal 2015, when compared to the prior year period due to the exchange, in March 2016 and January 2015, of certain senior secured notes.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $36.0 million and $15.7 million and during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance. This was a direct result of the reclassification of certain tradenames from indefinite lived to finite lived effective October 1, 2014 and April 1, 2015.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to American Media, Inc.\nThe $17.0 million of net income attributable to American Media, Inc. for fiscal 2016 represents a $44.1 million improvement from the comparable prior year period. This improvement is primarily attributable to the $31.5 million increase in operating income, the $20.3 million increase in benefit for income taxes coupled with the $11.2 million decrease in interest expense, partially offset by the $15.3 million decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax and the $3.7 million decrease in other income.\nThe $27.1 million of net loss attributable to American Media, Inc. for fiscal 2015 represents a $27.2 million improvement from the comparable prior year period. This improvement is primarily attributable to the $46.3 million decrease in provision for income taxes, the $11.6 million increase in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, and the $7.5 million decrease in interest expense, partially offset by the $39.6 million decrease in operating income.\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\nOur operating segments consist of: Celebrity Brands, Men's Active Lifestyle and Corporate and Other. After the divestiture of our Women's Active Lifestyle segment, we report under a new segment structure beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Given this change, we have restated prior period segment information to correspond to the current reporting structure. This structure is organized according to the markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing the best content to a wide range of consumers.\nOur operating segments consist of the following brands in print and digital, as of March 31, 2016:\nCelebrity Brands Segment\n \u2022 National Enquirer, a weekly, hard news, investigating tabloid covering all celebrities, politics, crime, human interest, health and fashion. We recently appointed Dick Morris as the chief political commentator and contributor to expand our political coverage; \n \u2022 Star, a weekly, celebrity-focused, news-based, glossy magazine covering movie, television and reality stars and music celebrities. Star's editorial content includes fashion, beauty, accessories and health sections; \n \u2022 OK!, a younger weekly, celebrity-friendly, news-based, glossy magazine covering the stars of movies, television, reality and music. OK!'s editorial content has fashion, beauty and accessories sections; OKMagazine.com differentiates itself through its use of online communities and social media to encourage a dialog between users, including their editorial point of view; \n \u2022 Globe, a weekly tabloid that focuses on older movie and television celebrities, the royal family, political scandals and investigative crime stories that are less mainstream and more salacious than the National Enquirer; \n \u2022 National Examiner, a weekly tabloid (currently available only in print format) consisting of celebrity and human interest stories, differentiating it from the other titles through its upbeat positioning as the source for gossip, contests, women's service and good news for an older tabloid audience; and \n \u2022 Soap Opera Digest, a weekly magazine that provides behind-the-scenes scoops and breaking news to passionate soap opera fans every week; SoapOperaDigest.com is a companion site that mirrors the magazine's editorial point of view. \nMen's Active Lifestyle Segment\n \u2022 Men's Fitness, an active lifestyle magazine for men 18-34 years old, which positions fitness as the new measure of success, as reflected in its editorial coverage of men's fashion, grooming, automotive, finance, travel and other lifestyle categories; Men's Fitness is also home to the latest in exercise techniques, sports training, nutrition and health; Men'sFitness.com provides everything for every man in terms of a healthy and fit lifestyle; \n \u2022 Muscle & Fitness, a fitness physique training magazine appealing to exercise enthusiasts and athletes of all ages, especially those focused on resistance training, body fat control, sports nutrition and supplements; MuscleandFitness.com provides workout videos and nutritional advice; \n \u2022 Flex, a magazine devoted to professional bodybuilding featuring nutrition, supplement and performance science content for bodybuilding enthusiasts and coverage of all professional and amateur bodybuilding contests; Flexonline.com features online coverage of all the major bodybuilding competitions, as well as training videos with today's top bodybuilders; \n \u2022 Muscle & Fitness Hers, a fitness physique training magazine designed for active women who want more out of fitness, especially those who work extra hard to achieve a \"super-fit\" lifestyle, and covers training, nutrition, health, beauty and fashion for today's women; \n \u2022 Mr. Olympia, a four-day event held annually in September in Las Vegas attracting more than 50,000 fans of bodybuilding and fitness experts from around the world; includes a two-day health and fitness exposition with 340 exhibitors including physical exercise challenges and merchandising opportunities that culminates with the world's most prestigious and largest event in bodybuilding and fitness, the Mr. Olympia contest; and \n \u2022 Weider UK, a wholly-owned subsidiary, publishes Muscle & Fitness and Flex in the United Kingdom, France and Germany and licenses the content in Holland and Australia. Each market edition is in a local language with local content and has its own website. \nCorporate and Other Segment\nThis segment includes revenues from international licensing of certain health and fitness publications, photo syndication for all our media content platforms and strategic management services for publishers, including back-office functions. Corporate overhead expenses are not allocated to other segments and are as follows: corporate executives, production, circulation, information technology, accounting, legal, human resources, business development and administrative department costs.\nFinancial Information Regarding Our Operating Segments\nWe use operating income (loss) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments and present operating income (loss) before impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, if any, to provide a consistent and comparable measure of our performance between periods. Management uses operating income (loss) before impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, if any, when communicating financial results to the board of directors, stockholders, debt holders and investors as well as when determining performance goals for executive compensation. Management believes this non-GAAP measure, although not a substitute for GAAP, improves comparability. Management also believes our stockholders, debt holders and investors use this measure as a gauge to assess the performance of their investment in the Company.\nWe prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. Our calculations of operating income (loss) herein may be different from the calculations used by other companies, therefore comparability may be limited.

The pre-tax non-cash impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets was $18.5 million and $9.2 million, respectively during fiscal 2015 and 2014, and impacted the Men's Active Lifestyle segment goodwill and tradenames. The pre-tax non-cash impairment charges were primarily the result of the near-term advertising revenue shortfall coupled with the continued softness in the print publication industry overall, which resulted in lowered future cash flow projections. See the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report, specifically Note 3, \"Goodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets.\"\nCelebrity Brands Segment\nThe Celebrity Brands segment comprised 74%, 73% and 71% our total operating revenues for fiscal 2016, 2015 for fiscal 2014, respectively.\nOperating Revenues\nTotal operating revenues in the Celebrity Brands segment were $164.4 million for fiscal 2016, representing a decrease of $15.5 million, or 9%, over the comparable prior year period. For our continuing publications, total operating revenues declined $10.1 million, or 6%. Circulation revenue declined $14.1 million, or 10%, due to a reduction in the celebrity newsstand market of 12%. This was partially offset by the 11% increase in advertising revenue ($3.0 million) from National Enquirer, OK! and Star, which is counterintuitive to the consumer advertising market, which was down 10%. Total operating revenues were further impacted by the planned discontinuance of our special interest publications ($2.5 million) and the sale of Country Weekly ($2.8 million).\nDuring fiscal 2015, total operating revenues in the Celebrity Brands segment were $179.8 million, representing a decrease of $22.8 million, or 11%, over the comparable prior year period. For our continuing publications, total operating revenues declined $19.2 million, or 10%. Circulation revenue declined $16.6 million, or 10%, due to a reduction in the celebrity newsstand sales primarily due to the industry-wide newsstand distribution disruption, coupled with the 6% decline in advertising revenue ($1.7 million) due to the 11% decline in the consumer magazine sector. Total operating revenues were further impacted by the planned discontinuance of our special interest publications ($0.8 million) and the sale of Country Weekly ($2.5 million).\nOperating Income\nThe Celebrity Brands segment operating income before impairment decreased $13.8 million, or 20%, to $54.1 million during fiscal 2016. This decline was due to the revenue declines previously discussed coupled with an increase in amortization expenses ($11.3 million) related to the reclassification of certain tradenames from indefinite-lived intangibles to finite-lives of 15 years, effective April 1, 2015. These declines are partially offset by the planned reduction in expenses ($13.1 million) pursuant to our Management Action Plans.\nOperating income before impairment in the Celebrity Brands segment decreased during fiscal 2015 from prior year by $5.4 million, or 7%, to $67.9 million. This decline was due to the revenue declines mentioned above, partially offset by the planned reduction in expenses ($17.4 million) pursuant to our Management Action Plans.\nMen's Active Lifestyle Segment\nThe Men's Active Lifestyle segment represented 25%, 24% and 23% of our consolidated operating revenues for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOperating Revenues\nTotal operating revenues in the Men's Active Lifestyle segment were $55.6 million during fiscal 2016, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 6%, over the comparable prior year period. This decline was due to the discontinuance of certain foreign editions of Muscle & Fitness and Flex ($4.9 million) coupled with the decline in print advertising ($1.1 million). These declines were partially offset by the increase in digital advertising revenue ($2.0 million), primarily from Men's Fitness ($1.1 million) and Muscle & Fitness ($0.9 million) due to a 17% and 11% increase in page views, respectively, coupled with the increase in revenue from the Mr. Olympia event ($0.8 million or 12%).\nDuring fiscal 2015, total operating revenues in the Men's Active Lifestyle segment were $59.2 million, a decrease $7.5 million, or 11%, over the comparable prior year period. The decline in circulation revenue ($2.6 million) and print advertising revenue ($7.1 million) was primarily due to the reduction in the publishing frequency of Muscle & Fitness and Flex, from twelve times per year to ten times per year (or two less issues) during fiscal 2015. Print advertising revenue has also been negatively impacted during fiscal 2015 by a major advertiser who shifted their entire advertising budget ($4.0 million) from print to digital and social advertising platform investments outside the Men's Active Lifestyle category. A portion of this advertising business did return to the Men's Active Lifestyle segment during fiscal 2016. These declines were partially offset by the increase in digital advertising revenue ($1.3 million), which is directly attributable to the relaunch and repositioning of Men's Fitness, and the increased revenues from the Mr. Olympia event ($1.3 million, or 26%).\nOperating Income\nThe Men's Active Lifestyle segment operating income before impairment increased $1.6 million, or 13% to $13.1 million during fiscal 2016. Our planned Management Action Plans reduced expenses by $6.5 million, which was partially offset by an increase in amortization expense ($1.4 million) related to certain tradenames as discussed above coupled with the revenue decline previously mentioned.\nOperating income before impairment in the Men's Active Lifestyle segment declined during fiscal 2015 from the prior year by $9.4 million, or 45%, to $11.6 million. This decline is due to the reasons mentioned above coupled with an increase in amortization expense related to the classification of certain tradenames ($1.5 million).\nCorporate and Other Segment\nThe Corporate and Other segment was 1%, 3% and 6% of our consolidated operating revenues for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOperating Revenues\nTotal operating revenues in the Corporate and Other segment were $3.1 million during fiscal 2016, a decline of $3.1 million, or 50%, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the planned reduction in publishing services ($1.3 million) and books publishing ($0.3 million).\nDuring fiscal 2015, total operating revenues in the Corporate and Other segment were $6.1 million, a decrease of $11.9 million, or 66%, from the prior year. This decline was attributable to the divestiture of our distribution and merchandising company in September 2013 ($5.2 million), the timing of the custom video projects for Microsoft ($4.7 million) and the cessation of certain publishing services ($2.3 million).\nOperating Loss\nTotal operating loss before impairment decreased by $25.3 million, or 38%, to $41.5 million during fiscal 2016, compared to the prior year period. This improvement was attributable to the Management Action Plans for employee-related expenses ($11.3 million), as well as reduced wholesaler bad debt expenses ($7.3 million), accounting and legal fees ($1.3 million) and the other non-recurring expenses ($3.5 million), partially offset by the $3.1 million decline in operating revenue previously discussed.\nDuring fiscal 2015, total operating loss before impairment increased by $15.6 million, or 30%, to $66.8 million. This increase was attributable to the $11.9 million decline in operating revenue coupled with a $3.6 million increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the bad debt expense related to the wholesaler shutdowns ($3.3 million) and the costs incurred for the Merger and other related transactions ($3.4 million), coupled with the timing of the gains on insurance settlement recognized in the prior comparable period ($1.4 million). These expense increases were partially offset by the $5.2 million decrease in operating expenses related to the divestiture of our distribution and merchandising business.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nManagement's Assessment of Liquidity\nOur operations have historically generated positive net cash flow from operating activities. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from operations, amounts available under our revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\") and cash interest savings from our recent debt initiatives.\nOur principal uses of cash that affect our liquidity include operational expenditures and debt service costs, including interest payments on and repurchases of our senior secured notes. In addition to the dispositions discussed elsewhere, we expect to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. These transactions, if consummated, could be material and may involve cash or the issuance of additional senior secured notes.\nAs of March 31, 2016, the Company had $1.4 million of cash, $15.4 million available pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility and a working capital deficit of $32.7 million, of which approximately $26.6 million relates to deferred revenues. In February 2016, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date to June 2017 and modify the financial covenants in effect through the date of maturity.\nIn addition to outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, as of March 31, 2016, there was $378.7 million principal amount of outstanding senior secured debt. Over the next year, the cash interest payments due under these debt agreements are approximately $40.2 million and there are no scheduled principal payments due.\nWe expect that our current cash balances, cash generated from operating activities, availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, and the cash interest savings from the recent debt initiatives should be sufficient to meet working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other cash needs for the next year.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences for the business and operations. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" included in this Annual Report, specifically, \"Our substantial indebtedness and our ability to incur additional indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and result of operations.\"\nWholesaler Transition\nSeveral of our wholesalers, including our former second-largest wholesaler, Source Interlink Companies (\"Source\"), ceased operation during 2014. Since then we have transitioned the previous wholesalers' newsstand distribution (approximately 25% of the market) to the two remaining major wholesalers. This transition had an immediate adverse impact on single copy newsstand sales and liquidity during fiscal 2015 and into the first half of fiscal 2016. We are beginning to see a stabilization in the newsstand sales, and the wholesale supply chain currently and primarily consists of two private companies, owned by billionaires, that have been in the business for decades.\nThere can be no assurances that our revenue will not be temporarily or permanently reduced if consumers at the impacted retailers do not resume purchasing our publications at the same rate or quantities previously purchased. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" included in this Annual Report, specifically, \"Our circulation revenue consists of single copy sales distributed to retailers primarily by two wholesalers and the loss of either of these wholesalers could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\"\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following information has been derived from the accompanying consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2.1 million during fiscal 2016 and increased $0.4 million during fiscal 2015. The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal years ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs. 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(25.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(53.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in operating assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>55.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(67.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effects of exchange rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by our non-cash items, changes in working capital and the impact of our results of operations. Non-cash items consist primarily of the provision (benefit) for deferred income taxes, depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred financing costs and deferred rack costs and provisions for doubtful accounts.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 million and $12.7 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decline of $9.2 million, primarily due to the $30.9 million net decrease in non-cash items coupled with the $22.2 million net change in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by the $43.9 million increase in our results of operations.\nNon-cash items decreased primarily due to the decrease in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $18.5 million, the decrease in provision for doubtful accounts of $8.7 million, the decrease in non-cash payment-in-kind interest accretion of $4.8 million for certain senior secured notes, the increase in benefit for income taxes of $3.9 million and the decrease in the loss on sale of assets of $2.5 million, partially offset by the increase in depreciation and amortization of $11.6 million.\nThe net change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to the $35.6 million net change in accounts payable and accrued expenses,\nthe $10.3 million net change in inventories resulting from our agreement to outsource paper purchases and the $4.3 million net change in prepaid expenses, partially offset by the $20.6 million net change in trade receivables, the net change in deferred revenue of $3.8 million, the net change in accrued interest of $3.4 million and the net change in deferred rack costs of $2.7 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $2.9 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the $27.4 million increase in our results of operations coupled with the $16.0 million net change in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by the $40.5 million net increase in non-cash items.\nNon-cash items decreased primarily due to the decrease in provision for income taxes of $64.7 million, partially offset by the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $9.2 million, the increase in provision for doubtful accounts of $3.4 million, the loss on sale of assets of $2.5 million, the increase in non-cash payment-in-kind interest accretion of $2.9 million for certain senior secured notes and the net decrease in amortization of deferred rack and deferred financing costs of $1.6 million.\nThe net change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to the $7.6 million net change in inventories resulting from our agreement to outsource paper purchases, the $6.7 million net change in prepaid expenses, the $3.6 million net change in accounts payable and accrued expenses, the $3.4 million net change in trade receivables, partially offset by the net change in deferred revenue of $2.7 million and the net change in accrued interest of $2.2 million.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.7 million for fiscal 2016, a decrease of $58.3 million, compared to $55.7 million of net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to the $63.0 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets and the $2.6 million decrease in proceeds from affiliates, partially offset by the $7.2 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment and intangibles assets.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $55.7 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $74.5 million compared to $18.8 million of net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to the $63.0 million in proceeds from the sale of assets and the $2.6 million in proceeds from affiliates coupled with the $2.5 million decrease in investment in affiliates plus the $6.2 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2016 was $2.6 million, a decrease of $64.6 million, compared to $67.2 million of net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to the $53.7 million decrease in repurchases of certain senior secured notes, the $14.8 million decrease in net borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the $4.3 million decrease in costs incurred in the restructuring, partially offset by the $5.5 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of certain senior secured notes and the $2.3 million increase in deferred financing costs.\nNet cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2015 was $67.2 million, an increase of $76.7 million, compared to $9.5 million of net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to the $55.8 million increase in repurchases of certain senior secured notes, the $31.3 million decrease in net borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by the $12.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of certain senior secured notes and the $4.0 million decrease in payments for the redemption of Odyssey preferred stock.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Senior Secured Notes\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe maintain a revolving credit facility that provides for borrowing up to $35.0 million, less outstanding letters of credit, which matures in June 2017 (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"). The Investors became a lending party to the Revolving Credit Facility during fiscal 2015 and represent a commitment of approximately 42% of the Revolving Credit Facility. See \"Revolving Credit Facility Amendments\" below for additional historical information.\nWe have the option to pay interest based on (i) a floating base rate option equal to the greatest of (x) the prime rate in effect on such day; (y) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus \u00bd of 1%; and (z) one month LIBOR (but no less than 2%) plus 1%, or (ii) LIBOR, in each case, plus a margin. The interest rate under the Revolving Credit Facility has ranged from 8.00% to 8.50% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.50% to 0.75% on the unused portion of the revolving commitment. Commitment fees paid during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were insignificant.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we borrowed $72.7 million and repaid $72.2 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. At March 31, 2016, the available borrowing capacity is $15.4 million, after considering the $15.2 million outstanding balance and the $4.4 million outstanding letter of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility is included in non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements based on the June 2017 maturity date.\nThe indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain of the domestic subsidiaries of the Company and is secured by liens on substantially all the assets of the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries. In addition, the Company's obligations are secured by a pledge of all the issued and outstanding shares of, or other equity interests in, certain of the Company's existing or subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries and a percentage of the capital stock of, or other equity interests in, certain of its existing or subsequently acquired or organized foreign subsidiaries.\nCovenants\nThe Revolving Credit Facility includes certain representations and warranties, conditions precedent, affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants include financial maintenance covenants comprised of a first lien leverage ratio, a consolidated leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict paying dividends, incurring additional indebtedness, creating liens, making acquisitions or other investments, entering into certain mergers or consolidations and selling or otherwise disposing of assets. With respect to the dividend restrictions, there is a cap on the total amount of cash available for distribution to our common stockholders.\nWith regard to the financial maintenance covenants, the first lien leverage ratio covenant must be equal to or less than 3.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017. The consolidated leverage ratio covenant must be equal to or less than 5.50 to 1.00 from October 1, 2015 through June 2017. The interest coverage ratio must be equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nAlthough there can be no assurances, management believes that, based on current projections (including projected borrowings and repayments under the Revolving Credit Facility), its operating results for fiscal 2017 will be sufficient to satisfy the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company's ability to satisfy the financial covenants is dependent on the business performing in accordance with its projections. If the performance of the Company's business deviates significantly from its projections, the Company may not be able to satisfy such financial covenants. The Company's projections are subject to a number of factors, many of which are events beyond its control, which could cause its actual results to differ materially from its projections. If the Company does not comply with its financial covenants, the Company will be in default under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nRevolving Credit Facility Amendments\nIn December 2010, we entered into a revolving credit facility with an original maturity date of December 2015 with a commitment for borrowing up to $40.0 million, less outstanding letters of credit. In February 2015, we amended and restated the revolving credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date to December 2016, reduce the borrowing capacity from $40.0 million to $35.0 million and amend the first lien leverage ratio and certain other covenants and provisions.\nIn February 2016, the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent\u201d), and the lenders from time to time party to the Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, restated, modified or supplemented from time to time, entered into the first amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility with the lenders (the Consenting Lenders\u201d) constituting the Required Lenders (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) to, among other things, extend the maturity date to June 2017, modify the financial covenants in effect through the date of maturity, and provide for certain other provisions.\nWith regard to the financial covenants, the first lien leverage ratio covenant must be equal to or less than 4.25 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017, provided that the first lien leverage ratio covenant will be lowered to 4.00 to 1.00 if the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company's first lien notes is less than $250 million. The consolidated leverage ratio covenant must be equal to or less than 5.25 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017, provided that the consolidated leverage ratio covenant will be lowered to 5.00 to 1.00 if the outstanding principal amount of the Company's first lien notes is less than $250 million. The interest coverage ratio was not amended and must be equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017.\nIn March 2016, the Company, the Administrative Agent and the lenders from time to time party to the Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, restated, modified or supplemented from time to time, entered into the second amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility with the Consenting Lenders constituting the Required Lenders to, among other things, allow for the issuance of additional indebtedness, modify the financial covenants in effect through the date of maturity, and provide for certain other provisions.\nWith regard to the financial covenants, the first lien leverage ratio covenant must be equal to or less than 3.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017 and the provision to lower the first lien leverage ratio based on the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company's first lien notes was removed in its entirety. The consolidated leverage ratio must be equal to or less than 5.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017 and the provision to lower the consolidated leverage ratio based on the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company's first lien notes was removed in its entirety. The interest coverage ratio was not amended and must be equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017.\nSenior Secured Notes\nOur senior secured notes may be comprised of the first lien notes, the second lien notes, the new second lien notes and the second lien PIK notes and are collectively referred to herein as the \"Senior Secured Notes.\" See \"Supplemental Indentures\" below for a discussion of the amendments to the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes.\nFirst Lien Notes\nIn December 2010, we issued $385.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 11.5% per annum, payable semi-annually, and mature in December 2017 (the \"First Lien Notes\").\nDuring fiscal 2012, we redeemed $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately $2.3 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes in the open market, from the Investors. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased $55.5 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes in the open market, from the Investors. We also exchanged $32.0 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes held by the Investors, for approximately $39.0 million aggregate principal amount of new second lien senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 7.0% per annum and mature in July 2020 (the \"New Second Lien Notes\"), pursuant to an exchange agreement.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we repurchased $2.0 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes, at a price equal to 105.9% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest in the open market, from the Investors. In March 2016, we exchanged approximately $58.9 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, held by the Investors, for approximately $76.0 million in aggregate principal amount of New Second Lien Notes, pursuant to an exchange agreement (the \"New Second Lien Notes Exchange Agreement\"), as further described below.\nAt March 31, 2016, the First Lien Notes represented an aggregate of $214.3 million of our indebtedness.\nThe First Lien Notes are guaranteed on a first lien senior secured basis by the same subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility. The First Lien Notes and the guarantees thereof are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all our assets (subject to certain permitted liens and exceptions), pari passu with the liens granted under our Revolving Credit Facility, provided that in the event of a foreclosure on the collateral or insolvency proceedings, obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid in full with proceeds from the collateral prior to the obligations under the First Lien Notes.\nSecond Lien Notes\nIn December 2010, we issued $104.9 million aggregate principal amounts of senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 13.5% per annum, payable semi-annually, and mature in June 2018 (the \"Second Lien Notes\").\nDuring fiscal 2014, we exchanged approximately $94.3 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes for an equal aggregate principal amount of new second lien senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 10.0% per annum, are payable in kind, and mature in June 2018 (the Second Lien PIK Notes\u201d). See \"Second Lien PIK Notes\" below. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately $0.6 million in aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes in the open market, from the Investors and exchanged approximately $7.8 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes for equity interests in the Parent pursuant to the debt for equity exchange agreement (as discussed below).\nDuring fiscal 2016, we redeemed the remaining $2.2 million in aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes at a price equal to 103.4% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon the full satisfaction and cancellation of all outstanding Second Lien Notes, the collateral agreement securing the Second Lien Notes was terminated and the obligations of the Company under the Indenture governing the Second Lien Notes were satisfied in full.\nThe Second Lien Notes were guaranteed on a second lien senior secured basis by the same subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee our Revolving Credit Facility and the First Lien Notes. The Second Lien Notes and the guarantees thereof were secured by a second-priority lien on substantially all our assets (subject to certain permitted liens and exceptions).\nNew Second Lien Notes\nIn January 2015, we issued approximately $39.0 million aggregate principal amount of New Second Lien Notes to the Investors, which bear interest at a rate of 7.0% per annum and mature in July 2020. Interest on the New Second Lien Notes is payable semi-annually on July 15th and January 15th of each year and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30 day months. As described above, the New Second Lien Notes were issued in exchange for $32.0 million aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes pursuant to an exchange agreement.\nThe New Second Lien Notes were issued under a new indenture (the New Second Lien Notes Indenture\u201d), by and among American Media, Inc., certain of its subsidiaries listed as guarantors thereto (the \"Guarantors\") and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the \"Trustee\"). The New Second Lien Notes were issued through a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nIn March 2016, we issued approximately $159.6 million aggregate principal amount of additional New Second Lien Notes (the \"Additional New Second Lien Notes\"). Approximately $76.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Additional New Second Lien Notes were issued in exchange for approximately $58.9 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes pursuant to the New Second Lien Notes Exchange Agreement, as described above. Approximately $76.2 million in aggregate principal amount of Additional New Second Lien Notes were issued in a distribution to certain holders of equity interests in the Parent, of which approximately $68.8 million was issued to the Investors and approximately $7.4 million was issued to the Officer, and approximately $7.3 million aggregate principal amount of Additional New Second Lien Notes were issued to an affiliate of the Investors for cash.\nThe Additional New Second Lien Notes were issued under the existing New Second Lien Indenture through a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nAt March 31, 2016, the New Second Lien Notes represented an aggregate of $164.4 million of our indebtedness.\nThe New Second Lien Notes and the Additional New Second Lien Notes are guaranteed on a second lien senior secured basis by the same subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee our Revolving Credit Facility, the First Lien Notes and the Second Lien Notes. The New Second Lien Notes and the Additional New Second Lien Notes and the guarantees thereof are secured by a second-priority lien on substantially all our assets (subject to certain permitted liens and exceptions).\nSecond Lien PIK Notes\nDuring fiscal 2014, we issued approximately $94.3 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien PIK Notes in exchange for an equal aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes, pursuant to an exchange agreement (the \"Second Lien PIK Notes Exchange Agreement\"). The Second Lien PIK Notes were issued under an indenture (the \"Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture\"), by and among American Media, Inc., the Guarantors and Trustee.\nDuring fiscal 2015, in connection with the Merger Agreement, we issued approximately $12.3 million in aggregate principal amount of additional Second Lien PIK Notes (the \"Additional Second Lien PIK Notes\"). The Additional Second Lien PIK Notes were issued under the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture, were assigned the same CUSIP number as the outstanding Second Lien PIK Notes and were issued through a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nThe Second Lien PIK Notes were payable in kind at a rate of 10% per annum which totaled $4.8 million and $1.9 million, during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, and was recorded as an increase to the aggregate principal amount of Second Lien PIK Notes outstanding.\nIn September 2014, pursuant to the debt for equity exchange agreement with the Parent and the Investors, the Investors exchanged approximately $113.3 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien PIK Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, which represented all of the outstanding Second Lien PIK Notes, for equity interests in the Parent. Upon the cancellation of all outstanding Second Lien PIK Notes, the collateral agreement securing the Second Lien PIK Notes was terminated and the obligations of the Company under the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture were satisfied in full and the discharge thereof was acknowledged by the Trustee.\nDebt for Equity Conversion\nIn September 2014, AMI entered into the debt for equity exchange agreement with the Parent and the Investors, pursuant to which the Investors converted approximately $7.8 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes and all $113.3 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien PIK Notes into equity interests in the Parent (the Conversion\u201d). The Conversion also included the accrued and unpaid interest since the last semi-annual interest payment on June 15, 2014, totaling approximately $2.9 million.\nSupplemental Indentures\nIn August 2014, AMI received consents from the holders of (a) $218.2 million principal amount of the outstanding First Lien Notes to amend the indenture dated as of December 1, 2010 (as such agreement may be amended, restated or supplemented, the First Lien Notes Indenture\u201d), among AMI, the Guarantors and the Trustee, (b) $7.8 million principal amount of the outstanding Second Lien Notes to amend the indenture dated as of December 22, 2010 (as such agreement may be amended, restated or supplemented, the Second Lien Notes Indenture\u201d and, together with the First Lien Notes Indenture and the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture, the Indentures\u201d), among AMI, the Guarantors and the Trustee and (c) $101 million principal amount of the outstanding Second Lien PIK Notes to amend the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture, which in each case represented the requisite consents from holders of at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable notes then outstanding.\nAs a result of receiving the requisite consents, in August 2014, AMI and the Trustee entered into (a) the Fourth Supplemental Indenture (the First Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture\u201d) to the First Lien Notes Indenture, (b) the Third Supplemental Indenture (the Second Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture\u201d) to the Second Lien Notes Indenture and (c) the First Supplemental Indenture (the Second Lien PIK Notes Supplemental Indenture\u201d and, together with the First Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture and the Second Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture, the Supplemental Indentures\u201d) to the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture.\nThe Supplemental Indentures amend the Indentures to (a) permit the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement including amending the definition of Change of Control\u201d and permitting the issuance of the Additional Second Lien PIK Notes pursuant to the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture; and (b) in the case of the Second Lien PIK Notes Supplemental Indenture only, eliminate AMI's obligation to apply Cash Interest Savings (as defined in the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture) to repurchase outstanding First Lien Notes for the semi-annual interest periods ending on June 15, 2014 and December 15, 2014 (collectively, the Amendments\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Supplemental Indentures, the Supplemental Indentures became effective, and the Amendments became operative, immediately upon execution of the Supplemental Indentures.\nIn January 2015, we entered into a supplemental indenture (the 2015 Supplemental Indenture\u201d) by and between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as successor by merger to Wilmington Trust FSB, as trustee and collateral agent (collectively, the Existing Second Lien Trustee\u201d), to an indenture, dated as of December 22, 2010, by and among the Company, the guarantors party thereto and the Existing Second Lien Trustee (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified through the date of amendment, the Existing Second Lien Indenture\u201d). The 2015 Supplemental Indenture contemplates, among other things, the exchange of First Lien Notes for the New Second Lien Notes.\nIn March 2016, the Company received consents from the holders of (a) $266.1 million principal amount of the outstanding First Lien Notes to amend the indenture dated as of December 1, 2010 (as such agreement may be amended, restated or supplemented, the First Lien Notes Indenture\u201d), among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee and (b) $39.0 million principal amount of the outstanding New Second Lien Notes to amend the indenture dated as of January 20, 2015 (as such agreement may be amended, restated or supplemented, the New Second Lien Notes Indenture\u201d and, together with the First Lien Notes Indenture, the Indentures\u201d), among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee, which in each case represented the requisite consents from holders of at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.\nAs a result of receiving the requisite consents, in March 2016, the Company and the Trustee entered into (a) the Fifth Supplemental Indenture (the First Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture\u201d) to the First Lien Notes Indenture and (b) the First Supplemental Indenture (the New Second Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture\u201d and, together with the First Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture, the Supplemental Indentures\u201d). The Supplemental Indentures amend the First Lien Indenture and the New Second Lien Indenture, as applicable, to, among other things, permit the issuance of the Additional New Second Lien Notes.\nThe Indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes contain certain affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default. For example, the Indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes contain covenants that limit our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries, subject to important exceptions and qualifications, to: borrow money; guarantee other indebtedness; use assets as security in other transactions; pay dividends on stock, redeem stock or redeem subordinated debt; make investments; enter into agreements that restrict the payment of dividends by subsidiaries; sell assets; enter into affiliate transactions; sell capital stock of subsidiaries; enter into new lines of business; and merge or consolidate. In addition, the Indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes impose certain requirements as to future subsidiary guarantors.\nAs of March 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes.\nCovenant Compliance\nAs discussed above, our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes contain various restrictive covenants. With regard to our Revolving Credit Facility, the financial covenants are comprised of a first lien leverage ratio, a consolidated leverage rate and an interest coverage ratio.\nThe first lien leverage ratio covenant is calculated as the Total First Lien Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) and must be equal to or less than 3.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017, the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. The consolidated leverage ratio covenant is calculated as the Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) and must be equal to or less than 5.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017, the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. The interest coverage ratio covenant is calculated as the Consolidated EBITDA to Cash Interest Expense (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) and must be equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017, maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility.\nAs of March 31, 2016, the first lien leverage ratio was 3.05 to 1.00, the consolidated leverage ratio was 5.23 to 1.00 and the interest coverage ratio was 2.06 to 1.00 and the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Second Notes.\nAlthough there can be no assurances, management believes that, based on current expectations (including projected borrowings and repayments under the Revolving Credit Facility and our recent debt initiatives), our operating results for the next twelve months will be sufficient to satisfy the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. Our ability to satisfy such financial covenant is dependent on our business performing in accordance with our projections. If the performance of our business deviates from our projections, we may not be able to satisfy such financial covenants. Our projections are subject to a number of factors, many of which are events beyond our control, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections (see \"Risk Factors\" included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report). If we do not comply with our financial covenants, we would be in default under the Revolving Credit Facility, which could result in all our debt being accelerated due to cross-default provisions in the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes.\nWe have the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations imposed by our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes. Under our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes, in addition to specified permitted indebtedness, we will be able to incur additional indebtedness as long as on a pro forma basis our consolidated leverage ratio is less than 5.50 to 1.00.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA, a measure we use to gauge our operating performance, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to the Company plus interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, provision for impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, deferred financing costs and deferred rack costs, adjusted for merger and related transaction(s) costs, restructuring costs and severance, costs related to launches, re-launches or closures of publications and certain other costs. We believe that the inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to evaluate our operating performance compared to our operating plans and/or prior years and to value prospective acquisitions. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends because Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of certain items that can differ significantly from company to company, depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments.\nManagement believes our investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a gauge to measure the performance of their investment in the Company. Management compensates for limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures by using them to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP results alone can provide. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to income from continuing operations as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management's discretionary use as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to American Media, Inc. and subsidiaries to Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

Fluctuations in quarterly performance are also due to variations in our publication schedule and variability of audience traffic on our websites. Not all of our publications are published on a regular schedule throughout the year. Additionally, the publication schedule for our special interest publications can vary and lead to quarterly fluctuations in our operating results.\nAdvertising revenue from our magazines and websites is typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter due to our health and fitness magazines. During our fourth fiscal quarter, which begins on January 1st, advertisers and consumers are focused on the \"New Year and New You.\" Certain newsstand costs vary from quarter to quarter, particularly marketing costs associated with the distribution of our magazines.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding uncertainties that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to revenue, trade receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes and contingent liabilities.\nWe base our estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and other relevant factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates, judgments and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company's financial position and results of operations, and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The following accounting policies and estimates are those that management deems most critical. For a complete listing of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Revenues and associated accounts receivable are recorded net of provisions for estimated future returns, doubtful accounts and other allowances. Allowances for uncollectible receivables are estimated based upon a combination of write-off history, aging analysis and any specifically identified troubled accounts.\nNewsstand revenues are recognized based on the on-sale dates of magazines and are initially recorded based upon estimates of sales, net of brokerage, returns and estimates of newsstand related fees. Estimated returns are recorded based upon historical experience.\nPrint advertising revenues are recorded based on the on-sale dates of magazines when the advertisement appears in the magazine and are stated net of agency commissions and cash and sales discounts. Digital advertising revenues on the Company's websites are generally based on the sale of impression-based advertisements, which are recorded in the period in which the advertisements are served.\nOther revenues, primarily from licensing opportunities and strategic partnerships for our branded products as well as marketing services performed for third parties by DSI, are recognized when the service is performed.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company's goodwill and related indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate a potential impairment exists. Impairment losses, if any, are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated financial statements. The Company's reporting units consist of each of its publications and other consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe Company reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value. Impairment losses, if any, are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated financial statements.\nIn assessing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment, the Company makes estimates of fair value that are based on its projection of revenues, operating costs and cash flows of each reporting unit, considering historical and anticipated future results and general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies. The valuations employ a combination of income and market approaches to measure fair value. Changes in management's judgments and projections or assumptions used could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could materially change the impairment charge related to goodwill and tradenames. For a detailed description of impairment charges, see Note 3, Goodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets.\u201d\nThe Company did not record any impairment charges during fiscal 2016. The Company continues to evaluate goodwill and other identified intangible assets for impairment. Goodwill and other identified intangible assets are material components of the Company's financial statements and impairment charges to the Company's goodwill or other identified intangible assets in future periods could be material to the Company's results of operations.\nDuring an evaluation of goodwill and other identified intangible assets during fiscal 2015 (at September 30, 2014), the Company determined that indicators were present in certain reporting units which would suggest the fair value of the reporting unit may have declined below the carrying value. This decline was primarily due to the continuing softness in the consumer magazine sector, which impacts consumer and advertising spending, including further declines in certain advertising markets, resulting in lowered future cash flow projections.\nAs a result, an interim impairment test of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets was performed during fiscal 2015 for certain reporting units in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic No. 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d ( ASC 350\u201d). Impairment testing for goodwill is a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment charge, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. Impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible assets, consisting of tradenames, compares the fair value of the tradename to the carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded for any excess carrying value over fair value.\nThe evaluation resulted in the carrying value of goodwill and tradenames for certain reporting units to exceed the estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $8.9 million and $8.5 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and tradenames, respectively, during fiscal 2015.\nAs of March 31, 2016, we identified three reporting units with an excess fair value over carrying value of less than 25%. As of March 31, 2016, National Enquirer, Flex and Muscle & Fitness reporting units had goodwill balances of $59.0 million, $5.4 million and $13.4 million, respectively. For all other reporting units, the fair value is substantially in excess of carrying value as of March 31, 2016. While historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of the reporting units in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in the future additional impairment charges may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material. The Company will continue to monitor the recoverability of its remaining goodwill.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of interim or annual goodwill impairment tests will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as follows:\n \u2022 A prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate (i.e. circulation and advertising decreases) especially in the markets we serve; \n \u2022 An economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree; \n \u2022 Volatility in debt markets resulting in higher discount rates; and \n \u2022 Unexpected regulatory changes for our advertisers. \nIf our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. When such factors, events or circumstances indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of the assets to measure recoverability. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds fair value computed on a discounted cash flow basis.\nThe Company did not record any impairment charges for long-lived tangible and intangible assets during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes requires a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on any changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income.\nRECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity (Topic 205 and Topic 360) (\"ASU 2014-08\") which raises the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations. Under this new guidance, a discontinued operation is (1) a component of an entity or group of components that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale that represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results or (2) an acquired business that is classified as held for sale on the acquisition date. This guidance also requires expanded or new disclosures for discontinued operations, individually material disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation, an entity's continuing involvement with a discontinued operation following disposal, and retained equity method investments in a discontinued operation. ASU 2014-08 was effective for the Company on April 1, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-08 did not have an impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (\"ASU 2015-17\"), which simplifies the presentation of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The new guidance no longer requires the presentation of current deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on a classified balance sheet, rather requiring all to be presented as non-current. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company prospectively adopted this guidance in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. As required by this guidance, all deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which is a change from our historical presentation wherein certain of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were classified as current and the remainder were classified as non-current. The March 31, 2015 balance sheet has not been retrospectively adjusted. As this guidance impacts presentation only, the adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have an impact on the results of operations or cash flows.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Topic 205) (\"ASU 2014-15\"), which establishes management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and setting rules for how this information should be disclosed in the financial statements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual period beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company has not determined the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20) (\"ASU 2015-01\"), which simplifies the income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidations, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (Topic 810) (\"ASU 2015-02\"), which changes the identification of variable interests, the variable interest characteristic for a limited partnership or similar entity and the primary beneficiary determination all of which are intended to improve the consolidation guidance as well as increase transparency and consistency of financial reporting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued a proposal for a one-year deferral of the effective date for ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASU 2014-09\"). Under this proposal, the standard would be effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. As a result of the one-year deferral, ASU 2014-09 will now be effective for the Company on April 1, 2018 using one of two retrospective application methods. The Company has not determined the potential effects on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (Subtopic 835-30) (\"ASU 2015-03\"), which requires the presentation of debt issuance costs to be reflected as a reduction from the face amount of the related debt, with amortization recorded as interest expense, rather than recording as a deferred asset. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2015, and requires retrospective application. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although it will change the financial statement classification of the deferred financing cost. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had $8.1 million and $6.4 million of net deferred financing costs, respectively, included on the consolidated balance sheets. Under the new guidance, the net deferred financing costs would offset the carrying amount of the respective debt on the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) (\"ASU 2015-11\"), which simplifies the measurement of inventory by requiring certain inventory to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim period within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements-Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting, to clarify that an entity may elect to present debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset, regardless of whether or not there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months and disclose certain information about the leasing arrangements. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and the interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and analysis contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in \"Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Information\" and \"Risk Factors\" included in this Annual Report.\nORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION\nOur discussion is presented in the following sections:\n \u2022 Executive Summary \n \u2022 Recent Developments and Management Action Plans \n \u2022 Results of Operations \n \u2022 Operating Segments \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u2022 Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments \n \u2022 Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations \n \u2022 Off-Balance Sheet Financing \n \u2022 Application of Critical Accounting Estimates \n \u2022 Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nAmerican Media, Inc. together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Company\", \"AMI\", \"we\", \"our\" or \"us\") is one of the largest publishers of celebrity and health and active lifestyle magazines in the United States, with a diversified portfolio of 10 publications that have a combined monthly print and digital audience of more than 39 million readers and monthly on-line audience of approximately 49 million readers.\nIn August 2014, American Media, Inc. entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with AMI Parent Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the \"Parent\"), which is controlled by certain investors of AMI (collectively, the \"Investors\"), and AMI Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the \"Merger Sub\"), whereby the Merger Sub was merged with and into American Media, Inc. (the \"Merger\") with American Media, Inc. surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent. As a result of the Merger, the Parent acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of American Media, Inc.\nIn January 2015, we sold our Shape, Fit Pregnancy and Natural Health publications, which comprised our Women's Active Lifestyle segment, for approximately $60 million in cash plus an earnout of up to $60 million. As a result, the operations of the Women's Active Lifestyle segment have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented. After giving effect to the divestiture of our Women's Active Lifestyle segment, we report under a new segment structure beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and accordingly have recast prior period segment amounts.\nOur remaining well-known publications cover two primary operating segments: Celebrity and Men's Active Lifestyle. Within our Celebrity segment, our portfolio of brands includes: National Enquirer, Star, OK!, Globe, National Examiner and Soap Opera Digest. Within our Men's Active Lifestyle segment, our portfolio of brands include: Men's Fitness, Muscle & Fitness, Muscle & Fitness Hers and Flex. Our third, non-operating segment, Corporate and Other, includes our international licensing of certain health and fitness publications, photo syndication for all our media content platforms and strategic management services for publishers.\nWe believe our leadership position in these segments provides us with strong competitive advantages in the publishing market. Our iconic brands have enabled us to build a loyal readership and establish relationships with major advertisers and distributors. We have leveraged the strength of our portfolio of brands through joint ventures, licensing opportunities, and strategic relationships with several national retailers. We believe the combination of our well-known brands, established relationship with advertisers and distributors, and ability to leverage our brands with major retailers and to monetize content across multiple platforms creates a competitive position that is difficult to replicate.\nOur largest revenue stream comes from single copy newsstand sales. Our second largest revenue stream comes from multi-platform advertising. Our primary operating expenses consist of production, distribution, circulation and other cost of sales, as well as selling, general and administrative expenses. We incur most of our operating expenses during the production of our printed magazines, which includes costs for printing and paper. Paper is the principal raw material utilized in our publications. We have a long-term paper supply and purchasing agreement with the largest paper supply broker in the United States which manages all aspects of our raw material paper inventory. The price of paper is driven by market conditions and therefore difficult to predict. Changes in paper prices could significantly affect our business.\nWe are experiencing declines in our circulation revenue and print advertising as a result of market conditions in the magazine publishing industry. These declines are primarily caused by the disruption in our wholesaler distribution channel, the overall decline in the celebrity newsstand market and the decline in the consumer advertising market coupled with the shift in advertising dollars from print to digital. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and current events. Since magazines are generally discretionary purchases for consumers, our circulation revenues are sensitive to economic downturns. Adverse changes in the markets we serve generally result in reductions in revenue as a result of lower consumer spending, which can lead to a reduction in advertising revenue.\nOur fiscal year ended on March 31, 2016 and is referred to herein as fiscal 2016. References to our fiscal year (e.g. \"fiscal 2016\") refer to our fiscal year ended March 31st of the applicable year.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND MANAGEMENT ACTION PLANS\nRecent Developments\nDigital Initiatives\nWe conduct our advertising sales through a combination of corporate and brand sales and marketing teams that sell advertising across multiple media platforms. Our salespeople are divided into specific brand teams, with each team focusing on selling marketing programs that integrate print, digital (such as mobile and desktop), social media and events for our clients. We are also the industry leader in creating sponsored content and native advertising. Combined, our sales teams cover all consumer advertising categories.\nWe have launched digital editions for all our brands on the following platforms: Next Issue Media, Apple, Google newsstand, Zinio, Amazon Kindle and Barnes & Noble's Nook. During fiscal 2016, our digital advertising revenue increased 40% over the comparable prior year period.\nPrint Initiatives\nThe relaunch of Men's Fitness continues to attract new luxury goods advertisers including Ralph Lauren, FIJI Water, Louis Vuitton, Nautica, Energizer and SlimFast. During fiscal 2016, total advertising revenues increased 9% for Men's Fitness as compared to the prior period.\nRelated Operations\nOver the past year, we have developed several unique brand extensions across multiple platforms.\nIn February 2016, we announced a partnership with Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson's company, Seven Bucks Productions. Mr. Johnson is one of the world's biggest box office stars with over $1.4 billion in ticket sales in 2015 and Seven Bucks Productions has over 50 movie, television and digital projects in development. Our initial venture will be a live television broadcast of the Mr. Olympia event from Las Vegas in September 2016. Mr. Johnson will be one of the co-hosts and we are currently in negotiations with a leading broadcast network to air the live broadcast of the Mr. Olympia event.\nWe currently publish a custom magazine for GNC Holdings, Inc. (\"GNC\") on a quarterly basis, utilizing our Men's Fitness (and Shape pursuant to a license agreement) brands. The print version is distributed to approximately 500,000 customers through select GNC stores, with another 1 million digital copies distributed via email to GNC's database of customers. GNC leverages its vendors to advertise in the magazine and AMI retains 100% of the advertising revenues.\nThe REELZ Channel, available in 68 million homes, recently premiered a new television series, National Enquirer Investigates and the Discovery Channel will launch a series called Enquiring Minds this fall. We are partnering with The Weinstein Company on both of these televisions series. There is also a feature film and documentary drama television series on The National Enquirer in development with IMG/WME.\nDebt Related Transactions\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2016, AMI repurchased $2.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 11.5% per annum and mature in December 2017 (the \"First Lien Notes\"), plus accrued and unpaid interest in the open market, from the Investors.\nIn February 2016, we amended the revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\") to, among other things, extend the maturity date to June 2017, modify the financial covenants in effect through the date of maturity and provide for certain other provisions.\nIn March 2016, AMI exchanged approximately $58.9 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, held by the Investors, for approximately $76.0 million aggregate principal amount of new second lien senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 7.0% per annum and mature in July 2020 (the \"New Second Lien Notes\"), pursuant to an exchange agreement (the \"New Second Lien Notes Exchange Agreement\").\nIn addition to the New Second Lien Notes Exchange Agreement, AMI also issued, in March 2016, approximately $76.2 million in aggregate principal amount of New Second Lien Notes in a distribution to holders of equity interests in the Parent, of which approximately $68.8 million was issued to the Investors and approximately $7.4 million was issued to AMI's Chief Executive Officer (the \"Officer\"), and approximately $7.3 million aggregate principal amount of New Second Lien Notes were issued to an affiliate of the Investors in exchange for cash.\nIn March 2016, AMI repurchased the remaining $2.2 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 13.5% per annum and mature in June 2018 (the \"Second Lien Notes\"), plus accrued and unpaid interest in the open market. Upon the full satisfaction and cancellation of all outstanding Second Lien Notes, the collateral agreement securing the Second Lien Notes was terminated and AMI's obligations under the Indenture governing the Second Lien Notes were satisfied in full.\nSee \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Secured Notes\" within this Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" for a further discussion regarding our debt agreements.\nWholesaler Transition\nSeveral of our wholesalers, including our former second-largest wholesaler, Source Interlink Companies (\"Source\"), ceased operation during 2014. Since then we have transitioned the previous wholesalers' newsstand distribution (approximately 25% of the market) to the two remaining major wholesalers. This transition had an immediate adverse impact on single copy newsstand sales and liquidity during fiscal 2015 and into the first half of fiscal 2016.\nManagement Action Plans for Cost Savings\nDuring fiscal 2016, we developed and implemented management action plans that resulted in $18.4 million of cost savings in fiscal 2016 and that we expect will result in approximately $6.8 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017 (the \"2016 and 2017 Management Action Plans\"). These expense reductions were primarily from outsourcing technology and operating functions, digital content re-negotiations, print order efficiencies and editorial and advertising sales staff consolidations. We will realize the benefits from the 2016 and 2017 Management Action Plans during fiscal 2016 and beyond.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we developed and implemented management action plans that resulted in $6.6 million of cost savings in fiscal 2016 and $6.4 million of cost savings in fiscal 2015 (the \"2016 and 2015 Management Action Plans\"). These expense reductions were primarily from outsourcing technology and operating functions, digital content re-negotiations, and editorial and advertising sales expense reductions. We realized the benefits from the 2016 and 2015 Management Action Plans in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 and certain of these costs savings may benefit fiscal 2017 and beyond.\nReference to Management Action Plans refers to the 2016 and 2017 Management Action Plans and the 2016 and 2015 Management Action Plans.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides a summary of our operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\n* - Represents an increase or decrease in excess of 100%.\nOperating Revenues\nDuring fiscal 2016, total operating revenues decreased $22.1 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to reduced circulation ($23.4 million), partially offset by increased advertising ($0.9 million) and other revenues ($0.3 million).\nCirculation revenue has declined due to the overall decline in the celebrity newsstand magazine market, coupled with the planned discontinuance of our special interest publications ($2.5 million) and certain foreign editions of Muscle & Fitness and Flex ($1.9 million), and the sale of our Country Weekly publication ($2.8 million). The increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to digital. Other revenue increased primarily due to the elimination of joint venture losses recognized in prior years coupled with the increase in revenue from the Mr. Olympia event, partially offset by reduced publishing services revenue.\nTotal operating revenue decreased $42.2 million during fiscal 2015 primarily due to reduced circulation ($21.4 million), advertising ($5.7 million) and other revenues ($15.1 million).\nCirculation revenue declined due to the industry-wide disruption in our wholesaler channel coupled with the decline in the celebrity newsstand magazine market. Advertising revenue declined due to the 11% decline in the consumer advertising market. The decline in other revenue was due to the divestiture of our distribution and merchandising business (DSI) in September 2013 ($5.2 million), coupled with an unfavorable timing of certain non-recurring revenue streams ($8.2 million), partially offset by higher revenue from the Mr. Olympia event ($1.3 million).\nThe following table summarizes our operating revenues, by type, as a percentage of total operating revenues:\n\nCirculation Revenue\nOur circulation revenue was generated from the following components for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\nOur circulation revenue, representing the sale of magazines to consumers, generates more than half of our total revenues and is an important component in determining our advertising revenues because advertising rates are dependent on circulation and audience. Single copy sales (also known as newsstand sales) are sold primarily through national distributors, wholesalers and retailers. Subscriptions are sold primarily through direct mail, or digitally via the Internet. Additionally, digital-only subscriptions and single-copy digital issues of our magazines are sold or distributed through various app stores and other digital storefronts. Our digital subscriptions represent 15% of our 2.0 million net subscriptions as of March 31, 2016, the highest percentage among our competitive set.\nCirculation revenue declined $23.4 million during fiscal 2016 due to the overall reduction in the celebrity magazine sector ($14.1 million) coupled with the planned discontinuance of our special interest publications ($2.5 million) and certain foreign editions of Muscle & Fitness and Flex ($1.9 million), and the sale of our Country Weekly publication ($2.8 million). During fiscal 2015, circulation revenue declined $21.4 million primarily due to the wholesaler transition ($16.6 million) coupled with the sale of our Country Weekly publication ($2.5 million).\nAdvertising Revenue\nOur advertising revenue was generated from the following components for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\nThe sale of advertising across our multiple platforms generates approximately one-third of our total revenues. Print advertising revenue continues to be negatively impacted by the decline in the consumer magazine sector coupled with the transformation of advertising from print to digital.\nWe conduct our advertising sales through a combination of corporate and brand sales and marketing teams that sell advertising across multiple media platforms. Our salespeople are divided into specific brand teams, with each team focusing on selling marketing programs that integrate print, digital (such as mobile and desktop), social media and events for our clients. We are also the industry leader in creating sponsored content and native advertising. Combined, our sales teams cover all consumer advertising categories.\nThe rates at which we sell print advertising depend on each magazine's rate base, which is the circulation of the magazine that we guarantee to our advertisers, as well as our audience size. If we are not able to meet our committed rate base, the price paid by advertisers is generally subject to downward adjustments, including in the form of future credits or discounts. Our published rates for each of our magazines are subject to negotiation with each of our advertisers.\nAdvertising revenue increased $0.9 million during fiscal 2016 due to higher digital advertising ($4.1 million), partially offset by the decline in print advertising ($0.4 million) and the planned discontinuance of certain foreign editions of Muscle & Fitness and Flex ($2.3 million) and the sale of Country Weekly ($0.5 million). During fiscal 2015, advertising revenue decreased $5.7 million due to lower print advertising revenue ($7.7 million), partially offset by higher digital advertising ($2.0 million).\nOther Revenue\nOur other revenue represented 5% of our operating revenues during fiscal 2016 and 2015 and10% during fiscal 2014.\nDuring fiscal 2016, other revenue increased $0.3 million due to the timing of certain non-recurring streams, partially offset by the reduction in publishing services.\nOther revenues decreased $15.1 million during fiscal 2015 primarily due to the divestiture of our distribution and merchandising company (DSI) in September 2013 ($5.2 million) coupled with an unfavorable timing of certain non-recurring revenue streams ($8.2 million), partially offset by the increased revenue from the Mr. Olympia event ($1.3 million).\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses are comprised of the following for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\n* - Represents an increase or decrease in excess of 100%.\nCosts of Revenues\nCosts of revenues consist of costs related to the production of our printed magazines, editorial costs, as well as other expenses.\nOur production costs, including paper and printing costs, accounted for approximately 28%, 26% and 30%, respectively, of our total operating expenses for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. Paper is the principal raw material utilized in our publications and we have a long-term paper supply and purchasing agreement with the largest paper supply broker in the United States.\nEditorial costs include costs associated with manuscripts, photographs and related salaries and accounted for approximately 13%, 11% and 12%, respectively for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nOur distribution, circulation and other expenses consist primarily of postage and freight for shipment to our wholesalers and fulfillment companies and accounted for approximately 18%, 16% and 18%, respectively, of our total operating expenses for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. We are subject to postal rate increases that affect delivery costs and effective May 31, 2015, rates for all classes of mail were increased by approximately 2% by the Postal Regulation Commission.\nTotal costs of revenues decreased during fiscal 2016 and 2015 due to the Management Action Plans in the following areas: $11.8 million in production, $1.9 million in editorial and $2.8 million in distribution and circulation for fiscal 2016 and a reduction of $9.6 million in production, $4.1 million in editorial and $7.0 million in distribution and circulation for fiscal 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative costs decreased $31.2 million during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the Management Action Plans for employee-related expenses ($12.2 million), as well as reduced wholesaler-related bad debt expense ($8.4 million), accounting and legal fees ($1.6 million), other non-recurring expenses ($3.5 million) and costs associated with restructuring ($1.5 million).\nDuring fiscal 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses increased $8.3 million as compared to the prior year periods primarily due the Merger and related transactions ($4.8 million), bad debt expense due to the wholesaler bankruptcy ($3.3 million), costs associated with restructuring ($1.5 million) and the timing of gains from insurance settlement recognized in the prior comparable period ($1.4 million), partially offset by the divestiture of our distribution and merchandising company (DSI) in September 2013 ($2.1 million).\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses, which are non-cash, increased $12.5 million and $0.5 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to the reclassification of certain tradenames from indefinite-lived to finite-lived.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThere were no impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2016.\nDuring an evaluation of goodwill and other identified intangible assets during fiscal 2015 and 2014, we determined that indicators were present in certain reporting units that would suggest the fair value of the reporting unit may have declined below the carrying value. This decline was primarily the result of the near-term advertising revenue shortfall coupled with the continued softness in the print publication industry overall, which resulted in lowered future cash flow projections.\nAs a result, an impairment test of goodwill and identified intangible assets was performed for certain reporting units. The evaluation resulted in the carrying value of goodwill and tradenames for certain reporting units to exceed the fair value. As a result, the Company recorded pre-tax non-cash impairment charge totaling $18.5 million for goodwill and tradenames during fiscal 2015 and $9.2 million for tradenames during fiscal 2014, respectively.\nNon-Operating Items\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $11.2 million and $7.5 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, when compared to the prior year period due to the exchange, in March 2016 and January 2015, of certain senior secured notes.\nAmortization of Deferred Financing Costs\nAmortization of deferred financing costs remained consistent during fiscal 2016 and increased $2.3 million during fiscal 2015, when compared to the prior year period due to the exchange, in March 2016 and January 2015, of certain senior secured notes.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $36.0 million and $15.7 million and during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance. This was a direct result of the reclassification of certain tradenames from indefinite lived to finite lived effective October 1, 2014 and April 1, 2015.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to American Media, Inc.\nThe $17.0 million of net income attributable to American Media, Inc. for fiscal 2016 represents a $44.1 million improvement from the comparable prior year period. This improvement is primarily attributable to the $31.5 million increase in operating income, the $20.3 million increase in benefit for income taxes coupled with the $11.2 million decrease in interest expense, partially offset by the $15.3 million decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax and the $3.7 million decrease in other income.\nThe $27.1 million of net loss attributable to American Media, Inc. for fiscal 2015 represents a $27.2 million improvement from the comparable prior year period. This improvement is primarily attributable to the $46.3 million decrease in provision for income taxes, the $11.6 million increase in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, and the $7.5 million decrease in interest expense, partially offset by the $39.6 million decrease in operating income.\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\nOur operating segments consist of: Celebrity Brands, Men's Active Lifestyle and Corporate and Other. After the divestiture of our Women's Active Lifestyle segment, we report under a new segment structure beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Given this change, we have restated prior period segment information to correspond to the current reporting structure. This structure is organized according to the markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing the best content to a wide range of consumers.\nOur operating segments consist of the following brands in print and digital, as of March 31, 2016:\nCelebrity Brands Segment\n \u2022 National Enquirer, a weekly, hard news, investigating tabloid covering all celebrities, politics, crime, human interest, health and fashion. We recently appointed Dick Morris as the chief political commentator and contributor to expand our political coverage; \n \u2022 Star, a weekly, celebrity-focused, news-based, glossy magazine covering movie, television and reality stars and music celebrities. Star's editorial content includes fashion, beauty, accessories and health sections; \n \u2022 OK!, a younger weekly, celebrity-friendly, news-based, glossy magazine covering the stars of movies, television, reality and music. OK!'s editorial content has fashion, beauty and accessories sections; OKMagazine.com differentiates itself through its use of online communities and social media to encourage a dialog between users, including their editorial point of view; \n \u2022 Globe, a weekly tabloid that focuses on older movie and television celebrities, the royal family, political scandals and investigative crime stories that are less mainstream and more salacious than the National Enquirer; \n \u2022 National Examiner, a weekly tabloid (currently available only in print format) consisting of celebrity and human interest stories, differentiating it from the other titles through its upbeat positioning as the source for gossip, contests, women's service and good news for an older tabloid audience; and \n \u2022 Soap Opera Digest, a weekly magazine that provides behind-the-scenes scoops and breaking news to passionate soap opera fans every week; SoapOperaDigest.com is a companion site that mirrors the magazine's editorial point of view. \nMen's Active Lifestyle Segment\n \u2022 Men's Fitness, an active lifestyle magazine for men 18-34 years old, which positions fitness as the new measure of success, as reflected in its editorial coverage of men's fashion, grooming, automotive, finance, travel and other lifestyle categories; Men's Fitness is also home to the latest in exercise techniques, sports training, nutrition and health; Men'sFitness.com provides everything for every man in terms of a healthy and fit lifestyle; \n \u2022 Muscle & Fitness, a fitness physique training magazine appealing to exercise enthusiasts and athletes of all ages, especially those focused on resistance training, body fat control, sports nutrition and supplements; MuscleandFitness.com provides workout videos and nutritional advice; \n \u2022 Flex, a magazine devoted to professional bodybuilding featuring nutrition, supplement and performance science content for bodybuilding enthusiasts and coverage of all professional and amateur bodybuilding contests; Flexonline.com features online coverage of all the major bodybuilding competitions, as well as training videos with today's top bodybuilders; \n \u2022 Muscle & Fitness Hers, a fitness physique training magazine designed for active women who want more out of fitness, especially those who work extra hard to achieve a \"super-fit\" lifestyle, and covers training, nutrition, health, beauty and fashion for today's women; \n \u2022 Mr. Olympia, a four-day event held annually in September in Las Vegas attracting more than 50,000 fans of bodybuilding and fitness experts from around the world; includes a two-day health and fitness exposition with 340 exhibitors including physical exercise challenges and merchandising opportunities that culminates with the world's most prestigious and largest event in bodybuilding and fitness, the Mr. Olympia contest; and \n \u2022 Weider UK, a wholly-owned subsidiary, publishes Muscle & Fitness and Flex in the United Kingdom, France and Germany and licenses the content in Holland and Australia. Each market edition is in a local language with local content and has its own website. \nCorporate and Other Segment\nThis segment includes revenues from international licensing of certain health and fitness publications, photo syndication for all our media content platforms and strategic management services for publishers, including back-office functions. Corporate overhead expenses are not allocated to other segments and are as follows: corporate executives, production, circulation, information technology, accounting, legal, human resources, business development and administrative department costs.\nFinancial Information Regarding Our Operating Segments\nWe use operating income (loss) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments and present operating income (loss) before impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, if any, to provide a consistent and comparable measure of our performance between periods. Management uses operating income (loss) before impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, if any, when communicating financial results to the board of directors, stockholders, debt holders and investors as well as when determining performance goals for executive compensation. Management believes this non-GAAP measure, although not a substitute for GAAP, improves comparability. Management also believes our stockholders, debt holders and investors use this measure as a gauge to assess the performance of their investment in the Company.\nWe prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. Our calculations of operating income (loss) herein may be different from the calculations used by other companies, therefore comparability may be limited. The accounting policies for the operating segments are the same as those described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report, specifically Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\nThe following table summarizes our total operating revenues by segment:\n\nTotal operating revenues decreased $22.1 million during fiscal 2016 primarily due to reduced circulation ($23.4 million), partially offset by increased advertising ($0.9 million) and other revenues ($0.3 million). During fiscal 2015, total operating revenue decreased $42.2 million primarily due to reduced circulation ($21.4 million), advertising ($5.7 million) and other revenues ($15.1 million).\nThe following table summarizes the percentage of segment operating revenues:\n\nThe following table summarizes our segment operating income before impairment for goodwill and intangible assets:\n\n* - Represents an increase or decrease in excess of 100%.\nTotal operating income before impairment increased $13.0 million during fiscal 2016 primarily due to the $35.2 million decrease in operating expenses due to the planned expense savings pursuant to the Management Action Plans, partially offset by the $22.1 million decline in operating revenues as mentioned above.\nDuring fiscal 2015, total operating income before impairment decreased $30.3 million primarily due to the $42.2 million decrease in operating revenue previously mentioned, partially offset by the $11.8 million decrease in operating expenses related to the divestiture of our distribution and merchandising company and the planned expense savings pursuant to the Management Action Plans.\nThere were no impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2016. The pre-tax non-cash impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets was $18.5 million and $9.2 million, respectively during fiscal 2015 and 2014, and impacted the Men's Active Lifestyle segment goodwill and tradenames. The pre-tax non-cash impairment charges were primarily the result of the near-term advertising revenue shortfall coupled with the continued softness in the print publication industry overall, which resulted in lowered future cash flow projections. See the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report, specifically Note 3, \"Goodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets.\"\nCelebrity Brands Segment\nThe Celebrity Brands segment comprised 74%, 73% and 71% our total operating revenues for fiscal 2016, 2015 for fiscal 2014, respectively.\nOperating Revenues\nTotal operating revenues in the Celebrity Brands segment were $164.4 million for fiscal 2016, representing a decrease of $15.5 million, or 9%, over the comparable prior year period. For our continuing publications, total operating revenues declined $10.1 million, or 6%. Circulation revenue declined $14.1 million, or 10%, due to a reduction in the celebrity newsstand market of 12%. This was partially offset by the 11% increase in advertising revenue ($3.0 million) from National Enquirer, OK! and Star, which is counterintuitive to the consumer advertising market, which was down 10%. Total operating revenues were further impacted by the planned discontinuance of our special interest publications ($2.5 million) and the sale of Country Weekly ($2.8 million).\nDuring fiscal 2015, total operating revenues in the Celebrity Brands segment were $179.8 million, representing a decrease of $22.8 million, or 11%, over the comparable prior year period. For our continuing publications, total operating revenues declined $19.2 million, or 10%. Circulation revenue declined $16.6 million, or 10%, due to a reduction in the celebrity newsstand sales primarily due to the industry-wide newsstand distribution disruption, coupled with the 6% decline in advertising revenue ($1.7 million) due to the 11% decline in the consumer magazine sector. Total operating revenues were further impacted by the planned discontinuance of our special interest publications ($0.8 million) and the sale of Country Weekly ($2.5 million).\nOperating Income\nThe Celebrity Brands segment operating income before impairment decreased $13.8 million, or 20%, to $54.1 million during fiscal 2016. This decline was due to the revenue declines previously discussed coupled with an increase in amortization expenses ($11.3 million) related to the reclassification of certain tradenames from indefinite-lived intangibles to finite-lives of 15 years, effective April 1, 2015. These declines are partially offset by the planned reduction in expenses ($13.1 million) pursuant to our Management Action Plans.\nOperating income before impairment in the Celebrity Brands segment decreased during fiscal 2015 from prior year by $5.4 million, or 7%, to $67.9 million. This decline was due to the revenue declines mentioned above, partially offset by the planned reduction in expenses ($17.4 million) pursuant to our Management Action Plans.\nMen's Active Lifestyle Segment\nThe Men's Active Lifestyle segment represented 25%, 24% and 23% of our consolidated operating revenues for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOperating Revenues\nTotal operating revenues in the Men's Active Lifestyle segment were $55.6 million during fiscal 2016, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 6%, over the comparable prior year period. This decline was due to the discontinuance of certain foreign editions of Muscle & Fitness and Flex ($4.9 million) coupled with the decline in print advertising ($1.1 million). These declines were partially offset by the increase in digital advertising revenue ($2.0 million), primarily from Men's Fitness ($1.1 million) and Muscle & Fitness ($0.9 million) due to a 17% and 11% increase in page views, respectively, coupled with the increase in revenue from the Mr. Olympia event ($0.8 million or 12%).\nDuring fiscal 2015, total operating revenues in the Men's Active Lifestyle segment were $59.2 million, a decrease $7.5 million, or 11%, over the comparable prior year period. The decline in circulation revenue ($2.6 million) and print advertising revenue ($7.1 million) was primarily due to the reduction in the publishing frequency of Muscle & Fitness and Flex, from twelve times per year to ten times per year (or two less issues) during fiscal 2015. Print advertising revenue has also been negatively impacted during fiscal 2015 by a major advertiser who shifted their entire advertising budget ($4.0 million) from print to digital and social advertising platform investments outside the Men's Active Lifestyle category. A portion of this advertising business did return to the Men's Active Lifestyle segment during fiscal 2016. These declines were partially offset by the increase in digital advertising revenue ($1.3 million), which is directly attributable to the relaunch and repositioning of Men's Fitness, and the increased revenues from the Mr. Olympia event ($1.3 million, or 26%).\nOperating Income\nThe Men's Active Lifestyle segment operating income before impairment increased $1.6 million, or 13% to $13.1 million during fiscal 2016. Our planned Management Action Plans reduced expenses by $6.5 million, which was partially offset by an increase in amortization expense ($1.4 million) related to certain tradenames as discussed above coupled with the revenue decline previously mentioned.\nOperating income before impairment in the Men's Active Lifestyle segment declined during fiscal 2015 from the prior year by $9.4 million, or 45%, to $11.6 million. This decline is due to the reasons mentioned above coupled with an increase in amortization expense related to the classification of certain tradenames ($1.5 million).\nCorporate and Other Segment\nThe Corporate and Other segment was 1%, 3% and 6% of our consolidated operating revenues for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOperating Revenues\nTotal operating revenues in the Corporate and Other segment were $3.1 million during fiscal 2016, a decline of $3.1 million, or 50%, compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the planned reduction in publishing services ($1.3 million) and books publishing ($0.3 million).\nDuring fiscal 2015, total operating revenues in the Corporate and Other segment were $6.1 million, a decrease of $11.9 million, or 66%, from the prior year. This decline was attributable to the divestiture of our distribution and merchandising company in September 2013 ($5.2 million), the timing of the custom video projects for Microsoft ($4.7 million) and the cessation of certain publishing services ($2.3 million).\nOperating Loss\nTotal operating loss before impairment decreased by $25.3 million, or 38%, to $41.5 million during fiscal 2016, compared to the prior year period. This improvement was attributable to the Management Action Plans for employee-related expenses ($11.3 million), as well as reduced wholesaler bad debt expenses ($7.3 million), accounting and legal fees ($1.3 million) and the other non-recurring expenses ($3.5 million), partially offset by the $3.1 million decline in operating revenue previously discussed.\nDuring fiscal 2015, total operating loss before impairment increased by $15.6 million, or 30%, to $66.8 million. This increase was attributable to the $11.9 million decline in operating revenue coupled with a $3.6 million increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased primarily due to the bad debt expense related to the wholesaler shutdowns ($3.3 million) and the costs incurred for the Merger and other related transactions ($3.4 million), coupled with the timing of the gains on insurance settlement recognized in the prior comparable period ($1.4 million). These expense increases were partially offset by the $5.2 million decrease in operating expenses related to the divestiture of our distribution and merchandising business.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nManagement's Assessment of Liquidity\nOur operations have historically generated positive net cash flow from operating activities. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash generated from operations, amounts available under our revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\") and cash interest savings from our recent debt initiatives.\nOur principal uses of cash that affect our liquidity include operational expenditures and debt service costs, including interest payments on and repurchases of our senior secured notes. In addition to the dispositions discussed elsewhere, we expect to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. These transactions, if consummated, could be material and may involve cash or the issuance of additional senior secured notes.\nAs of March 31, 2016, the Company had $1.4 million of cash, $15.4 million available pursuant to the Revolving Credit Facility and a working capital deficit of $32.7 million, of which approximately $26.6 million relates to deferred revenues. In February 2016, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date to June 2017 and modify the financial covenants in effect through the date of maturity.\nIn addition to outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, as of March 31, 2016, there was $378.7 million principal amount of outstanding senior secured debt. Over the next year, the cash interest payments due under these debt agreements are approximately $40.2 million and there are no scheduled principal payments due.\nWe expect that our current cash balances, cash generated from operating activities, availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, and the cash interest savings from the recent debt initiatives should be sufficient to meet working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other cash needs for the next year.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences for the business and operations. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" included in this Annual Report, specifically, \"Our substantial indebtedness and our ability to incur additional indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and result of operations.\"\nWholesaler Transition\nSeveral of our wholesalers, including our former second-largest wholesaler, Source Interlink Companies (\"Source\"), ceased operation during 2014. Since then we have transitioned the previous wholesalers' newsstand distribution (approximately 25% of the market) to the two remaining major wholesalers. This transition had an immediate adverse impact on single copy newsstand sales and liquidity during fiscal 2015 and into the first half of fiscal 2016. We are beginning to see a stabilization in the newsstand sales, and the wholesale supply chain currently and primarily consists of two private companies, owned by billionaires, that have been in the business for decades.\nThere can be no assurances that our revenue will not be temporarily or permanently reduced if consumers at the impacted retailers do not resume purchasing our publications at the same rate or quantities previously purchased. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" included in this Annual Report, specifically, \"Our circulation revenue consists of single copy sales distributed to retailers primarily by two wholesalers and the loss of either of these wholesalers could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\"\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following information has been derived from the accompanying consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $2.1 million during fiscal 2016 and increased $0.4 million during fiscal 2015. The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows:\n\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by our non-cash items, changes in working capital and the impact of our results of operations. Non-cash items consist primarily of the provision (benefit) for deferred income taxes, depreciation and amortization, amortization of deferred financing costs and deferred rack costs and provisions for doubtful accounts.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 million and $12.7 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decline of $9.2 million, primarily due to the $30.9 million net decrease in non-cash items coupled with the $22.2 million net change in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by the $43.9 million increase in our results of operations.\nNon-cash items decreased primarily due to the decrease in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $18.5 million, the decrease in provision for doubtful accounts of $8.7 million, the decrease in non-cash payment-in-kind interest accretion of $4.8 million for certain senior secured notes, the increase in benefit for income taxes of $3.9 million and the decrease in the loss on sale of assets of $2.5 million, partially offset by the increase in depreciation and amortization of $11.6 million.\nThe net change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to the $35.6 million net change in accounts payable and accrued expenses,\nthe $10.3 million net change in inventories resulting from our agreement to outsource paper purchases and the $4.3 million net change in prepaid expenses, partially offset by the $20.6 million net change in trade receivables, the net change in deferred revenue of $3.8 million, the net change in accrued interest of $3.4 million and the net change in deferred rack costs of $2.7 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $2.9 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the $27.4 million increase in our results of operations coupled with the $16.0 million net change in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by the $40.5 million net increase in non-cash items.\nNon-cash items decreased primarily due to the decrease in provision for income taxes of $64.7 million, partially offset by the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of $9.2 million, the increase in provision for doubtful accounts of $3.4 million, the loss on sale of assets of $2.5 million, the increase in non-cash payment-in-kind interest accretion of $2.9 million for certain senior secured notes and the net decrease in amortization of deferred rack and deferred financing costs of $1.6 million.\nThe net change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to the $7.6 million net change in inventories resulting from our agreement to outsource paper purchases, the $6.7 million net change in prepaid expenses, the $3.6 million net change in accounts payable and accrued expenses, the $3.4 million net change in trade receivables, partially offset by the net change in deferred revenue of $2.7 million and the net change in accrued interest of $2.2 million.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.7 million for fiscal 2016, a decrease of $58.3 million, compared to $55.7 million of net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to the $63.0 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets and the $2.6 million decrease in proceeds from affiliates, partially offset by the $7.2 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment and intangibles assets.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $55.7 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of $74.5 million compared to $18.8 million of net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to the $63.0 million in proceeds from the sale of assets and the $2.6 million in proceeds from affiliates coupled with the $2.5 million decrease in investment in affiliates plus the $6.2 million decrease in purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2016 was $2.6 million, a decrease of $64.6 million, compared to $67.2 million of net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to the $53.7 million decrease in repurchases of certain senior secured notes, the $14.8 million decrease in net borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the $4.3 million decrease in costs incurred in the restructuring, partially offset by the $5.5 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of certain senior secured notes and the $2.3 million increase in deferred financing costs.\nNet cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2015 was $67.2 million, an increase of $76.7 million, compared to $9.5 million of net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to the $55.8 million increase in repurchases of certain senior secured notes, the $31.3 million decrease in net borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by the $12.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of certain senior secured notes and the $4.0 million decrease in payments for the redemption of Odyssey preferred stock.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Senior Secured Notes\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe maintain a revolving credit facility that provides for borrowing up to $35.0 million, less outstanding letters of credit, which matures in June 2017 (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"). The Investors became a lending party to the Revolving Credit Facility during fiscal 2015 and represent a commitment of approximately 42% of the Revolving Credit Facility. See \"Revolving Credit Facility Amendments\" below for additional historical information.\nWe have the option to pay interest based on (i) a floating base rate option equal to the greatest of (x) the prime rate in effect on such day; (y) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus \u00bd of 1%; and (z) one month LIBOR (but no less than 2%) plus 1%, or (ii) LIBOR, in each case, plus a margin. The interest rate under the Revolving Credit Facility has ranged from 8.00% to 8.50% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.50% to 0.75% on the unused portion of the revolving commitment. Commitment fees paid during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 were insignificant.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we borrowed $72.7 million and repaid $72.2 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. At March 31, 2016, the available borrowing capacity is $15.4 million, after considering the $15.2 million outstanding balance and the $4.4 million outstanding letter of credit. The Revolving Credit Facility is included in non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements based on the June 2017 maturity date.\nThe indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain of the domestic subsidiaries of the Company and is secured by liens on substantially all the assets of the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries. In addition, the Company's obligations are secured by a pledge of all the issued and outstanding shares of, or other equity interests in, certain of the Company's existing or subsequently acquired or organized domestic subsidiaries and a percentage of the capital stock of, or other equity interests in, certain of its existing or subsequently acquired or organized foreign subsidiaries.\nCovenants\nThe Revolving Credit Facility includes certain representations and warranties, conditions precedent, affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default. The negative covenants include financial maintenance covenants comprised of a first lien leverage ratio, a consolidated leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict paying dividends, incurring additional indebtedness, creating liens, making acquisitions or other investments, entering into certain mergers or consolidations and selling or otherwise disposing of assets. With respect to the dividend restrictions, there is a cap on the total amount of cash available for distribution to our common stockholders.\nWith regard to the financial maintenance covenants, the first lien leverage ratio covenant must be equal to or less than 3.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017. The consolidated leverage ratio covenant must be equal to or less than 5.50 to 1.00 from October 1, 2015 through June 2017. The interest coverage ratio must be equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nAlthough there can be no assurances, management believes that, based on current projections (including projected borrowings and repayments under the Revolving Credit Facility), its operating results for fiscal 2017 will be sufficient to satisfy the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company's ability to satisfy the financial covenants is dependent on the business performing in accordance with its projections. If the performance of the Company's business deviates significantly from its projections, the Company may not be able to satisfy such financial covenants. The Company's projections are subject to a number of factors, many of which are events beyond its control, which could cause its actual results to differ materially from its projections. If the Company does not comply with its financial covenants, the Company will be in default under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nRevolving Credit Facility Amendments\nIn December 2010, we entered into a revolving credit facility with an original maturity date of December 2015 with a commitment for borrowing up to $40.0 million, less outstanding letters of credit. In February 2015, we amended and restated the revolving credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date to December 2016, reduce the borrowing capacity from $40.0 million to $35.0 million and amend the first lien leverage ratio and certain other covenants and provisions.\nIn February 2016, the Company, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent\u201d), and the lenders from time to time party to the Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, restated, modified or supplemented from time to time, entered into the first amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility with the lenders (the Consenting Lenders\u201d) constituting the Required Lenders (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) to, among other things, extend the maturity date to June 2017, modify the financial covenants in effect through the date of maturity, and provide for certain other provisions.\nWith regard to the financial covenants, the first lien leverage ratio covenant must be equal to or less than 4.25 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017, provided that the first lien leverage ratio covenant will be lowered to 4.00 to 1.00 if the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company's first lien notes is less than $250 million. The consolidated leverage ratio covenant must be equal to or less than 5.25 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017, provided that the consolidated leverage ratio covenant will be lowered to 5.00 to 1.00 if the outstanding principal amount of the Company's first lien notes is less than $250 million. The interest coverage ratio was not amended and must be equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017.\nIn March 2016, the Company, the Administrative Agent and the lenders from time to time party to the Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, restated, modified or supplemented from time to time, entered into the second amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility with the Consenting Lenders constituting the Required Lenders to, among other things, allow for the issuance of additional indebtedness, modify the financial covenants in effect through the date of maturity, and provide for certain other provisions.\nWith regard to the financial covenants, the first lien leverage ratio covenant must be equal to or less than 3.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017 and the provision to lower the first lien leverage ratio based on the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company's first lien notes was removed in its entirety. The consolidated leverage ratio must be equal to or less than 5.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017 and the provision to lower the consolidated leverage ratio based on the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Company's first lien notes was removed in its entirety. The interest coverage ratio was not amended and must be equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017.\nSenior Secured Notes\nOur senior secured notes may be comprised of the first lien notes, the second lien notes, the new second lien notes and the second lien PIK notes and are collectively referred to herein as the \"Senior Secured Notes.\" See \"Supplemental Indentures\" below for a discussion of the amendments to the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes.\nFirst Lien Notes\nIn December 2010, we issued $385.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 11.5% per annum, payable semi-annually, and mature in December 2017 (the \"First Lien Notes\").\nDuring fiscal 2012, we redeemed $20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately $2.3 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes in the open market, from the Investors. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased $55.5 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes in the open market, from the Investors. We also exchanged $32.0 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes held by the Investors, for approximately $39.0 million aggregate principal amount of new second lien senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 7.0% per annum and mature in July 2020 (the \"New Second Lien Notes\"), pursuant to an exchange agreement.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we repurchased $2.0 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes, at a price equal to 105.9% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest in the open market, from the Investors. In March 2016, we exchanged approximately $58.9 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, held by the Investors, for approximately $76.0 million in aggregate principal amount of New Second Lien Notes, pursuant to an exchange agreement (the \"New Second Lien Notes Exchange Agreement\"), as further described below.\nAt March 31, 2016, the First Lien Notes represented an aggregate of $214.3 million of our indebtedness.\nThe First Lien Notes are guaranteed on a first lien senior secured basis by the same subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility. The First Lien Notes and the guarantees thereof are secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all our assets (subject to certain permitted liens and exceptions), pari passu with the liens granted under our Revolving Credit Facility, provided that in the event of a foreclosure on the collateral or insolvency proceedings, obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid in full with proceeds from the collateral prior to the obligations under the First Lien Notes.\nSecond Lien Notes\nIn December 2010, we issued $104.9 million aggregate principal amounts of senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 13.5% per annum, payable semi-annually, and mature in June 2018 (the \"Second Lien Notes\").\nDuring fiscal 2014, we exchanged approximately $94.3 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes for an equal aggregate principal amount of new second lien senior secured notes, which bear interest at a rate of 10.0% per annum, are payable in kind, and mature in June 2018 (the Second Lien PIK Notes\u201d). See \"Second Lien PIK Notes\" below. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately $0.6 million in aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes in the open market, from the Investors and exchanged approximately $7.8 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes for equity interests in the Parent pursuant to the debt for equity exchange agreement (as discussed below).\nDuring fiscal 2016, we redeemed the remaining $2.2 million in aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes at a price equal to 103.4% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon the full satisfaction and cancellation of all outstanding Second Lien Notes, the collateral agreement securing the Second Lien Notes was terminated and the obligations of the Company under the Indenture governing the Second Lien Notes were satisfied in full.\nThe Second Lien Notes were guaranteed on a second lien senior secured basis by the same subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee our Revolving Credit Facility and the First Lien Notes. The Second Lien Notes and the guarantees thereof were secured by a second-priority lien on substantially all our assets (subject to certain permitted liens and exceptions).\nNew Second Lien Notes\nIn January 2015, we issued approximately $39.0 million aggregate principal amount of New Second Lien Notes to the Investors, which bear interest at a rate of 7.0% per annum and mature in July 2020. Interest on the New Second Lien Notes is payable semi-annually on July 15th and January 15th of each year and is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30 day months. As described above, the New Second Lien Notes were issued in exchange for $32.0 million aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes pursuant to an exchange agreement.\nThe New Second Lien Notes were issued under a new indenture (the New Second Lien Notes Indenture\u201d), by and among American Media, Inc., certain of its subsidiaries listed as guarantors thereto (the \"Guarantors\") and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the \"Trustee\"). The New Second Lien Notes were issued through a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nIn March 2016, we issued approximately $159.6 million aggregate principal amount of additional New Second Lien Notes (the \"Additional New Second Lien Notes\"). Approximately $76.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Additional New Second Lien Notes were issued in exchange for approximately $58.9 million in aggregate principal amount of First Lien Notes pursuant to the New Second Lien Notes Exchange Agreement, as described above. Approximately $76.2 million in aggregate principal amount of Additional New Second Lien Notes were issued in a distribution to certain holders of equity interests in the Parent, of which approximately $68.8 million was issued to the Investors and approximately $7.4 million was issued to the Officer, and approximately $7.3 million aggregate principal amount of Additional New Second Lien Notes were issued to an affiliate of the Investors for cash.\nThe Additional New Second Lien Notes were issued under the existing New Second Lien Indenture through a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nAt March 31, 2016, the New Second Lien Notes represented an aggregate of $164.4 million of our indebtedness.\nThe New Second Lien Notes and the Additional New Second Lien Notes are guaranteed on a second lien senior secured basis by the same subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee our Revolving Credit Facility, the First Lien Notes and the Second Lien Notes. The New Second Lien Notes and the Additional New Second Lien Notes and the guarantees thereof are secured by a second-priority lien on substantially all our assets (subject to certain permitted liens and exceptions).\nSecond Lien PIK Notes\nDuring fiscal 2014, we issued approximately $94.3 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien PIK Notes in exchange for an equal aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes, pursuant to an exchange agreement (the \"Second Lien PIK Notes Exchange Agreement\"). The Second Lien PIK Notes were issued under an indenture (the \"Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture\"), by and among American Media, Inc., the Guarantors and Trustee.\nDuring fiscal 2015, in connection with the Merger Agreement, we issued approximately $12.3 million in aggregate principal amount of additional Second Lien PIK Notes (the \"Additional Second Lien PIK Notes\"). The Additional Second Lien PIK Notes were issued under the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture, were assigned the same CUSIP number as the outstanding Second Lien PIK Notes and were issued through a private offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nThe Second Lien PIK Notes were payable in kind at a rate of 10% per annum which totaled $4.8 million and $1.9 million, during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, and was recorded as an increase to the aggregate principal amount of Second Lien PIK Notes outstanding.\nIn September 2014, pursuant to the debt for equity exchange agreement with the Parent and the Investors, the Investors exchanged approximately $113.3 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien PIK Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, which represented all of the outstanding Second Lien PIK Notes, for equity interests in the Parent. Upon the cancellation of all outstanding Second Lien PIK Notes, the collateral agreement securing the Second Lien PIK Notes was terminated and the obligations of the Company under the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture were satisfied in full and the discharge thereof was acknowledged by the Trustee.\nDebt for Equity Conversion\nIn September 2014, AMI entered into the debt for equity exchange agreement with the Parent and the Investors, pursuant to which the Investors converted approximately $7.8 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes and all $113.3 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien PIK Notes into equity interests in the Parent (the Conversion\u201d). The Conversion also included the accrued and unpaid interest since the last semi-annual interest payment on June 15, 2014, totaling approximately $2.9 million.\nSupplemental Indentures\nIn August 2014, AMI received consents from the holders of (a) $218.2 million principal amount of the outstanding First Lien Notes to amend the indenture dated as of December 1, 2010 (as such agreement may be amended, restated or supplemented, the First Lien Notes Indenture\u201d), among AMI, the Guarantors and the Trustee, (b) $7.8 million principal amount of the outstanding Second Lien Notes to amend the indenture dated as of December 22, 2010 (as such agreement may be amended, restated or supplemented, the Second Lien Notes Indenture\u201d and, together with the First Lien Notes Indenture and the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture, the Indentures\u201d), among AMI, the Guarantors and the Trustee and (c) $101 million principal amount of the outstanding Second Lien PIK Notes to amend the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture, which in each case represented the requisite consents from holders of at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable notes then outstanding.\nAs a result of receiving the requisite consents, in August 2014, AMI and the Trustee entered into (a) the Fourth Supplemental Indenture (the First Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture\u201d) to the First Lien Notes Indenture, (b) the Third Supplemental Indenture (the Second Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture\u201d) to the Second Lien Notes Indenture and (c) the First Supplemental Indenture (the Second Lien PIK Notes Supplemental Indenture\u201d and, together with the First Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture and the Second Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture, the Supplemental Indentures\u201d) to the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture.\nThe Supplemental Indentures amend the Indentures to (a) permit the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement including amending the definition of Change of Control\u201d and permitting the issuance of the Additional Second Lien PIK Notes pursuant to the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture; and (b) in the case of the Second Lien PIK Notes Supplemental Indenture only, eliminate AMI's obligation to apply Cash Interest Savings (as defined in the Second Lien PIK Notes Indenture) to repurchase outstanding First Lien Notes for the semi-annual interest periods ending on June 15, 2014 and December 15, 2014 (collectively, the Amendments\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Supplemental Indentures, the Supplemental Indentures became effective, and the Amendments became operative, immediately upon execution of the Supplemental Indentures.\nIn January 2015, we entered into a supplemental indenture (the 2015 Supplemental Indenture\u201d) by and between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as successor by merger to Wilmington Trust FSB, as trustee and collateral agent (collectively, the Existing Second Lien Trustee\u201d), to an indenture, dated as of December 22, 2010, by and among the Company, the guarantors party thereto and the Existing Second Lien Trustee (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified through the date of amendment, the Existing Second Lien Indenture\u201d). The 2015 Supplemental Indenture contemplates, among other things, the exchange of First Lien Notes for the New Second Lien Notes.\nIn March 2016, the Company received consents from the holders of (a) $266.1 million principal amount of the outstanding First Lien Notes to amend the indenture dated as of December 1, 2010 (as such agreement may be amended, restated or supplemented, the First Lien Notes Indenture\u201d), among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee and (b) $39.0 million principal amount of the outstanding New Second Lien Notes to amend the indenture dated as of January 20, 2015 (as such agreement may be amended, restated or supplemented, the New Second Lien Notes Indenture\u201d and, together with the First Lien Notes Indenture, the Indentures\u201d), among the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee, which in each case represented the requisite consents from holders of at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding.\nAs a result of receiving the requisite consents, in March 2016, the Company and the Trustee entered into (a) the Fifth Supplemental Indenture (the First Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture\u201d) to the First Lien Notes Indenture and (b) the First Supplemental Indenture (the New Second Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture\u201d and, together with the First Lien Notes Supplemental Indenture, the Supplemental Indentures\u201d). The Supplemental Indentures amend the First Lien Indenture and the New Second Lien Indenture, as applicable, to, among other things, permit the issuance of the Additional New Second Lien Notes.\nThe Indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes contain certain affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default. For example, the Indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes contain covenants that limit our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries, subject to important exceptions and qualifications, to: borrow money; guarantee other indebtedness; use assets as security in other transactions; pay dividends on stock, redeem stock or redeem subordinated debt; make investments; enter into agreements that restrict the payment of dividends by subsidiaries; sell assets; enter into affiliate transactions; sell capital stock of subsidiaries; enter into new lines of business; and merge or consolidate. In addition, the Indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes impose certain requirements as to future subsidiary guarantors.\nAs of March 31, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes.\nCovenant Compliance\nAs discussed above, our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes contain various restrictive covenants. With regard to our Revolving Credit Facility, the financial covenants are comprised of a first lien leverage ratio, a consolidated leverage rate and an interest coverage ratio.\nThe first lien leverage ratio covenant is calculated as the Total First Lien Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) and must be equal to or less than 3.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017, the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. The consolidated leverage ratio covenant is calculated as the Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) and must be equal to or less than 5.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017, the maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility. The interest coverage ratio covenant is calculated as the Consolidated EBITDA to Cash Interest Expense (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) and must be equal to or greater than 1.50 to 1.00 from January 1, 2016 through June 2017, maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility.\nAs of March 31, 2016, the first lien leverage ratio was 3.05 to 1.00, the consolidated leverage ratio was 5.23 to 1.00 and the interest coverage ratio was 2.06 to 1.00 and the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Second Notes.\nAlthough there can be no assurances, management believes that, based on current expectations (including projected borrowings and repayments under the Revolving Credit Facility and our recent debt initiatives), our operating results for the next twelve months will be sufficient to satisfy the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility. Our ability to satisfy such financial covenant is dependent on our business performing in accordance with our projections. If the performance of our business deviates from our projections, we may not be able to satisfy such financial covenants. Our projections are subject to a number of factors, many of which are events beyond our control, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from our projections (see \"Risk Factors\" included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report). If we do not comply with our financial covenants, we would be in default under the Revolving Credit Facility, which could result in all our debt being accelerated due to cross-default provisions in the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes.\nWe have the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations imposed by our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes. Under our Revolving Credit Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes, in addition to specified permitted indebtedness, we will be able to incur additional indebtedness as long as on a pro forma basis our consolidated leverage ratio is less than 5.50 to 1.00.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA, a measure we use to gauge our operating performance, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to the Company plus interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, provision for impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, deferred financing costs and deferred rack costs, adjusted for merger and related transaction(s) costs, restructuring costs and severance, costs related to launches, re-launches or closures of publications and certain other costs. We believe that the inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to evaluate our operating performance compared to our operating plans and/or prior years and to value prospective acquisitions. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends because Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of certain items that can differ significantly from company to company, depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments.\nManagement believes our investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a gauge to measure the performance of their investment in the Company. Management compensates for limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures by using them to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP results alone can provide. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to income from continuing operations as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow available for management's discretionary use as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to American Media, Inc. and subsidiaries to Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS\nThe following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of March 31, 2016:\n\n\nSEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS\nOur business has always experienced seasonality, which we expect will continue, due to advertising patterns based on consumer reading habits. Fluctuations in quarterly performance are also due to variations in our publication schedule and variability of audience traffic on our websites. Not all of our publications are published on a regular schedule throughout the year. Additionally, the publication schedule for our special interest publications can vary and lead to quarterly fluctuations in our operating results.\nAdvertising revenue from our magazines and websites is typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter due to our health and fitness magazines. During our fourth fiscal quarter, which begins on January 1st, advertisers and consumers are focused on the \"New Year and New You.\" Certain newsstand costs vary from quarter to quarter, particularly marketing costs associated with the distribution of our magazines.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions regarding uncertainties that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to revenue, trade receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes and contingent liabilities.\nWe base our estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and other relevant factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates, judgments and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\nCritical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company's financial position and results of operations, and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The following accounting policies and estimates are those that management deems most critical. For a complete listing of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Revenues and associated accounts receivable are recorded net of provisions for estimated future returns, doubtful accounts and other allowances. Allowances for uncollectible receivables are estimated based upon a combination of write-off history, aging analysis and any specifically identified troubled accounts.\nNewsstand revenues are recognized based on the on-sale dates of magazines and are initially recorded based upon estimates of sales, net of brokerage, returns and estimates of newsstand related fees. Estimated returns are recorded based upon historical experience.\nPrint advertising revenues are recorded based on the on-sale dates of magazines when the advertisement appears in the magazine and are stated net of agency commissions and cash and sales discounts. Digital advertising revenues on the Company's websites are generally based on the sale of impression-based advertisements, which are recorded in the period in which the advertisements are served.\nOther revenues, primarily from licensing opportunities and strategic partnerships for our branded products as well as marketing services performed for third parties by DSI, are recognized when the service is performed.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company's goodwill and related indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate a potential impairment exists. Impairment losses, if any, are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated financial statements. The Company's reporting units consist of each of its publications and other consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe Company reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value. Impairment losses, if any, are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated financial statements.\nIn assessing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment, the Company makes estimates of fair value that are based on its projection of revenues, operating costs and cash flows of each reporting unit, considering historical and anticipated future results and general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies. The valuations employ a combination of income and market approaches to measure fair value. Changes in management's judgments and projections or assumptions used could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could materially change the impairment charge related to goodwill and tradenames. For a detailed description of impairment charges, see Note 3, Goodwill and Other Identified Intangible Assets.\u201d\nThe Company did not record any impairment charges during fiscal 2016. The Company continues to evaluate goodwill and other identified intangible assets for impairment. Goodwill and other identified intangible assets are material components of the Company's financial statements and impairment charges to the Company's goodwill or other identified intangible assets in future periods could be material to the Company's results of operations.\nDuring an evaluation of goodwill and other identified intangible assets during fiscal 2015 (at September 30, 2014), the Company determined that indicators were present in certain reporting units which would suggest the fair value of the reporting unit may have declined below the carrying value. This decline was primarily due to the continuing softness in the consumer magazine sector, which impacts consumer and advertising spending, including further declines in certain advertising markets, resulting in lowered future cash flow projections.\nAs a result, an interim impairment test of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets was performed during fiscal 2015 for certain reporting units in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic No. 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d ( ASC 350\u201d). Impairment testing for goodwill is a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment charge, if any. The second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. Impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible assets, consisting of tradenames, compares the fair value of the tradename to the carrying value and an impairment charge is recorded for any excess carrying value over fair value.\nThe evaluation resulted in the carrying value of goodwill and tradenames for certain reporting units to exceed the estimated fair value. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $8.9 million and $8.5 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and tradenames, respectively, during fiscal 2015.\nAs of March 31, 2016, we identified three reporting units with an excess fair value over carrying value of less than 25%. As of March 31, 2016, National Enquirer, Flex and Muscle & Fitness reporting units had goodwill balances of $59.0 million, $5.4 million and $13.4 million, respectively. For all other reporting units, the fair value is substantially in excess of carrying value as of March 31, 2016. While historical performance and current expectations have resulted in fair values of the reporting units in excess of carrying values, if our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in the future additional impairment charges may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material. The Company will continue to monitor the recoverability of its remaining goodwill.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of interim or annual goodwill impairment tests will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of the aforementioned reporting units may include such items as follows:\n \u2022 A prolonged downturn in the business environment in which the reporting units operate (i.e. circulation and advertising decreases) especially in the markets we serve; \n \u2022 An economic recovery that significantly differs from our assumptions in timing or degree; \n \u2022 Volatility in debt markets resulting in higher discount rates; and \n \u2022 Unexpected regulatory changes for our advertisers. \nIf our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that in the future an impairment charge may need to be recorded. However, it is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result or if such a charge would be material.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. When such factors, events or circumstances indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of the assets to measure recoverability. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds fair value computed on a discounted cash flow basis.\nThe Company did not record any impairment charges for long-lived tangible and intangible assets during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes requires a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on any changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income.\nRECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity (Topic 205 and Topic 360) (\"ASU 2014-08\") which raises the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations. Under this new guidance, a discontinued operation is (1) a component of an entity or group of components that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale that represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results or (2) an acquired business that is classified as held for sale on the acquisition date. This guidance also requires expanded or new disclosures for discontinued operations, individually material disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation, an entity's continuing involvement with a discontinued operation following disposal, and retained equity method investments in a discontinued operation. ASU 2014-08 was effective for the Company on April 1, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-08 did not have an impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (\"ASU 2015-17\"), which simplifies the presentation of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The new guidance no longer requires the presentation of current deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on a classified balance sheet, rather requiring all to be presented as non-current. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company prospectively adopted this guidance in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. As required by this guidance, all deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which is a change from our historical presentation wherein certain of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were classified as current and the remainder were classified as non-current. The March 31, 2015 balance sheet has not been retrospectively adjusted. As this guidance impacts presentation only, the adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have an impact on the results of operations or cash flows.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Topic 205) (\"ASU 2014-15\"), which establishes management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and setting rules for how this information should be disclosed in the financial statements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual period beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company has not determined the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20) (\"ASU 2015-01\"), which simplifies the income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidations, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (Topic 810) (\"ASU 2015-02\"), which changes the identification of variable interests, the variable interest characteristic for a limited partnership or similar entity and the primary beneficiary determination all of which are intended to improve the consolidation guidance as well as increase transparency and consistency of financial reporting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued a proposal for a one-year deferral of the effective date for ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASU 2014-09\"). Under this proposal, the standard would be effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. As a result of the one-year deferral, ASU 2014-09 will now be effective for the Company on April 1, 2018 using one of two retrospective application methods. The Company has not determined the potential effects on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (Subtopic 835-30) (\"ASU 2015-03\"), which requires the presentation of debt issuance costs to be reflected as a reduction from the face amount of the related debt, with amortization recorded as interest expense, rather than recording as a deferred asset. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2015, and requires retrospective application. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although it will change the financial statement classification of the deferred financing cost. As of March 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had $8.1 million and $6.4 million of net deferred financing costs, respectively, included on the consolidated balance sheets. Under the new guidance, the net deferred financing costs would offset the carrying amount of the respective debt on the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330) (\"ASU 2015-11\"), which simplifies the measurement of inventory by requiring certain inventory to be subsequently measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim period within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements-Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting, to clarify that an entity may elect to present debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset, regardless of whether or not there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d), which requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months and disclose certain information about the leasing arrangements. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and the interim periods within those years, beginning on or after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption.", "item_7_tables": "Table 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
