Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains forward-looking statements\u201d - that is, statements related to future, not past, events. In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d believe,\u201d seek,\u201d see,\u201d will,\u201d would,\u201d or target.\u201d Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain.\nFor us, particular risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements include:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the effects of competition in the businesses in which we operate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in client demand and our ability to provide products and services on terms that are favorable to us;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in law, economic and financial conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the impacts of breaches or potential breaches of network, information technology or data security, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war or significant litigation and any resulting financial impact not covered by insurance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the effectiveness of our risk management framework;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the impact of regulation and regulatory, investigative and legal proceedings and legal compliance risks, including the impact of financial services regulation and litigation and potential SEC or DOL regulations impacting third-party distributors of mutual funds;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our investments in funds and other companies may decline;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the risk that the proposed Merger with SS&C will not be consummated within the expected time period or at all, including the risk that the Company may be unable to obtain stockholder approval as required for the Merger and conditions to the closing of the Merger may not be satisfied or waived on a timely basis or otherwise;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the risk that a governmental entity or a regulatory body may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the Merger and may require conditions, limitations or restrictions in connection with such approvals that can adversely affect the anticipated benefits of the proposed Merger or cause the parties to abandon the proposed Merger;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the risk that the business of the Company may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the Merger or the potential adverse changes to business relationships resulting from the proposed Merger;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the risk that the Merger may involve unexpected costs, liabilities or delays;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the risk that legal proceedings may be initiated related to the Merger and the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the Merger may be adverse to the Company; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the other factors that are described in Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese or other uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements. This document includes certain forward-looking projected financial information that is based on current estimates and forecasts. Actual results could differ materially.\nFuture economic and industry trends that could potentially impact our financial statements or results of operations are difficult to predict. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of the date of this report. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized, except as may be required by law.\nIntroduction\nDST Systems, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries use proprietary software applications to provide sophisticated information processing and servicing solutions through strategically unified data management and business process solutions to clients globally within the asset management, brokerage, retirement, healthcare and other markets. Our wholly-owned data centers provide the secure technology infrastructure necessary to support our solutions. In order to position the Company to take advantage of new and emerging technologies, we are embarking on an information technology transformation effort which will increase our operating expenses for the near term. We expect these investments will result in lower centralized infrastructure costs and a more agile platform on which to deliver future capabilities.\nOn January 11, 2018, we entered into a Merger Agreement wherein SS&C will acquire DST. Under the terms of the agreement, SS&C will purchase DST in an all-cash transaction for $84.00 per share plus the assumption of debt, equating to an enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion. We have agreed to customary covenants in the Merger Agreement, including with respect to the operation of our business prior to the closing of the transaction or termination of the agreement, such as\nrestrictions on making certain acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and expenditures, paying dividends, repurchasing stock and taking other specified actions. The transaction is subject to DST stockholder approval, clearances by the relevant regulatory authorities and other customary closing conditions and is currently expected to close by the end of the second quarter 2018; however, there can be no assurances as to the actual closing or the timing of the closing. Consummation of the proposed Merger would constitute a change of control of DST under the partnership agreement of IFDS L.P. and, as a result, the other partner would have the option to purchase our interests in IFDS L.P. at a price equal to book value, unless another purchase provision in the partnership agreement was triggered prior to the change of control.\nIn March 2017, we acquired State Street's ownership interests in our joint ventures BFDS and IFDS U.K., as well as other investments and real estate held by IFDS L.P. The BFDS acquisition was effectuated through a non-taxable exchange of our State Street common stock with a fair value of $163.4 million for State Street's ownership interest in BFDS. We also acquired State Street's ownership interest in IFDS U.K., and IFDS L.P.'s ownership in IFDS Percana and IFDS Realty U.K. for total cash consideration of $234.9 million.\nIn May 2017, we completed the sale of our U.K. Customer Communications business for cash consideration of $43.6 million. We recorded a pretax gain of $2.6 million on the sale during 2017. We sold our North American Customer Communications business for cash consideration of $410.7 million on July 1, 2016 and we recorded a pretax gain of $341.5 million on the sale in 2016. We have classified the results of the businesses sold as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. The net after-tax proceeds from these sales are being used in accordance with the Company's capital plan, including investments in the business, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, debt repayments and other corporate purposes, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Merger Agreement with SS&C.\nBeginning in 2017, DST established a new reportable segment structure that reflects how management is now operating the business and making resource allocations following the acquisitions of IFDS U.K. and BFDS, as well as the recent reductions in non-core investment assets. The Company's operating business units are now reported as three operating segments (Domestic Financial Services, International Financial Services and Healthcare Services). Prior periods have been revised to reflect the new reportable operating segments.\nDomestic Financial Services Segment\nThrough the Domestic Financial Services segment, we provide investor, investment, advisor/intermediary and asset distribution services to companies within the U.S. financial services industry. Utilizing our proprietary software applications, we offer our clients information processing solutions that enable them to capture, analyze and report their investors' transactions including direct and intermediary sales of mutual funds, alternative investments, securities brokerage accounts and retirement plans. Examples of the services we provide include tracking of purchases, redemptions, exchanges and transfers of shares; maintaining investor identification and ownership records; reconciling cash and share activity; processing dividends; reporting sales; and performing tax and other compliance functions. We also support full reporting to investors for confirmations, statements and tax forms, web access, and electronic delivery of documents.\nServices are provided either on a Remote or BPO basis utilizing our proprietary software applications. Our BPO service offerings are enhanced by our proprietary workflow software, which is also licensed separately to third parties.\nDomestic Financial Services fees are primarily charged to the client based on the number of accounts, participants or transactions processed. For subaccounts, a portion of the services we provide for registered accounts are provided directly by the broker/dealer. As a result, our revenue per account is generally higher for registered accounts than for subaccounts. On a more limited basis, we also generate revenue through asset-based fee arrangements and from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in our full service transfer agency bank accounts. We typically have multi-year agreements with our clients. We are continuing to monitor changes in the financial services industry, including the shift from direct products to fee-based platforms which could reduce the number of direct mutual fund registered accounts we service.\nIn December 2017, we entered into a ten year contract with a new client to provide both mutual fund and retirement servicing solutions. Based on current volumes, the client is expected to convert approximately 2.0 million registered accounts and 0.3 million retirement accounts onto our platforms during mid to late 2019. This new client currently performs their processing in-house and in order to assist the new client with covering the costs to transition to our platforms we have agreed to pay them $13.0 million in transition assistance during the conversion, of which $2.0 million was paid in December 2017. The total amounts will be amortized as a reduction to revenue over the course of the ten year contractual term.\nAdditionally in December 2017, we renewed our largest Domestic Financial Services client to a new seven year contract. Based upon our new rate structure, we expect our operating revenue in 2018 associated with this client to be relatively consistent with the 2017 revenue.\nAs part of the continuing strategic review of our operations, we decided not to renew a long-term surety bond insurance agreement which expired in December 2017 as the proposed revised terms were no longer economically advantageous. This agreement historically generated approximately $14.0 million of annual revenue.\nOn February 24, 2016, we acquired all of the membership interests of Kaufman Rossin Fund Services LLC ( KRFS\u201d), an independent, full-service provider of specialized hedge fund administration services to the global financial community. KRFS' hedge fund services include accounting and valuation, back-office outsourcing, investor services, treasury services, and customized reporting.\nDuring 2015, we acquired all of the membership interests of kasina LLC, a strategic advisory firm to the asset management industry, and Red Rocks Capital LLC, an asset manager which focuses on listed private equity and other private asset investments. In 2015, we also acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Wealth Management Systems Inc., a provider of technology-based rollover services in the retirement marketplace.\nIn December 2015, we entered into a ten year contract with a new client to provide both subaccounting and mutual fund servicing solutions. The client converted approximately 10.0 million subaccounts onto our platform during 2016 and converted approximately 2.6 million registered accounts onto our platform during the third quarter of 2017.\nInternational Financial Services Segment\nWe offer investor and policyholder administration and technology services on a Remote and BPO basis in the U.K. and, through our joint venture IFDS L.P., in Canada, Ireland, and Luxembourg. Additionally, in Australia and in the U.K., we provide solutions related to participant accounting and recordkeeping for wealth management, wrap platforms\u201d and retirement savings ( superannuation\u201d) industries/markets through use of our wealth management platform and our life and pension administration system.\nOur primary clients are mutual fund managers, insurers and platform providers. International Financial Services fees are primarily charged to the client based on the number of accounts or transactions processed. We also realize revenues from fixed-fee license agreements that include provisions for ongoing support and maintenance and for additional license payments in the event that usage increases. Additionally, we derive professional service revenues from fees for implementation services, custom programming and data center operations. We typically have multi-year agreements with our clients.\nIn November 2016, we sold a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary that provides water billing software and services solutions for cash consideration of approximately $6.1 million. This business had approximately $5.4 million of operating revenue and $1.2 million of operating income on an annual basis. As these decisions were the result of a tactical review of our products and services, and not the result of a significant shift in strategic direction, the revenue and operating income from these products and services are included within our continuing operations.\nDuring 2017, we reached a termination agreement with a wealth management platform client who had engaged us for a multi-year development and implementation effort as well as post-implementation services. The termination agreement resulted in incremental operating revenues of $93.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as we accelerated recognition of previously deferred revenue and recognized termination payments received. Additionally, our International Financial Services segment has been notified that two of our clients, which have collectively contributed approximately $33.0 million of annual revenue, will be migrating off our FAST platform in stages through the end of 2018.\nHealthcare Services Segment\nThe Healthcare Services segment uses our proprietary software applications to provide healthcare organizations a variety of medical and pharmacy benefit solutions to satisfy their information processing, quality of care, cost management concerns and payment integrity programs, while achieving compliance and improving operational efficiencies. Our healthcare solutions include claims adjudication, benefit management, care management, business intelligence and other ancillary services. We also continue to expand and enhance our Healthcare Services' offerings to ensure we are able to address the changing needs of our clients within the complex and highly regulated health industries which we serve. For example, our pharmacy management business continues to make investments to expand our clinical, network, and analytic capabilities to help our clients and prospective clients achieve the best possible outcomes for their members and to allow us to more effectively compete in the broader competitive pharmacy benefit manager ( PBM\u201d) market. Historically, we have acted as an agent within our pharmacy-solutions business and, accordingly, recognized revenue on a net basis. As our enhanced products evolve and we expand our pharmacy-solutions service offerings, we will evaluate the provisions within our new pharmacy network and client contracts to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent in the transactions. If we determine that we are acting as a principal in the transactions, we will report the transactions on a gross basis, resulting in significantly higher revenues and costs reflected within our consolidated financial statements.\nWe generally derive revenue from our pharmacy-solutions business on a transactional fee basis. Fees are earned on pharmacy claims processing and payments services, pharmacy and member call center services, pharmaceutical rebate administration, administration or management of clinical programs, pharmacy network management, member and plan web services and management information and reporting. Further, revenues include investment earnings related to client cash balances maintained in our bank accounts. Medical claim processing revenues are generally derived from fees charged on a per member/per month basis or transactional basis. We also realize revenue from fixed-fee license agreements that include provisions for ongoing support and maintenance and for additional license payments in the event that usage or members increase. Additionally, we derive professional service revenues from fees for implementation services, custom programming and data center operations.\nDuring 2017, we renewed our pharmacy services contract with our Healthcare Services segment's third largest client extending the term of the contract through December 31, 2020. As previously announced, two of our Healthcare Services clients transitioned their services off our systems during 2017. Additionally, we have been notified that one of our largest Healthcare Services clients, which contributed approximately $50.0 million of annual revenue, will be migrating off our medical claims processing platform in stages through the end of 2019.\nSeasonality\nGenerally, we do not have significant seasonal fluctuations in our business operations. Processing volumes for mutual fund clients within our Domestic and International Financial Services segment are usually highest during the quarter ended March 31 due primarily to processing year-end transactions during January. We have historically added operating equipment in the last half of the year in preparation for processing year-end transactions, which has the effect of increasing costs for the second half of the year. Revenues and operating results from individual license sales vary depending on the timing and size of the contracts.\nNew Authoritative Accounting Guidance\nSee Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies - New authoritative accounting guidance.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: revenue recognition; software capitalization and amortization; depreciation of fixed assets; valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill; accounting for investments; and accounting for income taxes.\nRevenue recognition\nWe recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and it is earned. The majority of our revenues are derived from computer processing and services and are recognized upon completion of the services provided. Software license fees, maintenance fees and other ancillary fees are recognized as services are provided or delivered and all client obligations have been met. We generally do not have payment terms from clients that extend beyond one year. Billing for services in advance of performance is recorded as deferred revenue.\nWe recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured. If there is a client-specific acceptance provision in a contract or if there is uncertainty about client acceptance, the associated revenue is deferred until we have evidence of client acceptance.\nRevenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables (items) can be divided into more than one unit of accounting. An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: 1) the delivered item(s) has value to the client on a standalone basis and 2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. Once separate units of accounting are determined, the arrangement consideration\nshould be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence, which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from third-party evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items. If such evidence is unavailable, we use our best estimate of the selling price, which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.\nWe derive over 90% of our revenues as a result of providing processing and services under contracts. The majority of our fees are billed on a monthly basis, generally with thirty-day collection terms. Revenues are recognized for monthly processing and services upon performance of the services.\nOur standard business practice is to bill monthly for development, consulting and training services on a time and materials basis. In some cases we bill a fixed fee for development and consulting services. For fixed fee arrangements, we recognize revenue on a proportionate performance\u201d basis. We periodically provide upfront cash payments to our clients to assist with the significant upfront costs associated with converting to new systems. Such payments are treated as a reduction of revenue over the term of the related contract.\nWe derive less than 10% of our revenues from licensing products. We license our wealth management products, life and pension administration system, AWD products and healthcare administration processing software solutions. Perpetual software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed, the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist. Deferral of software license revenue billed results from delayed payment provisions, disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services. Term software license revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the license agreement. While license fee revenues are not a significant percentage of our total operations, they can significantly impact earnings in the period in which they are recognized. Revenues from individual license sales depend heavily on the timing, size and nature of the contract. We recognize revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term, after collectability has been reasonably assured.\nWe may enter into arrangements with broker/dealers or other third parties to sell or market closed-end fund shares. Depending on the arrangement, we may earn distribution fees for marketing and selling the underlying fund shares. Conversely, we may incur distribution expenses, including structuring fees, finders' fees and referral fees paid to unaffiliated broker/dealers or introducing parties for marketing and selling underlying fund shares of a closed-end fund we sponsor. While distribution revenues and expenses are not significant percentages of our operating revenues or costs and expenses, they can significantly impact operations and earnings in the period in which they are recognized.\nWe have entered into various agreements with related parties, principally unconsolidated affiliates, under which we have historically provided data processing and software services. We believe that the terms of our contracts with related parties are fair to us and are no less favorable than those obtained from unaffiliated parties.\nWe assess collection based on a variety of factors, including past collection history with the client and the credit-worthiness of the client. We generally do not request collateral from our client. If we determine that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred and is recognized at the time it becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. Allowances for billing adjustments and bad debt expense are estimated as revenues are recognized. Allowances for billing adjustments are recorded as reductions in revenues and bad debt expense is recorded within Costs and expenses. The annual amounts for these items are generally immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.\nSoftware capitalization and amortization\nWe make substantial investments in software to enhance the functionality and facilitate the delivery of our processing services as well as our sale of licensed products. Purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years. We develop a large portion of our software internally. We capitalize software development costs for computer software developed or obtained for internal use after the preliminary project phase has been completed and management has committed to funding the project. For computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed to third parties, we capitalize software development costs which are incurred after the products reach technological feasibility but prior to the general release of the product to clients. The capitalized software development costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining what projects and costs associated with software development will be capitalized and in assigning estimated economic lives to the completed projects. Management specifically evaluates software development projects and analyzes the percentage of completion as compared to the initial plan and subsequent forecasts, milestones achieved and the commitment to continue funding the projects. Significant changes in any of these items may result in discontinuing capitalization of development costs, as well as immediately expensing previously capitalized costs. We review, on a quarterly basis, our capitalized software for possible impairment.\nDepreciation of fixed assets\nFor personal property, we generally prefer to own rather than lease the property when practicable. We believe this approach provides us with better flexibility for disposing or redeploying the asset as it nears the completion of its economic life. We depreciate technology equipment using accelerated depreciation methods over the following lives: (1) non-mainframe equipment-three years; (2) mainframe central processing unit-four years; and (3) mainframe direct access storage devices-five years. We depreciate furniture and fixtures over estimated useful lives, principally three to five years, using accelerated depreciation methods. We depreciate leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or life of the improvements. Management judgment is required in assigning economic lives to fixed assets. Management specifically analyzes fixed asset additions, remaining net book values and gain/loss upon disposition of fixed assets to determine the appropriateness of assigned economic lives. Significant changes in any of these items may result in changes in the economic life assigned and the resulting depreciation expense.\nValuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment. We evaluate the impairment of goodwill at least annually (as of October 1) and evaluate identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following: significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our strategy for the overall business; and significant negative industry or economic trends. When it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we assess actual impairment based on cash flows.\nOur assessment of goodwill for impairment may first include a qualitative assessment that considers various factors, including those described above as well as growth in operating revenues and income from operations of our reporting units since our last quantitative assessment. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if a qualitative assessment is not performed.\nOur quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment includes comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value, including goodwill. We estimate fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market approaches. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. After a goodwill impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill becomes its new accounting basis.\nOur 2017, 2016 and 2015 annual goodwill impairment tests determined that goodwill was not impaired, except during 2016 for the goodwill held at the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit, which is included as a component of discontinued operations, as further described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data - Note 4, Discontinued Operations.\u201d\nAccounting for investments\nWe have four significant types of investments: 1) investments in available-for-sale securities; 2) investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are comprised principally of IFDS L.P. and certain real estate joint ventures; 3) investments in private equity funds and other investments accounted for under the cost method; and 4) seed capital investments accounted for at fair value.\nWe account for investments in entities in which we own less than 20% and do not have significant influence in accordance with authoritative guidance related to accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, which requires us to designate our investments as trading or available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to Accumulated other comprehensive income within Stockholders' equity.\nWe regularly review investment securities for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds fair value, the duration of any market decline, and the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer. We record an investment impairment charge for an investment with a gross unrealized holding loss resulting from a decline in value that is other than temporary. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment's current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on our financial position.\nThe equity method of accounting is used for investments in entities, partnerships and similar interests (including investments in private equity funds where we are the limited partner) in which we have significant influence but do not control. We classify\nthese investments as unconsolidated affiliates. Under the equity method, we recognize income or losses from our pro-rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates' net income or loss, which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate. In certain cases, pro-rata losses are recognized only to the extent of our investment and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate.\nThe cost method of accounting is used for these investments when we have a de minimis ownership percentage and do not have significant influence. Our cost method investments are held at the lower of cost or market.\nAccounting for income taxes\nWe account for income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof).\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), resulting in significant modifications to existing U.S. tax law, including but not limited to, (1) lowering the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018; (2) eliminating the domestic production activity deduction; (3) implementing a territorial tax system; and (4) imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) which provides additional clarification in situations where we do not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act for the reporting period in which the Tax Act was enacted. We have recognized the provisional tax impacts, based on reasonable estimates, related to the one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through the year ended December 31, 2017 ( Transition Tax\u201d) and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and has included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act. We intend to complete our accounting under the Tax Act within the measurement period set forth in SAB 118.\nIn addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for potential tax exposures based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be required. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, then we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained if challenged by the taxing authorities. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given period may be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require cash payments and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. We report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions within income tax expense.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results (in millions).

</tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nConsolidated total revenues (including out-of-pocket ( OOP\u201d) reimbursements) increased $661.5 million or 42.5% during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 and increased $82.7 million or 5.6% during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Consolidated operating revenues increased $612.3 million or 41.5% in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K. in 2017 which collectively contributed $601.8 million of incremental operating revenue during 2017. Consolidated operating revenues increased $69.4 million or 4.9% in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily as a result of the acquisitions of KRFS in February 2016, Red Rocks Capital LLC in July 2015 and Wealth Management Systems Inc. in August 2015.\nPrior to the acquisitions of BFDS and IFDS U.K., we received revenues for processing services and products provided under agreements with these entities. Our operating revenues derived from sales to these entities were $138.5 million and $134.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and $35.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The operating results of BFDS and IFDS U.K. were consolidated within our operating results subsequent to the acquisition dates.\nConsolidated OOP reimbursements increased $49.2 million or 59.8% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased $13.3 million or 19.3% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in consolidated OOP reimbursements in 2017 is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K. The increase in consolidated OOP reimbursements in 2016 is primarily attributable to increased client volumes in the Domestic Financial Services segment.\nCosts and expenses\nConsolidated costs and expenses (including OOP reimbursements) increased $591.6 million or 48.8% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased $63.2 million or 5.5% in 2016 as compared to 2015. Costs and expenses are primarily comprised of compensation and benefit costs, reimbursable operating expenses, information technology spend and professional fees. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $131.5 million, $82.3 million and $69.0 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding reimbursable operating expenses, costs and expenses increased $542.4 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased $49.9 million in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nThe increase in costs and expenses in 2017, exclusive of reimbursable expenses, is primarily attributable to the consolidation of BFDS and IFDS U.K. following the acquisitions of the remaining interests in these entities during 2017. Share-based compensation expense increased $31.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily driven by the prior year reversal of accrued performance-related share-based compensation expense as 2015 PSUs were not expected to achieve the required performance criteria combined with increased share-based compensation expense in 2017 related to 2016 and 2017 PSUs that are currently expected to vest at a higher conversion rate than target. In addition, we recorded increased bad debt expense and a significant charitable contribution transaction in 2017.\nAs a result of changes in our business environment, including the transition of certain Health Services clients off of our systems, the termination of a wealth management client in the International Financial Services segment, and the acquisitions of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K., we have implemented restructuring initiatives to right-size our organization and enhance operational efficiencies, as well as achieve synergies from our recent acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred pretax restructuring charges primarily related to employee terminations and related costs of $23.4 million in Costs and expenses. Annualized savings achieved from the actions taken from March 2017 through October 2017 are currently expected to be approximately $22.0 million within the Domestic Financial Services segment, approximately $7.0 million within the International Financial Services segment and approximately $13.0 million within the Healthcare Services segment.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $10.4 million and $3.4 million of pretax restructuring charges, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization\nConsolidated depreciation and amortization increased $32.0 million or 33.3% during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of the acquisitions of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K. and increased $4.9 million or 5.4% during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the acquisition of KRFS.\nOperating income\nConsolidated operating income increased $37.9 million or 15.3% to $285.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased $14.6 million or 6.3% to $247.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense was $26.8 million, $23.5 million and $23.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense increased 14.0% during 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to higher borrowings as a result of the acquisition of IFDS U.K. and higher borrowing rates on the $350.0 million of debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2017. Interest expense decreased 1.3% during 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily from lower weighted average debt balances outstanding.\nGain on sale of business\nOn November 1, 2016, we sold DST Billing Solutions Limited ( Billing Solutions\u201d) for cash consideration of approximately $6.1 million. Operating revenue and income generated for the Billing Solutions business sold was approximately $4.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016. We recorded a pretax gain of $5.5 million on the sale of the business during 2016.\nOther income, net\nThe components of other income, net are as follows (in millions):\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains from the disposition of available-for-sale securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on previously held equity interests\n</td> <td>43.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on private equity funds and other investments\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend income\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Miscellaneous items\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>204.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncluded in the net realized gains from the disposition of available-for-sale securities during 2015 were gains of $157.3 million from the sale of approximately 2.3 million shares of State Street common stock as compared to no sales of State Street shares during 2016. We recognized a realized gain of $145.1 million from the exchange of State Street common stock for the remaining interests in BFDS in 2017. We also recognized a realized gain of $10.4 million from the charitable contribution of our remaining State Street shares in 2017. Additionally, as a result of the 2017 acquisitions, we recorded a net pretax gain of $43.8 million on the step-up of our previous 50% ownership interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K. during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe recorded a net gain on private equity funds and other investments of $15.4 million, $16.5 million and $35.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to distributions received from certain of our private equity fund investments resulting in realized gains. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments and may require an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on our net income.\nWe receive dividend income from certain investments held. The decline in dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by our reduction of our investment in State Street common stock in March 2017. Dividends received from State Street common stock were $0.1 million, $3.1 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is as follows (in millions):\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International Financial Data Services U.K.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International Financial Data Services L.P.\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Boston Financial Data Services, Inc.\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other unconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>31.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEquity in earnings of IFDS U.K. decreased $9.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily as a result of the discontinuation of equity method accounting subsequent to our acquisition of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. Equity in earnings of IFDS U.K. decreased $12.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily attributable to lower revenues recognized related to client conversion activities and higher operating costs as IFDS U.K. expanded its infrastructure to address increasing regulatory, compliance and security needs.\nEquity in earnings of IFDS L.P. increased $16.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily as a result of $10.2 million of realized gains on the step-up of certain investments and real estate assets that were distributed from the joint venture to DST and State Street immediately prior to the acquisitions by DST of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. and BFDS. Equity in earnings of IFDS L.P. decreased $5.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015.\nEquity in earnings of BFDS decreased $4.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily as a result of the discontinuation of equity method accounting subsequent to the acquisition of the remaining interests in BFDS in March 2017. Equity in earnings of BFDS increased $3.0 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to higher ancillary and non-operating revenues as well as a reduction in operating costs.\nOur equity in earnings of other unconsolidated affiliates was $31.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $24.9 million as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $23.0 million increase resulting from a gain on the step-up of real estate distributed from Broadway Square Partners, LLP ( Broadway Square Partners\u201d), an unconsolidated affiliate, during 2017. Our equity in earnings of other unconsolidated affiliates was $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $3.5 million as compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $3.6 million gain resulting from the sale of real estate by an unconsolidated affiliate during 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately $40.8 million of our consolidated retained earnings represents undistributed earnings in our unconsolidated affiliates accounted for by the equity method of accounting.\nIncome taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 15.8%, 36.2% and 32.5% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our income tax rate for 2017 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the non-taxable nature of the BFDS exchange transaction, the impacts of the Tax Act, the adoption of new accounting guidance issued for tax benefits on employee share-based compensation transactions, benefits realized from the settlement of uncertain tax positions, and a change in the proportional mix of domestic and international transactions. The 2017 impact of the Tax Act was a $13.7 million tax benefit, primarily from the net impact of the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities utilizing the enacted tax rate at the time they are anticipated to be realized less the estimated tax associated with the deemed mandatory repatriation of undistributed accumulated foreign earnings. This reflects our current estimate of the U.S. income tax effects of the Tax Act, however these are provisional amounts subject to adjustment during the one year measurement period provided pursuant to guidance in SAB 118.\nOur effective income tax rate for 2016 was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% primarily attributable to state income taxes, transaction related taxes, and a change in the proportional mix of domestic and international income, partially offset by federal income tax credits for foreign income taxes and research and development costs.\nOur effective income tax rate for 2015 was favorably impacted by an $11.9 million benefit from the completion of the IRS examination of previously filed federal income tax refund claims for Domestic Manufacturing Deductions, research and experimentation credits and capital losses for 2010 as well as other remeasurements during the period.\nExcluding the effect of discrete period items, we currently expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26.5% in 2018. The 2018 tax rate can be affected as a result of variances among the estimates and amounts of 2018 sources of taxable income (e.g., domestic consolidated, joint venture and/or international), the realization of tax credits, adjustments which may arise from the resolution of tax matters under review, our assessment of our liability for uncertain tax positions, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, federal tax regulations and guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act.\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax decreased $243.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased $199.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the sale of our North American Customer Communications business in July 2016, partially offset by the sale of our U.K. Customer Communications business in May 2017. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to the $234.7 million gain, net of tax, on the sale of our North American Customer Communications business partially offset by $17.0 million of goodwill and asset impairments in our U.K. Customer Communications business.\nYEAR TO YEAR BUSINESS SEGMENT COMPARISONS\nDOMESTIC FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\nThe following

revenues\nDomestic Financial Services segment operating revenues of $1,187.2 million reflect an increase of $191.4 million or 19.2% in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the remaining interest in BFDS, which contributed $176.6 million of incremental operating revenues. Excluding the BFDS operating revenues in 2017, operating revenues for the Domestic Financial Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $14.8 million or 1.5%. This increase in operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 was partially due to a $5.0 million increase in revenue at ALPS resulting from an insurance claim reimbursement of $2.0 million received in fourth quarter 2017 as compared to a reduction to ALPS revenue of $3.0 million during 2016 for the processing error that generated the insurance claim. In addition, operating revenues were higher as a result of increased fund flows and higher market performance at ALPS, partially offset by decreased revenues resulting from the exit of certain product offerings and lower subaccounting and mutual fund registered shareowner account processing revenues. Additionally, software license revenues were $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $3.9 million as compared to 2016.\nCosts and expenses\nDomestic Financial Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1,072.2 million, an increase of $243.2 million as compared to 2016. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $111.8 million in 2017, an increase of $38.8 million as compared to 2016.\nExcluding reimbursable operating expenses, Domestic Financial Services costs and expenses increased $204.4 million or 27.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to $176.3 million of incremental costs and expenses from the consolidation of BFDS following the acquisition of the remaining interest in that entity in 2017 and higher share-based compensation expense which increased $25.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year.\nIn addition, costs and expenses increased from higher integration and restructuring costs related to our BFDS acquisition and higher information technology transformation spend partially offset by the non-recurrence of a software impairment recorded in 2016. We recorded restructuring charges of $16.3 million and $10.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we also recognized $11.6 million of expense related to a charitable contribution of our remaining State Street stock.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDomestic Financial Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $86.8 million, an increase of $9.5 million or 12.3% as compared to 2016. The increase in 2017 was primarily attributable to incremental amortization associated with acquired intangibles from the recent acquisitions as well as increased depreciation from capitalized costs incurred to enhance our network infrastructure, security and regulatory compliance.\nOperating income\nDomestic Financial Services segment operating income for 2017 was $140.0 million, a decrease of $22.5 million or 13.8% as compared to 2016. The decrease in Domestic Financial Services operating income was primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense, higher advisory and restructuring costs due to the integration activities for the recently acquired BFDS business and increased depreciation and amortization expense. Operating income also decreased due to an increase in information technology transformation spend, partially offset by higher revenues.\nComparison of 2016 versus 2015 results\nOperating revenues\nDomestic Financial Services segment operating revenues of $995.8 million increased $12.7 million or 1.3% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven from businesses acquired during 2015 and 2016, which contributed $31.8 million of incremental operating revenues. During 2016, we also completed the conversion of approximately 10.0 million subaccounts associated with a previously announced new client, which resulted in incremental revenues. These increases were partly offset by a decline in mutual fund registered shareowner account processing revenue due to lower registered accounts, primarily as a result of subaccounting conversions, and lower revenue due to extending certain long-term contracts with lower pricing. Additionally, software license revenues were $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.9 million as compared to 2015.\nCosts and expenses\nDomestic Financial Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $829.0 million, an increase of $36.7 million as compared to 2015. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $73.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $12.3 million as compared to 2015.\nExcluding reimbursable operating expenses, Domestic Financial Services costs and expenses increased $24.4 million or 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses during 2016 was primarily from acquisitions completed during 2015 and 2016, which included approximately $33.7 million of incremental expenses. Also, contributing to the increase in costs and expenses were the restructuring activities, which resulted in $10.4 million of employee and lease termination costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 to enhance operational efficiency within the Domestic Financial Services segment. We also incurred increased costs to enhance the network infrastructure utilized across all of our operating businesses and incremental costs to service new and existing clients. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also recognized a $6.0 million software impairment. These costs and expenses were partially offset by the reversal of accrued performance-related share-based compensation expense as 2015 PSUs were not expected to achieve the required performance criteria required for vesting and further savings realized from cost containment initiatives.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDomestic Financial Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $77.3 million, an increase of $9.6 million or 14.2% as compared to 2015. The increase in 2016 was primarily attributable to incremental amortization associated with acquired intangibles from the acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2016 as well as increased depreciation from capitalized costs incurred to enhance our network infrastructure and increase security and regulatory compliance. The increase in 2016 was also attributable to the acceleration of depreciation on certain capitalized software during 2016.\nOperating income\nDomestic Financial Services segment operating income for 2016 was $162.5 million, a decrease of $21.3 million or 11.6% as compared to 2015. The decrease in Domestic Financial Services operating income was primarily due to restructuring costs incurred during 2016, a software impairment charge, and increased costs incurred to enhance our network infrastructure, maintain security and regulatory compliance. These decreases were partially offset by the reversal of accrued performance-related share-based compensation expense, higher operating revenues and cost containment efforts during 2016.\nINTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\nThe following table presents the financial results of the International Financial Services segment (in millions):\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>538.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>427.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>385.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Out-of-pocket reimbursements\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>916.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>550.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>438.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses\n</td> <td>449.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>351.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>357.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>30.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>890.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>553.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the International Financial Services segment's statistical metrics (in millions, except as noted):\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International mutual fund shareowner accounts processed:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IFDS U.K.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IFDS L.P.

The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by the acquisition of the remaining interest in IFDS U.K., which contributed $425.2 million of incremental operating revenues, including the financial impacts resulting from the termination of a wealth management client agreement. The termination agreement resulted in incremental operating revenues of $93.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as DST accelerated recognition of previously deferred revenue and recognized termination payments received. Additionally, software license revenues were $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.6 million as compared to 2016. These increases were partly offset by lower revenues as a result of the previously discussed client termination in mid-2017 as well as the sale of DST Billing Solutions during 2016.\nCosts and expenses\nInternational Financial Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $449.3 million, an increase of $351.1 million as compared to 2016. Costs and expenses in the International Financial Services segment are primarily comprised of compensation and benefit costs as well as technology-related expenditures. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $12.2 million in 2017, an increase of $11.0 million as compared to 2016.\nExcluding reimbursable operating expenses, International Financial Services costs and expenses increased $340.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. Additionally, in connection with the termination agreement described above, we incurred bad debt expense of $34.5 million for previously invoiced services performed prior to the termination and $5.2 million of other termination-related charges.\nDepreciation and amortization\nInternational Financial Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $30.7 million, an increase of $27.6 million as compared to 2016. The increase in 2017 was primarily attributable to incremental amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of fixed assets from the acquisition of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K.\nOperating income\nInternational Financial Services segment operating income for 2017 was $70.6 million, an increase of $59.8 million or 553.7% as compared to 2016. The increase in International Financial Services operating income was primarily due to the impact of the termination of the wealth management client agreement of $53.5 million, including the recognition of previously deferred revenue and termination payments received as described above. The increase in operating income was also due to the higher revenues resulting from the acquisition of the remaining interest in IFDS U.K., partially offset by higher costs and expenses due to on-going development and implementation efforts for wealth management platform clients, share-based compensation expense, and restructuring charges.\nComparison of 2016 versus 2015 results\nOperating revenues\nInternational Financial Services segment operating revenues of $110.9 million increased $17.5 million or 18.7% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the increased professional services revenues associated with our international wealth management platform business. Software license revenues were $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.1 million as compared to 2015.\nCosts and expenses\nInternational Financial Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $98.2 million, an increase of $12.1 million as compared to 2015. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.5 million as compared to 2015.\nExcluding reimbursable operating expenses, International Financial Services costs and expenses increased $12.6 million or 14.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses during 2016 was primarily from higher staffing costs to support the increase in professional services revenues.\nDepreciation and amortization\nInternational Financial Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $3.1 million, a decrease of $1.7 million or 35.4% as compared to 2015. The decrease in 2016 was primarily attributable to lower depreciation from lower capital expenditures.\nOperating income\nInternational Financial Services segment operating income for 2016 was $10.8 million, an increase of $6.6 million or 157.1% as compared to 2015. The increase in International Financial Services operating income was primarily due to the increased professional services revenues associated with our international wealth management platform business.\nHEALTHCARE SERVICES SEGMENT\nThe following table presents the financial results of the Healthcare Services segment (in millions):\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>418.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>426.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>376.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Out-of-pocket reimbursements\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>426.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>434.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>384.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses\n</td> <td>340.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>345.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following tables summarize the Healthcare Services segment's statistical metrics (in millions):\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DST Health Solutions covered lives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Argus pharmacy paid claims\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>507.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>494.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of 2017 versus 2016 results\nOperating revenues\nHealthcare Services segment operating revenues of $418.5 million decreased $7.7 million or 1.8% in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in operating revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the previously announced client transitions off of our systems, which resulted in approximately $46.5 million of lower revenues. Excluding client migrations, Healthcare Services operating revenues increased by $38.8 million or 10.2%. On this basis, the increase in operating revenues primarily resulted from organic growth and the expansion of the high-value services that we are offering to existing clients in both the medical and pharmacy businesses. These increases were partially offset by reductions in membership related to exchanges and lower consulting and development revenues which we believe is the result of a decline in healthcare technology spending due to the ongoing uncertainty around government policy changes. Additionally, operating revenues included approximately $9.8 million of software license fee revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.8 million as compared to 2016.\nCosts and expenses\nHealthcare Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $340.9 million, a decrease of $4.2 million as compared to 2016. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $7.5 million in 2017, a decrease of $1.0 million as compared to 2016. Excluding reimbursable operating expenses, costs and expenses were $333.4 million for 2017, a decrease of $3.2 million as compared to 2016. On this basis, the decrease in costs and expenses during 2017 was primarily due to lower staffing needs resulting from the previously announced client migrations, partially offset by increased restructuring charges and increased share-based compensation expense. We recorded $4.4 million of restructing charges in 2017, as compared to none in 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization\nHealthcare Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $10.5 million, a decrease of $5.1 million or 32.7% as compared to 2016. The decrease is attributable to lower capital expenditures and an intangible asset becoming fully amortized during 2017.\nOperating income\nHealthcare Services segment operating income for 2017 was $74.6 million, an increase of $0.6 million or 0.8% as compared to 2016. The slight increase in operating income was primarily attributable to organic growth and the expansion of the high-value services that we are offering to existing clients in both the medical and pharmacy businesses and decreases in depreciation and amortization. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact of client migrations, restructuring charges, and increased share-based compensation expenses.\nComparison of 2016 versus 2015 results\nOperating revenues\nHealthcare Services segment operating revenues of $426.2 million increased $49.8 million or 13.2% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily from new medical claims processing clients implemented during 2016, organic growth and the expansion of high-value services we are offering to existing clients in both the medical and pharmacy businesses. Operating revenues included approximately $8.0 million of software license fee revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.1 million as compared to 2015.\nCosts and expenses\nHealthcare Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $345.1 million, an increase of $23.8 million as compared to 2015. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $8.5 million in 2016, an increase of $0.3 million as compared to 2015. Excluding reimbursable operating expenses, costs and expenses were $336.6 million for 2016, an increase of $23.5 million as compared to 2015. On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses during 2016 was primarily attributable to increased staffing costs incurred to support the higher medical transaction volumes due to the growth in BPO services. These costs and expenses were partially offset by restructuring costs that occurred during 2015 that did not recur during 2016 and a $2.4 million reduction of share-based compensation expense as certain PSUs were no longer expected to vest.\nDepreciation and amortization\nHealthcare Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $15.6 million, a decrease of $3.0 million or 16.1% as compared to 2015 primarily due to lower capital expenditures.\nOperating income\nHealthcare Services segment operating income for 2016 was $74.0 million, an increase of $29.3 million or 65.5% as compared to 2015. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to higher revenues from organic growth and new medical claims processing clients implemented in 2016, resulting in enhanced economies of scale as clients were converted as well as a reduction of share-based compensation expense as certain PSUs were no longer expected to vest. These increases were partially offset by increased staffing costs incurred to support the higher medical transaction volumes due to the growth in BPO services.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCompany's Assessment of Short-term and Long-term Liquidity\nWe believe that our existing cash balances and other current assets, together with cash provided by operating activities and, as necessary, our revolving credit facilities, are sufficient to meet our operating and debt service requirements and other current liabilities for at least the next 12 months. Further, we believe that our longer term liquidity and capital requirements will also be met through cash provided by operating activities, bank credit facilities and other investments.\nAt December 31, 2017, total cash and cash equivalents were $80.5 million, of which $46.0 million was held outside of the U.S. Although the amounts held outside the U.S. have been taxed through the Transition Tax, these amounts could be subject to other taxes such as withholding taxes and local taxes. We have accrued for withholding taxes and local taxes on the earnings of our international subsidiaries except when the earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. The repatriation of these earnings could result in additional withholding and local tax payments in future years. We utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had approximately $990.7 million of availability under our domestic revolving credit facilities, including our accounts receivable securitization program. Debt obligations, classified as long-term when originally issued, existing as of December 31, 2017 that are scheduled to mature in 2018 include $65.0 million of Series C 2010 Senior Notes that are scheduled to mature in August 2018 and $3.7 million of payments related to outstanding mortgages. We are scheduled\nto issue $65.0 million of Series C 2017 Senior Notes in August 2018 which are expected to be utilized to repay the Series C 2010 Senior Notes.\nWe may need to access debt and equity markets in the future if unforeseen costs or opportunities arise, to fund acquisitions or investments or to repay indebtedness. If we need to obtain new debt or equity financing in the future, the terms and availability of such financing may be impacted by economic and financial market conditions as well as our financial condition and results of operations at the time we seek additional financing. We currently have $585.0 million of additional capacity pursuant to the master note purchase agreement dated November 14, 2017 that could be utilized for future debt issuances.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe had $80.5 million, $195.5 million and $79.5 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our primary source of liquidity has historically been cash provided by operations. In addition, we have used proceeds from the sale of investments to fund other investing and financing activities. Principal uses of cash are operations, reinvestment in our proprietary technologies, capital expenditures, investment purchases, business acquisitions, payments on debt, stock repurchases and dividend payments. Additionally, we expect to incur significant transaction costs associated with the completion of the Merger. Information on our consolidated cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, categorized by operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.\nThe sale of our North American Customer Communications business on July 1, 2016 and our U.K. Customer Communications business on May 4, 2017 resulted in cash consideration of approximately $410.7 million and $43.6 million, respectively, net of tax. The after-tax proceeds from the sales were used in accordance with the Company's capital plan, including investments in the business, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, debt repayments and other corporate purposes.\nOperating Activities\nCash flows provided from continuing operating activities were $164.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating cash flows from continuing operating activities during 2017 resulted principally from income from continuing operations of $447.6 million, adjusted for non-cash or non-operating items of $108.2 million including depreciation and amortization, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net gains on investments and gains recognized on the step up of the carrying value of our previously held equity interests in unconsolidated affiliates as a result of the acquisitions of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K., and a use of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $175.4 million. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities include a $127.9 million use of cash related to other assets primarily due to up-front payments made to clients which are expected to be recovered over the clients' contractual arrangements and higher prepaid software costs, a $39.9 million use of cash for accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and a $29.6 million use of cash related to deferred revenue and gains primarily as a result of the wealth management platform client termination.\nCash flows provided from continuing operating activities were $162.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating cash flows from continuing operations during 2016 resulted principally from income from continuing operations of $178.1 million, adjusted for non-cash or non-operating items of $90.4 million including depreciation and amortization and equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, and a use of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $105.8 million. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities include a $26.9 million use of cash related to accrued compensation and benefits, a $16.6 million source of cash resulting from accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a $16.0 million use of cash related to accounts receivable, and a $67.9 million use of cash related to timing of income tax payments.\nCash flows provided from continuing operating activities were $135.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating cash flows from continuing operating activities during 2015 resulted principally from income from continuing operations of $309.6 million, adjusted for non-cash or non-operating items of $110.3 million including depreciation and amortization, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and net gains on investments, and a use of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $63.6 million. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities include a $10.6 million use of cash related to accounts receivable, and a $31.6 million use of cash related to timing of income tax payments.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in continuing investing activities were $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Sources of our cash inflows were net investment activities (proceeds from investment sales, net of investments in securities) of $39.8 million, fluctuations in funds held on behalf of clients of $43.3 million and distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates of $32.7 million, primarily from IFDS L.P in connection with the acquisition of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K., offset by cash used to acquire IFDS U.K. (net of cash acquired) of $38.9 million and capital expenditures of $78.8 million.\nCash flows used in continuing investing activities during 2016 of $117.3 million were primarily attributable to net investment activities (proceeds from investment sales, net of investments in securities) of $59.5 million, offset by cash used to acquire KRFS of $93.5 million, capital expenditures of $60.4 million, fluctuations in funds held on behalf of clients of $20.3 million, as well as approximately $28.0 million of cash loaned to IFDS U.K. during 2016.\nCash flows used in continuing investing activities were $102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily attributable to net investment activities (proceeds from investment sales, net of investments in securities) of $192.2 million, which includes $176.1 million of pretax proceeds from the sale of State Street stock. These sources of cash were offset by $117.4 million of cash used to acquire kasina LLC, Red Rocks Capital LLC and Wealth Management Systems, Inc. during 2015, $88.9 million used to purchase capital assets, as well as $113.5 million due to fluctuations in funds held on behalf of clients.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following table summarizes capital expenditures by segment (in millions):\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic Financial Services segment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International Financial Services segment\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare Services segment\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2017, 2016 and 2015, we capitalized software development costs of $24.1 million, $21.5 million and $23.3 million, respectively, which are included within the capital expenditures listed above. Capital expenditures using debt are treated as non-cash transactions and are not included in the annual capital expenditure amounts above.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows used in continuing financing activities totaled $317.4 million, $374.8 million and $278.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCommon Stock Issuances and Repurchases\nWe received cash proceeds of $2.8 million, $5.3 million and $11.8 million from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of employee stock options during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The value of shares received in exchange for satisfaction of the exercise price and for tax-withholding obligations arising from the exercise of options to purchase our stock or from the vesting of restricted shares are included in Common stock repurchased in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $150.0 million of capacity remaining under our share repurchase plan authorized in 2016. On May 9, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new $300.0 million share repurchase plan, which allows, but does not require, the repurchase of common stock in open market and private transactions. We repurchased the equivalent of 5.0 million shares of our common stock on a post stock split basis for $300.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, which left approximately $150.0 million remaining under our share repurchase plan authorized in 2017. The 2017 share repurchase plan does not have an expiration date, however we are currently precluded from executing additional stock repurchases pursuant to the Merger Agreement with SS&C. Under previous share repurchase plans, we expended $300.0 million for approximately 5.4 million shares on a post stock split basis and $400.0 million for approximately 7.2 million shares on a post stock split basis during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDividends\nWe paid cash dividends of $0.72, $0.66 and $0.60 per common share in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The total cash paid for dividends in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $43.7 million, $43.4 million and $43.1 million, respectively. We are currently precluded from declaring dividends pursuant to the Merger Agreement with SS&C.\nClient Funds Obligations\nClient funds obligations represent our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client pharmacy claim obligations and are recorded on the balance sheet when incurred, generally after a claim has been processed by us. In addition, client funds obligations include transfer agency client balances invested overnight. Our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client obligations are primarily sourced by funds held on behalf of clients. We had $504.2 million, $564.6 million and $533.4 million of client funds obligations at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDebt Activity\nDuring 2017, we had the following primary sources of debt financing: our syndicated revolving credit facility; accounts receivable securitization program; and privately placed senior notes (the 2010 Senior Notes\u201d and 2017 Senior Notes\u201d). We had $620.8 million, $508.2 million and $562.1 million of debt outstanding at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $112.6 million during 2017 and a decrease of $53.9 million during 2016.\nThe increase in debt outstanding during 2017 resulted primarily from issuing $350.0 million of 2017 Senior Notes in November 2017, the assumption of a mortgage as a result of the acquisition of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. and the assumption of a mortgage associated with a real estate distribution from Broadway Square Partners, partially offset by a reduction in amounts outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization program and revolving credit facilities. Proceeds from the 2017 Senior Notes were primarily used to pay down our revolving credit facilities. The decrease in debt outstanding during 2016 resulted primarily from the utilization of the proceeds from the sale of our North American Customer Communications business to pay down outstanding balances, partially offset by borrowings to fund the KRFS business acquisition, share repurchases and working capital uses.\nOur debt agreements contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on consolidated indebtedness, liens, investments, subsidiary indebtedness, asset dispositions and require certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios to be maintained. We are currently in compliance with these covenants. A default under certain of our borrowings could trigger defaults under certain of our other debt obligations, which in turn could result in their maturities being accelerated. Our debt arrangements are further described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10, Debt.\u201d\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017 (in millions):\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>623.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>104.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software license agreements\n</td> <td>135.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>39.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>901.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>302.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>368.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest obligations on our outstanding debt are not included in the table above. The syndicated revolving credit facility contains grid schedules that adjust borrowing costs up or down based upon our consolidated leverage ratio. The grid schedules may result in fluctuations in borrowing costs ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% over Eurodollar and 0.00% to 0.70% over base rate, as defined. The 2010 Senior Notes outstanding have fixed interest rates and are comprised of $65.0 million of 5.06% Series C Senior Notes and $160.0 million of 5.42% Series D Senior Notes. The $350.0 million of 2017 Senior Notes outstanding have an average fixed interest rate of approximately 4.0%. In addition to the financial instruments listed above, the program fees incurred on proceeds from the sale of receivables under our accounts receivable securitization program are determined based on variable interest rates associated with LIBOR plus an applicable margin.\nWe have liabilities for income tax uncertainties of $67.7 million at December 31, 2017. These obligations are classified as non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as resolution of these matters is expected to take more than a year; however, the ultimate timing of resolution is uncertain. As we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits, our liability for income tax uncertainties is not included in the table above.\nDue to the enactment of the Tax Act, we recorded a provisional income tax payable related to the Transition Tax of $8.4 million, of which $7.3 million is reported as noncurrent as it is not expected to be paid within one year. As permitted by the Tax Act, the Transition Tax will be paid over an eight-year period, beginning in 2018, and will not accrue interest. This\nprovisional amount, as well as the current estimated timing of payments, is subject to change based on additional guidance from and interpretations by U.S. regulatory and standard-setting bodies and changes in assumptions.\nOther Commercial Commitments\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products and other business assets, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. At December 31, 2017, except for certain immaterial items, there were no liabilities for guarantees or indemnifications as it is not possible to determine either the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements or the timing of any such payments due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSS&C Merger Agreement\nUnder certain circumstances, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $165.0 million to SS&C in the event the Merger Agreement with SS&C is terminated.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAn off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company.\nWe believe that our guarantee arrangements will not have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, capital expenditures, capital resources, liquidity or results of operations. These arrangements are described above and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains forward-looking statements\u201d - that is, statements related to future, not past, events. In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d believe,\u201d seek,\u201d see,\u201d will,\u201d would,\u201d or target.\u201d Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain.\nFor us, particular risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements include:\n \u2022 the effects of competition in the businesses in which we operate; \n \u2022 changes in client demand and our ability to provide products and services on terms that are favorable to us; \n \u2022 changes in law, economic and financial conditions; \n \u2022 the impacts of breaches or potential breaches of network, information technology or data security, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war or significant litigation and any resulting financial impact not covered by insurance; \n \u2022 the effectiveness of our risk management framework; \n \u2022 the impact of regulation and regulatory, investigative and legal proceedings and legal compliance risks, including the impact of financial services regulation and litigation and potential SEC or DOL regulations impacting third-party distributors of mutual funds; \n \u2022 our investments in funds and other companies may decline; \n \u2022 our ability to successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses; \n \u2022 the risk that the proposed Merger with SS&C will not be consummated within the expected time period or at all, including the risk that the Company may be unable to obtain stockholder approval as required for the Merger and conditions to the closing of the Merger may not be satisfied or waived on a timely basis or otherwise; \n \u2022 the risk that a governmental entity or a regulatory body may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the Merger and may require conditions, limitations or restrictions in connection with such approvals that can adversely affect the anticipated benefits of the proposed Merger or cause the parties to abandon the proposed Merger; \n \u2022 the risk that the business of the Company may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the Merger or the potential adverse changes to business relationships resulting from the proposed Merger; \n \u2022 the risk that the Merger may involve unexpected costs, liabilities or delays; \n \u2022 the risk that legal proceedings may be initiated related to the Merger and the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the Merger may be adverse to the Company; and \n \u2022 the other factors that are described in Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K. \nThese or other uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements. This document includes certain forward-looking projected financial information that is based on current estimates and forecasts. Actual results could differ materially.\nFuture economic and industry trends that could potentially impact our financial statements or results of operations are difficult to predict. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of the date of this report. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized, except as may be required by law.\nIntroduction\nDST Systems, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries use proprietary software applications to provide sophisticated information processing and servicing solutions through strategically unified data management and business process solutions to clients globally within the asset management, brokerage, retirement, healthcare and other markets. Our wholly-owned data centers provide the secure technology infrastructure necessary to support our solutions. In order to position the Company to take advantage of new and emerging technologies, we are embarking on an information technology transformation effort which will increase our operating expenses for the near term. We expect these investments will result in lower centralized infrastructure costs and a more agile platform on which to deliver future capabilities.\nOn January 11, 2018, we entered into a Merger Agreement wherein SS&C will acquire DST. Under the terms of the agreement, SS&C will purchase DST in an all-cash transaction for $84.00 per share plus the assumption of debt, equating to an enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion. We have agreed to customary covenants in the Merger Agreement, including with respect to the operation of our business prior to the closing of the transaction or termination of the agreement, such as\nrestrictions on making certain acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and expenditures, paying dividends, repurchasing stock and taking other specified actions. The transaction is subject to DST stockholder approval, clearances by the relevant regulatory authorities and other customary closing conditions and is currently expected to close by the end of the second quarter 2018; however, there can be no assurances as to the actual closing or the timing of the closing. Consummation of the proposed Merger would constitute a change of control of DST under the partnership agreement of IFDS L.P. and, as a result, the other partner would have the option to purchase our interests in IFDS L.P. at a price equal to book value, unless another purchase provision in the partnership agreement was triggered prior to the change of control.\nIn March 2017, we acquired State Street's ownership interests in our joint ventures BFDS and IFDS U.K., as well as other investments and real estate held by IFDS L.P. The BFDS acquisition was effectuated through a non-taxable exchange of our State Street common stock with a fair value of $163.4 million for State Street's ownership interest in BFDS. We also acquired State Street's ownership interest in IFDS U.K., and IFDS L.P.'s ownership in IFDS Percana and IFDS Realty U.K. for total cash consideration of $234.9 million.\nIn May 2017, we completed the sale of our U.K. Customer Communications business for cash consideration of $43.6 million. We recorded a pretax gain of $2.6 million on the sale during 2017. We sold our North American Customer Communications business for cash consideration of $410.7 million on July 1, 2016 and we recorded a pretax gain of $341.5 million on the sale in 2016. We have classified the results of the businesses sold as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. The net after-tax proceeds from these sales are being used in accordance with the Company's capital plan, including investments in the business, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, debt repayments and other corporate purposes, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Merger Agreement with SS&C.\nBeginning in 2017, DST established a new reportable segment structure that reflects how management is now operating the business and making resource allocations following the acquisitions of IFDS U.K. and BFDS, as well as the recent reductions in non-core investment assets. The Company's operating business units are now reported as three operating segments (Domestic Financial Services, International Financial Services and Healthcare Services). Prior periods have been revised to reflect the new reportable operating segments.\nDomestic Financial Services Segment\nThrough the Domestic Financial Services segment, we provide investor, investment, advisor/intermediary and asset distribution services to companies within the U.S. financial services industry. Utilizing our proprietary software applications, we offer our clients information processing solutions that enable them to capture, analyze and report their investors' transactions including direct and intermediary sales of mutual funds, alternative investments, securities brokerage accounts and retirement plans. Examples of the services we provide include tracking of purchases, redemptions, exchanges and transfers of shares; maintaining investor identification and ownership records; reconciling cash and share activity; processing dividends; reporting sales; and performing tax and other compliance functions. We also support full reporting to investors for confirmations, statements and tax forms, web access, and electronic delivery of documents.\nServices are provided either on a Remote or BPO basis utilizing our proprietary software applications. Our BPO service offerings are enhanced by our proprietary workflow software, which is also licensed separately to third parties.\nDomestic Financial Services fees are primarily charged to the client based on the number of accounts, participants or transactions processed. For subaccounts, a portion of the services we provide for registered accounts are provided directly by the broker/dealer. As a result, our revenue per account is generally higher for registered accounts than for subaccounts. On a more limited basis, we also generate revenue through asset-based fee arrangements and from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in our full service transfer agency bank accounts. We typically have multi-year agreements with our clients. We are continuing to monitor changes in the financial services industry, including the shift from direct products to fee-based platforms which could reduce the number of direct mutual fund registered accounts we service.\nIn December 2017, we entered into a ten year contract with a new client to provide both mutual fund and retirement servicing solutions. Based on current volumes, the client is expected to convert approximately 2.0 million registered accounts and 0.3 million retirement accounts onto our platforms during mid to late 2019. This new client currently performs their processing in-house and in order to assist the new client with covering the costs to transition to our platforms we have agreed to pay them $13.0 million in transition assistance during the conversion, of which $2.0 million was paid in December 2017. The total amounts will be amortized as a reduction to revenue over the course of the ten year contractual term.\nAdditionally in December 2017, we renewed our largest Domestic Financial Services client to a new seven year contract. Based upon our new rate structure, we expect our operating revenue in 2018 associated with this client to be relatively consistent with the 2017 revenue.\nAs part of the continuing strategic review of our operations, we decided not to renew a long-term surety bond insurance agreement which expired in December 2017 as the proposed revised terms were no longer economically advantageous. This agreement historically generated approximately $14.0 million of annual revenue.\nOn February 24, 2016, we acquired all of the membership interests of Kaufman Rossin Fund Services LLC ( KRFS\u201d), an independent, full-service provider of specialized hedge fund administration services to the global financial community. KRFS' hedge fund services include accounting and valuation, back-office outsourcing, investor services, treasury services, and customized reporting.\nDuring 2015, we acquired all of the membership interests of kasina LLC, a strategic advisory firm to the asset management industry, and Red Rocks Capital LLC, an asset manager which focuses on listed private equity and other private asset investments. In 2015, we also acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Wealth Management Systems Inc., a provider of technology-based rollover services in the retirement marketplace.\nIn December 2015, we entered into a ten year contract with a new client to provide both subaccounting and mutual fund servicing solutions. The client converted approximately 10.0 million subaccounts onto our platform during 2016 and converted approximately 2.6 million registered accounts onto our platform during the third quarter of 2017.\nInternational Financial Services Segment\nWe offer investor and policyholder administration and technology services on a Remote and BPO basis in the U.K. and, through our joint venture IFDS L.P., in Canada, Ireland, and Luxembourg. Additionally, in Australia and in the U.K., we provide solutions related to participant accounting and recordkeeping for wealth management, wrap platforms\u201d and retirement savings ( superannuation\u201d) industries/markets through use of our wealth management platform and our life and pension administration system.\nOur primary clients are mutual fund managers, insurers and platform providers. International Financial Services fees are primarily charged to the client based on the number of accounts or transactions processed. We also realize revenues from fixed-fee license agreements that include provisions for ongoing support and maintenance and for additional license payments in the event that usage increases. Additionally, we derive professional service revenues from fees for implementation services, custom programming and data center operations. We typically have multi-year agreements with our clients.\nIn November 2016, we sold a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary that provides water billing software and services solutions for cash consideration of approximately $6.1 million. This business had approximately $5.4 million of operating revenue and $1.2 million of operating income on an annual basis. As these decisions were the result of a tactical review of our products and services, and not the result of a significant shift in strategic direction, the revenue and operating income from these products and services are included within our continuing operations.\nDuring 2017, we reached a termination agreement with a wealth management platform client who had engaged us for a multi-year development and implementation effort as well as post-implementation services. The termination agreement resulted in incremental operating revenues of $93.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as we accelerated recognition of previously deferred revenue and recognized termination payments received. Additionally, our International Financial Services segment has been notified that two of our clients, which have collectively contributed approximately $33.0 million of annual revenue, will be migrating off our FAST platform in stages through the end of 2018.\nHealthcare Services Segment\nThe Healthcare Services segment uses our proprietary software applications to provide healthcare organizations a variety of medical and pharmacy benefit solutions to satisfy their information processing, quality of care, cost management concerns and payment integrity programs, while achieving compliance and improving operational efficiencies. Our healthcare solutions include claims adjudication, benefit management, care management, business intelligence and other ancillary services. We also continue to expand and enhance our Healthcare Services' offerings to ensure we are able to address the changing needs of our clients within the complex and highly regulated health industries which we serve. For example, our pharmacy management business continues to make investments to expand our clinical, network, and analytic capabilities to help our clients and prospective clients achieve the best possible outcomes for their members and to allow us to more effectively compete in the broader competitive pharmacy benefit manager ( PBM\u201d) market. Historically, we have acted as an agent within our pharmacy-solutions business and, accordingly, recognized revenue on a net basis. As our enhanced products evolve and we expand our pharmacy-solutions service offerings, we will evaluate the provisions within our new pharmacy network and client contracts to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent in the transactions. If we determine that we are acting as a principal in the transactions, we will report the transactions on a gross basis, resulting in significantly higher revenues and costs reflected within our consolidated financial statements.\nWe generally derive revenue from our pharmacy-solutions business on a transactional fee basis. Fees are earned on pharmacy claims processing and payments services, pharmacy and member call center services, pharmaceutical rebate administration, administration or management of clinical programs, pharmacy network management, member and plan web services and management information and reporting. Further, revenues include investment earnings related to client cash balances maintained in our bank accounts. Medical claim processing revenues are generally derived from fees charged on a per member/per month basis or transactional basis. We also realize revenue from fixed-fee license agreements that include provisions for ongoing support and maintenance and for additional license payments in the event that usage or members increase. Additionally, we derive professional service revenues from fees for implementation services, custom programming and data center operations.\nDuring 2017, we renewed our pharmacy services contract with our Healthcare Services segment's third largest client extending the term of the contract through December 31, 2020. As previously announced, two of our Healthcare Services clients transitioned their services off our systems during 2017. Additionally, we have been notified that one of our largest Healthcare Services clients, which contributed approximately $50.0 million of annual revenue, will be migrating off our medical claims processing platform in stages through the end of 2019.\nSeasonality\nGenerally, we do not have significant seasonal fluctuations in our business operations. Processing volumes for mutual fund clients within our Domestic and International Financial Services segment are usually highest during the quarter ended March 31 due primarily to processing year-end transactions during January. We have historically added operating equipment in the last half of the year in preparation for processing year-end transactions, which has the effect of increasing costs for the second half of the year. Revenues and operating results from individual license sales vary depending on the timing and size of the contracts.\nNew Authoritative Accounting Guidance\nSee Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies - New authoritative accounting guidance.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: revenue recognition; software capitalization and amortization; depreciation of fixed assets; valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill; accounting for investments; and accounting for income taxes.\nRevenue recognition\nWe recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and it is earned. The majority of our revenues are derived from computer processing and services and are recognized upon completion of the services provided. Software license fees, maintenance fees and other ancillary fees are recognized as services are provided or delivered and all client obligations have been met. We generally do not have payment terms from clients that extend beyond one year. Billing for services in advance of performance is recorded as deferred revenue.\nWe recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured. If there is a client-specific acceptance provision in a contract or if there is uncertainty about client acceptance, the associated revenue is deferred until we have evidence of client acceptance.\nRevenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables (items) can be divided into more than one unit of accounting. An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: 1) the delivered item(s) has value to the client on a standalone basis and 2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. Once separate units of accounting are determined, the arrangement consideration\nshould be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence, which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from third-party evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items. If such evidence is unavailable, we use our best estimate of the selling price, which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.\nWe derive over 90% of our revenues as a result of providing processing and services under contracts. The majority of our fees are billed on a monthly basis, generally with thirty-day collection terms. Revenues are recognized for monthly processing and services upon performance of the services.\nOur standard business practice is to bill monthly for development, consulting and training services on a time and materials basis. In some cases we bill a fixed fee for development and consulting services. For fixed fee arrangements, we recognize revenue on a proportionate performance\u201d basis. We periodically provide upfront cash payments to our clients to assist with the significant upfront costs associated with converting to new systems. Such payments are treated as a reduction of revenue over the term of the related contract.\nWe derive less than 10% of our revenues from licensing products. We license our wealth management products, life and pension administration system, AWD products and healthcare administration processing software solutions. Perpetual software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed, the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist. Deferral of software license revenue billed results from delayed payment provisions, disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services. Term software license revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the license agreement. While license fee revenues are not a significant percentage of our total operations, they can significantly impact earnings in the period in which they are recognized. Revenues from individual license sales depend heavily on the timing, size and nature of the contract. We recognize revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term, after collectability has been reasonably assured.\nWe may enter into arrangements with broker/dealers or other third parties to sell or market closed-end fund shares. Depending on the arrangement, we may earn distribution fees for marketing and selling the underlying fund shares. Conversely, we may incur distribution expenses, including structuring fees, finders' fees and referral fees paid to unaffiliated broker/dealers or introducing parties for marketing and selling underlying fund shares of a closed-end fund we sponsor. While distribution revenues and expenses are not significant percentages of our operating revenues or costs and expenses, they can significantly impact operations and earnings in the period in which they are recognized.\nWe have entered into various agreements with related parties, principally unconsolidated affiliates, under which we have historically provided data processing and software services. We believe that the terms of our contracts with related parties are fair to us and are no less favorable than those obtained from unaffiliated parties.\nWe assess collection based on a variety of factors, including past collection history with the client and the credit-worthiness of the client. We generally do not request collateral from our client. If we determine that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred and is recognized at the time it becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. Allowances for billing adjustments and bad debt expense are estimated as revenues are recognized. Allowances for billing adjustments are recorded as reductions in revenues and bad debt expense is recorded within Costs and expenses. The annual amounts for these items are generally immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.\nSoftware capitalization and amortization\nWe make substantial investments in software to enhance the functionality and facilitate the delivery of our processing services as well as our sale of licensed products. Purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years. We develop a large portion of our software internally. We capitalize software development costs for computer software developed or obtained for internal use after the preliminary project phase has been completed and management has committed to funding the project. For computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed to third parties, we capitalize software development costs which are incurred after the products reach technological feasibility but prior to the general release of the product to clients. The capitalized software development costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining what projects and costs associated with software development will be capitalized and in assigning estimated economic lives to the completed projects. Management specifically evaluates software development projects and analyzes the percentage of completion as compared to the initial plan and subsequent forecasts, milestones achieved and the commitment to continue funding the projects. Significant changes in any of these items may result in discontinuing capitalization of development costs, as well as immediately expensing previously capitalized costs. We review, on a quarterly basis, our capitalized software for possible impairment.\nDepreciation of fixed assets\nFor personal property, we generally prefer to own rather than lease the property when practicable. We believe this approach provides us with better flexibility for disposing or redeploying the asset as it nears the completion of its economic life. We depreciate technology equipment using accelerated depreciation methods over the following lives: (1) non-mainframe equipment-three years; (2) mainframe central processing unit-four years; and (3) mainframe direct access storage devices-five years. We depreciate furniture and fixtures over estimated useful lives, principally three to five years, using accelerated depreciation methods. We depreciate leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or life of the improvements. Management judgment is required in assigning economic lives to fixed assets. Management specifically analyzes fixed asset additions, remaining net book values and gain/loss upon disposition of fixed assets to determine the appropriateness of assigned economic lives. Significant changes in any of these items may result in changes in the economic life assigned and the resulting depreciation expense.\nValuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment. We evaluate the impairment of goodwill at least annually (as of October 1) and evaluate identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following: significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our strategy for the overall business; and significant negative industry or economic trends. When it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we assess actual impairment based on cash flows.\nOur assessment of goodwill for impairment may first include a qualitative assessment that considers various factors, including those described above as well as growth in operating revenues and income from operations of our reporting units since our last quantitative assessment. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if a qualitative assessment is not performed.\nOur quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment includes comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value, including goodwill. We estimate fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market approaches. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. After a goodwill impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill becomes its new accounting basis.\nOur 2017, 2016 and 2015 annual goodwill impairment tests determined that goodwill was not impaired, except during 2016 for the goodwill held at the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit, which is included as a component of discontinued operations, as further described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data - Note 4, Discontinued Operations.\u201d\nAccounting for investments\nWe have four significant types of investments: 1) investments in available-for-sale securities; 2) investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are comprised principally of IFDS L.P. and certain real estate joint ventures; 3) investments in private equity funds and other investments accounted for under the cost method; and 4) seed capital investments accounted for at fair value.\nWe account for investments in entities in which we own less than 20% and do not have significant influence in accordance with authoritative guidance related to accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, which requires us to designate our investments as trading or available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to Accumulated other comprehensive income within Stockholders' equity.\nWe regularly review investment securities for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds fair value, the duration of any market decline, and the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer. We record an investment impairment charge for an investment with a gross unrealized holding loss resulting from a decline in value that is other than temporary. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment's current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on our financial position.\nThe equity method of accounting is used for investments in entities, partnerships and similar interests (including investments in private equity funds where we are the limited partner) in which we have significant influence but do not control. We classify\nthese investments as unconsolidated affiliates. Under the equity method, we recognize income or losses from our pro-rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates' net income or loss, which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate. In certain cases, pro-rata losses are recognized only to the extent of our investment and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate.\nThe cost method of accounting is used for these investments when we have a de minimis ownership percentage and do not have significant influence. Our cost method investments are held at the lower of cost or market.\nAccounting for income taxes\nWe account for income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof).\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), resulting in significant modifications to existing U.S. tax law, including but not limited to, (1) lowering the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018; (2) eliminating the domestic production activity deduction; (3) implementing a territorial tax system; and (4) imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) which provides additional clarification in situations where we do not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act for the reporting period in which the Tax Act was enacted. We have recognized the provisional tax impacts, based on reasonable estimates, related to the one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through the year ended December 31, 2017 ( Transition Tax\u201d) and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and has included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act. We intend to complete our accounting under the Tax Act within the measurement period set forth in SAB 118.\nIn addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for potential tax exposures based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be required. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, then we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained if challenged by the taxing authorities. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given period may be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require cash payments and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. We report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions within income tax expense.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results (in millions).

the year ended December 31, 2016 and increased $82.7 million or 5.6% during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Consolidated operating revenues increased $612.3 million or 41.5% in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K. in 2017 which collectively contributed $601.8 million of incremental operating revenue during 2017. Consolidated operating revenues increased $69.4 million or 4.9% in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily as a result of the acquisitions of KRFS in February 2016, Red Rocks Capital LLC in July 2015 and Wealth Management Systems Inc. in August 2015.\nPrior to the acquisitions of BFDS and IFDS U.K., we received revenues for processing services and products provided under agreements with these entities. Our operating revenues derived from sales to these entities were $138.5 million and $134.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and $35.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The operating results of BFDS and IFDS U.K. were consolidated within our operating results subsequent to the acquisition dates.\nConsolidated OOP reimbursements increased $49.2 million or 59.8% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased $13.3 million or 19.3% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in consolidated OOP reimbursements in 2017 is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K. The increase in consolidated OOP reimbursements in 2016 is primarily attributable to increased client volumes in the Domestic Financial Services segment.\nCosts and expenses\nConsolidated costs and expenses (including OOP reimbursements) increased $591.6 million or 48.8% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased $63.2 million or 5.5% in 2016 as compared to 2015. Costs and expenses are primarily comprised of compensation and benefit costs, reimbursable operating expenses, information technology spend and professional fees. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $131.5 million, $82.3 million and $69.0 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding reimbursable operating expenses, costs and expenses increased $542.4 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased $49.9 million in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nThe increase in costs and expenses in 2017, exclusive of reimbursable expenses, is primarily attributable to the consolidation of BFDS and IFDS U.K. following the acquisitions of the remaining interests in these entities during 2017. Share-based compensation expense increased $31.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily driven by the prior year reversal of accrued performance-related share-based compensation expense as 2015 PSUs were not expected to achieve the required performance criteria combined with increased share-based compensation expense in 2017 related to 2016 and 2017 PSUs that are currently expected to vest at a higher conversion rate than target. In addition, we recorded increased bad debt expense and a significant charitable contribution transaction in 2017.\nAs a result of changes in our business environment, including the transition of certain Health Services clients off of our systems, the termination of a wealth management client in the International Financial Services segment, and the acquisitions of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K., we have implemented restructuring initiatives to right-size our organization and enhance operational efficiencies, as well as achieve synergies from our recent acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred pretax restructuring charges primarily related to employee terminations and related costs of $23.4 million in Costs and expenses. Annualized savings achieved from the actions taken from March 2017 through October 2017 are currently expected to be approximately $22.0 million within the Domestic Financial Services segment, approximately $7.0 million within the International Financial Services segment and approximately $13.0 million within the Healthcare Services segment.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $10.4 million and $3.4 million of pretax restructuring charges, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization\nConsolidated depreciation and amortization increased $32.0 million or 33.3% during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of the acquisitions of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K. and increased $4.9 million or 5.4% during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the acquisition of KRFS.\nOperating income\nConsolidated operating income increased $37.9 million or 15.3% to $285.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased $14.6 million or 6.3% to $247.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense was $26.8 million, $23.5 million and $23.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense increased 14.0% during 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to higher borrowings as a result of the acquisition of IFDS U.K. and higher borrowing rates on the $350.0 million of debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2017. Interest expense decreased 1.3% during 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily from lower weighted average debt balances outstanding.\nGain on sale of business\nOn November 1, 2016, we sold DST Billing Solutions Limited ( Billing Solutions\u201d) for cash consideration of approximately $6.1 million. Operating revenue and income generated for the Billing Solutions business sold was approximately $4.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016. We recorded a pretax gain of $5.5 million on the sale of the business during 2016.\nOther income, net\nThe components of other income, net are as follows (in millions):\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized gains from the disposition of available-for-sale securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on previously held equity interests\n</td> <td>43.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain on private equity funds and other investments\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend income\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Miscellaneous items\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>204.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncluded in the net realized gains from the disposition of available-for-sale securities during 2015 were gains of $157.3 million from the sale of approximately 2.3 million shares of State Street common stock as compared to no sales of State Street shares during 2016. We recognized a realized gain of $145.1 million from the exchange of State Street common stock for the remaining interests in BFDS in 2017. We also recognized a realized gain of $10.4 million from the charitable contribution of our remaining State Street shares in 2017. Additionally, as a result of the 2017 acquisitions, we recorded a net pretax gain of $43.8 million on the step-up of our previous 50% ownership interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K. during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe recorded a net gain on private equity funds and other investments of $15.4 million, $16.5 million and $35.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to distributions received from certain of our private equity fund investments resulting in realized gains. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments and may require an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on our net income.\nWe receive dividend income from certain investments held. The decline in dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by our reduction of our investment in State Street common stock in March 2017. Dividends received from State Street common stock were $0.1 million, $3.1 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is as follows (in millions):\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International Financial Data Services U.K.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International Financial Data Services L.P.\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Boston Financial Data Services, Inc.\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other unconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>31.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEquity in earnings of IFDS U.K. decreased $9.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily as a result of the discontinuation of equity method accounting subsequent to our acquisition of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. Equity in earnings of IFDS U.K. decreased $12.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily attributable to lower revenues recognized related to client conversion activities and higher operating costs as IFDS U.K. expanded its infrastructure to address increasing regulatory, compliance and security needs.\nEquity in earnings of IFDS L.P. increased $16.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily as a result of $10.2 million of realized gains on the step-up of certain investments and real estate assets that were distributed from the joint venture to DST and State Street immediately prior to the acquisitions by DST of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. and BFDS. Equity in earnings of IFDS L.P. decreased $5.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015.\nEquity in earnings of BFDS decreased $4.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily as a result of the discontinuation of equity method accounting subsequent to the acquisition of the remaining interests in BFDS in March 2017. Equity in earnings of BFDS increased $3.0 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to higher ancillary and non-operating revenues as well as a reduction in operating costs.\nOur equity in earnings of other unconsolidated affiliates was $31.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $24.9 million as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $23.0 million increase resulting from a gain on the step-up of real estate distributed from Broadway Square Partners, LLP ( Broadway Square Partners\u201d), an unconsolidated affiliate, during 2017. Our equity in earnings of other unconsolidated affiliates was $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $3.5 million as compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $3.6 million gain resulting from the sale of real estate by an unconsolidated affiliate during 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately $40.8 million of our consolidated retained earnings represents undistributed earnings in our unconsolidated affiliates accounted for by the equity method of accounting.\nIncome taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 15.8%, 36.2% and 32.5% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our income tax rate for 2017 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the non-taxable nature of the BFDS exchange transaction, the impacts of the Tax Act, the adoption of new accounting guidance issued for tax benefits on employee share-based compensation transactions, benefits realized from the settlement of uncertain tax positions, and a change in the proportional mix of domestic and international transactions. The 2017 impact of the Tax Act was a $13.7 million tax benefit, primarily from the net impact of the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities utilizing the enacted tax rate at the time they are anticipated to be realized less the estimated tax associated with the deemed mandatory repatriation of undistributed accumulated foreign earnings. This reflects our current estimate of the U.S. income tax effects of the Tax Act, however these are provisional amounts subject to adjustment during the one year measurement period provided pursuant to guidance in SAB 118.\nOur effective income tax rate for 2016 was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% primarily attributable to state income taxes, transaction related taxes, and a change in the proportional mix of domestic and international income, partially offset by federal income tax credits for foreign income taxes and research and development costs.\nOur effective income tax rate for 2015 was favorably impacted by an $11.9 million benefit from the completion of the IRS examination of previously filed federal income tax refund claims for Domestic Manufacturing Deductions, research and experimentation credits and capital losses for 2010 as well as other remeasurements during the period.\nExcluding the effect of discrete period items, we currently expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26.5% in 2018. The 2018 tax rate can be affected as a result of variances among the estimates and amounts of 2018 sources of taxable income (e.g., domestic consolidated, joint venture and/or international), the realization of tax credits, adjustments which may arise from the resolution of tax matters under review, our assessment of our liability for uncertain tax positions, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, federal tax regulations and guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act.\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax decreased $243.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased $199.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the sale of our North American Customer Communications business in July 2016, partially offset by the sale of our U.K. Customer Communications business in May 2017. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to the $234.7 million gain, net of tax, on the sale of our North American Customer Communications business partially offset by $17.0 million of goodwill and asset impairments in our U.K. Customer Communications business.\nYEAR TO YEAR BUSINESS SEGMENT COMPARISONS\nDOMESTIC FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\nThe following

revenues\nDomestic Financial Services segment operating revenues of $1,187.2 million reflect an increase of $191.4 million or 19.2% in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the remaining interest in BFDS, which contributed $176.6 million of incremental operating revenues. Excluding the BFDS operating revenues in 2017, operating revenues for the Domestic Financial Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $14.8 million or 1.5%. This increase in operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 was partially due to a $5.0 million increase in revenue at ALPS resulting from an insurance claim reimbursement of $2.0 million received in fourth quarter 2017 as compared to a reduction to ALPS revenue of $3.0 million during 2016 for the processing error that generated the insurance claim. In addition, operating revenues were higher as a result of increased fund flows and higher market performance at ALPS, partially offset by decreased revenues resulting from the exit of certain product offerings and lower subaccounting and mutual fund registered shareowner account processing revenues. Additionally, software license revenues were $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $3.9 million as compared to 2016.\nCosts and expenses\nDomestic Financial Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1,072.2 million, an increase of $243.2 million as compared to 2016. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $111.8 million in 2017, an increase of $38.8 million as compared to 2016.\nExcluding reimbursable operating expenses, Domestic Financial Services costs and expenses increased $204.4 million or 27.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to $176.3 million of incremental costs and expenses from the consolidation of BFDS following the acquisition of the remaining interest in that entity in 2017 and higher share-based compensation expense which increased $25.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year.\nIn addition, costs and expenses increased from higher integration and restructuring costs related to our BFDS acquisition and higher information technology transformation spend partially offset by the non-recurrence of a software impairment recorded in 2016. We recorded restructuring charges of $16.3 million and $10.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we also recognized $11.6 million of expense related to a charitable contribution of our remaining State Street stock.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDomestic Financial Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $86.8 million, an increase of $9.5 million or 12.3% as compared to 2016. The increase in 2017 was primarily attributable to incremental amortization associated with acquired intangibles from the recent acquisitions as well as increased depreciation from capitalized costs incurred to enhance our network infrastructure, security and regulatory compliance.\nOperating income\nDomestic Financial Services segment operating income for 2017 was $140.0 million, a decrease of $22.5 million or 13.8% as compared to 2016. The decrease in Domestic Financial Services operating income was primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense, higher advisory and restructuring costs due to the integration activities for the recently acquired BFDS business and increased depreciation and amortization expense. Operating income also decreased due to an increase in information technology transformation spend, partially offset by higher revenues.\nComparison of 2016 versus 2015 results\nOperating revenues\nDomestic Financial Services segment operating revenues of $995.8 million increased $12.7 million or 1.3% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven from businesses acquired during 2015 and 2016, which contributed $31.8 million of incremental operating revenues. During 2016, we also completed the conversion of approximately 10.0 million subaccounts associated with a previously announced new client, which resulted in incremental revenues. These increases were partly offset by a decline in mutual fund registered shareowner account processing revenue due to lower registered accounts, primarily as a result of subaccounting conversions, and lower revenue due to extending certain long-term contracts with lower pricing. Additionally, software license revenues were $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.9 million as compared to 2015.\nCosts and expenses\nDomestic Financial Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $829.0 million, an increase of $36.7 million as compared to 2015. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $73.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $12.3 million as compared to 2015.\nExcluding reimbursable operating expenses, Domestic Financial Services costs and expenses increased $24.4 million or 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses during 2016 was primarily from acquisitions completed during 2015 and 2016, which included approximately $33.7 million of incremental expenses. Also, contributing to the increase in costs and expenses were the restructuring activities, which resulted in $10.4 million of employee and lease termination costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 to enhance operational efficiency within the Domestic Financial Services segment. We also incurred increased costs to enhance the network infrastructure utilized across all of our operating businesses and incremental costs to service new and existing clients. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also recognized a $6.0 million software impairment. These costs and expenses were partially offset by the reversal of accrued performance-related share-based compensation expense as 2015 PSUs were not expected to achieve the required performance criteria required for vesting and further savings realized from cost containment initiatives.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDomestic Financial Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $77.3 million, an increase of $9.6 million or 14.2% as compared to 2015. The increase in 2016 was primarily attributable to incremental amortization associated with acquired intangibles from the acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2016 as well as increased depreciation from capitalized costs incurred to enhance our network infrastructure and increase security and regulatory compliance. The increase in 2016 was also attributable to the acceleration of depreciation on certain capitalized software during 2016.\nOperating income\nDomestic Financial Services segment operating income for 2016 was $162.5 million, a decrease of $21.3 million or 11.6% as compared to 2015. The decrease in Domestic Financial Services operating income was primarily due to restructuring costs incurred during 2016, a software impairment charge, and increased costs incurred to enhance our network infrastructure, maintain security and regulatory compliance. These decreases were partially offset by the reversal of accrued performance-related share-based compensation expense, higher operating revenues and cost containment efforts during 2016.\nINTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\nThe following table presents the financial results of the International Financial Services segment (in millions):\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>538.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>427.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>385.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Out-of-pocket reimbursements\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>916.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>550.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>438.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>391.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses\n</td> <td>449.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>351.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>357.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>30.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>890.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>553.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>157.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the International Financial Services segment's statistical metrics (in millions, except as noted):\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International mutual fund shareowner accounts processed:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IFDS U.K.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IFDS L.P.

The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by the acquisition of the remaining interest in IFDS U.K., which contributed $425.2 million of incremental operating revenues, including the financial impacts resulting from the termination of a wealth management client agreement. The termination agreement resulted in incremental operating revenues of $93.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as DST accelerated recognition of previously deferred revenue and recognized termination payments received. Additionally, software license revenues were $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.6 million as compared to 2016. These increases were partly offset by lower revenues as a result of the previously discussed client termination in mid-2017 as well as the sale of DST Billing Solutions during 2016.\nCosts and expenses\nInternational Financial Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $449.3 million, an increase of $351.1 million as compared to 2016. Costs and expenses in the International Financial Services segment are primarily comprised of compensation and benefit costs as well as technology-related expenditures. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $12.2 million in 2017, an increase of $11.0 million as compared to 2016.\nExcluding reimbursable operating expenses, International Financial Services costs and expenses increased $340.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. Additionally, in connection with the termination agreement described above, we incurred bad debt expense of $34.5 million for previously invoiced services performed prior to the termination and $5.2 million of other termination-related charges.\nDepreciation and amortization\nInternational Financial Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $30.7 million, an increase of $27.6 million as compared to 2016. The increase in 2017 was primarily attributable to incremental amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of fixed assets from the acquisition of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K.\nOperating income\nInternational Financial Services segment operating income for 2017 was $70.6 million, an increase of $59.8 million or 553.7% as compared to 2016. The increase in International Financial Services operating income was primarily due to the impact of the termination of the wealth management client agreement of $53.5 million, including the recognition of previously deferred revenue and termination payments received as described above. The increase in operating income was also due to the higher revenues resulting from the acquisition of the remaining interest in IFDS U.K., partially offset by higher costs and expenses due to on-going development and implementation efforts for wealth management platform clients, share-based compensation expense, and restructuring charges.\nComparison of 2016 versus 2015 results\nOperating revenues\nInternational Financial Services segment operating revenues of $110.9 million increased $17.5 million or 18.7% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the increased professional services revenues associated with our international wealth management platform business. Software license revenues were $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.1 million as compared to 2015.\nCosts and expenses\nInternational Financial Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $98.2 million, an increase of $12.1 million as compared to 2015. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.5 million as compared to 2015.\nExcluding reimbursable operating expenses, International Financial Services costs and expenses increased $12.6 million or 14.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses during 2016 was primarily from higher staffing costs to support the increase in professional services revenues.\nDepreciation and amortization\nInternational Financial Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $3.1 million, a decrease of $1.7 million or 35.4% as compared to 2015. The decrease in 2016 was primarily attributable to lower depreciation from lower capital expenditures.\nOperating income\nInternational Financial Services segment operating income for 2016 was $10.8 million, an increase of $6.6 million or 157.1% as compared to 2015. The increase in International Financial Services operating income was primarily due to the increased professional services revenues associated with our international wealth management platform business.\nHEALTHCARE SERVICES SEGMENT\nThe following table presents the financial results of the Healthcare Services segment (in millions):\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016 vs 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>418.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>426.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>376.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Out-of-pocket reimbursements\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>426.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>434.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>384.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses\n</td> <td>340.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>345.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>321.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating margin\n</td> <td>17.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following tables summarize the Healthcare Services segment's statistical metrics (in millions):\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DST Health Solutions covered lives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Argus pharmacy paid claims\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>507.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>494.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of 2017 versus 2016 results\nOperating revenues\nHealthcare Services segment operating revenues of $418.5 million decreased $7.7 million or 1.8% in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in operating revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the previously announced client transitions off of our systems, which resulted in approximately $46.5 million of lower revenues. Excluding client migrations, Healthcare Services operating revenues increased by $38.8 million or 10.2%. On this basis, the increase in operating revenues primarily resulted from organic growth and the expansion of the high-value services that we are offering to existing clients in both the medical and pharmacy businesses. These increases were partially offset by reductions in membership related to exchanges and lower consulting and development revenues which we believe is the result of a decline in healthcare technology spending due to the ongoing uncertainty around government policy changes. Additionally, operating revenues included approximately $9.8 million of software license fee revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.8 million as compared to 2016.\nCosts and expenses\nHealthcare Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $340.9 million, a decrease of $4.2 million as compared to 2016. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $7.5 million in 2017, a decrease of $1.0 million as compared to 2016. Excluding reimbursable operating expenses, costs and expenses were $333.4 million for 2017, a decrease of $3.2 million as compared to 2016. On this basis, the decrease in costs and expenses during 2017 was primarily due to lower staffing needs resulting from the previously announced client migrations, partially offset by increased restructuring charges and increased share-based compensation expense. We recorded $4.4 million of restructing charges in 2017, as compared to none in 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization\nHealthcare Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $10.5 million, a decrease of $5.1 million or 32.7% as compared to 2016. The decrease is attributable to lower capital expenditures and an intangible asset becoming fully amortized during 2017.\nOperating income\nHealthcare Services segment operating income for 2017 was $74.6 million, an increase of $0.6 million or 0.8% as compared to 2016. The slight increase in operating income was primarily attributable to organic growth and the expansion of the high-value services that we are offering to existing clients in both the medical and pharmacy businesses and decreases in depreciation and amortization. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact of client migrations, restructuring charges, and increased share-based compensation expenses.\nComparison of 2016 versus 2015 results\nOperating revenues\nHealthcare Services segment operating revenues of $426.2 million increased $49.8 million or 13.2% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily from new medical claims processing clients implemented during 2016, organic growth and the expansion of high-value services we are offering to existing clients in both the medical and pharmacy businesses. Operating revenues included approximately $8.0 million of software license fee revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.1 million as compared to 2015.\nCosts and expenses\nHealthcare Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $345.1 million, an increase of $23.8 million as compared to 2015. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $8.5 million in 2016, an increase of $0.3 million as compared to 2015. Excluding reimbursable operating expenses, costs and expenses were $336.6 million for 2016, an increase of $23.5 million as compared to 2015. On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses during 2016 was primarily attributable to increased staffing costs incurred to support the higher medical transaction volumes due to the growth in BPO services. These costs and expenses were partially offset by restructuring costs that occurred during 2015 that did not recur during 2016 and a $2.4 million reduction of share-based compensation expense as certain PSUs were no longer expected to vest.\nDepreciation and amortization\nHealthcare Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $15.6 million, a decrease of $3.0 million or 16.1% as compared to 2015 primarily due to lower capital expenditures.\nOperating income\nHealthcare Services segment operating income for 2016 was $74.0 million, an increase of $29.3 million or 65.5% as compared to 2015. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to higher revenues from organic growth and new medical claims processing clients implemented in 2016, resulting in enhanced economies of scale as clients were converted as well as a reduction of share-based compensation expense as certain PSUs were no longer expected to vest. These increases were partially offset by increased staffing costs incurred to support the higher medical transaction volumes due to the growth in BPO services.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCompany's Assessment of Short-term and Long-term Liquidity\nWe believe that our existing cash balances and other current assets, together with cash provided by operating activities and, as necessary, our revolving credit facilities, are sufficient to meet our operating and debt service requirements and other current liabilities for at least the next 12 months. Further, we believe that our longer term liquidity and capital requirements will also be met through cash provided by operating activities, bank credit facilities and other investments.\nAt December 31, 2017, total cash and cash equivalents were $80.5 million, of which $46.0 million was held outside of the U.S. Although the amounts held outside the U.S. have been taxed through the Transition Tax, these amounts could be subject to other taxes such as withholding taxes and local taxes. We have accrued for withholding taxes and local taxes on the earnings of our international subsidiaries except when the earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. The repatriation of these earnings could result in additional withholding and local tax payments in future years. We utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had approximately $990.7 million of availability under our domestic revolving credit facilities, including our accounts receivable securitization program. Debt obligations, classified as long-term when originally issued, existing as of December 31, 2017 that are scheduled to mature in 2018 include $65.0 million of Series C 2010 Senior Notes that are scheduled to mature in August 2018 and $3.7 million of payments related to outstanding mortgages. We are scheduled\nto issue $65.0 million of Series C 2017 Senior Notes in August 2018 which are expected to be utilized to repay the Series C 2010 Senior Notes.\nWe may need to access debt and equity markets in the future if unforeseen costs or opportunities arise, to fund acquisitions or investments or to repay indebtedness. If we need to obtain new debt or equity financing in the future, the terms and availability of such financing may be impacted by economic and financial market conditions as well as our financial condition and results of operations at the time we seek additional financing. We currently have $585.0 million of additional capacity pursuant to the master note purchase agreement dated November 14, 2017 that could be utilized for future debt issuances.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe had $80.5 million, $195.5 million and $79.5 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our primary source of liquidity has historically been cash provided by operations. In addition, we have used proceeds from the sale of investments to fund other investing and financing activities. Principal uses of cash are operations, reinvestment in our proprietary technologies, capital expenditures, investment purchases, business acquisitions, payments on debt, stock repurchases and dividend payments. Additionally, we expect to incur significant transaction costs associated with the completion of the Merger. Information on our consolidated cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, categorized by operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.\nThe sale of our North American Customer Communications business on July 1, 2016 and our U.K. Customer Communications business on May 4, 2017 resulted in cash consideration of approximately $410.7 million and $43.6 million, respectively, net of tax. The after-tax proceeds from the sales were used in accordance with the Company's capital plan, including investments in the business, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, debt repayments and other corporate purposes.\nOperating Activities\nCash flows provided from continuing operating activities were $164.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating cash flows from continuing operating activities during 2017 resulted principally from income from continuing operations of $447.6 million, adjusted for non-cash or non-operating items of $108.2 million including depreciation and amortization, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net gains on investments and gains recognized on the step up of the carrying value of our previously held equity interests in unconsolidated affiliates as a result of the acquisitions of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K., and a use of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $175.4 million. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities include a $127.9 million use of cash related to other assets primarily due to up-front payments made to clients which are expected to be recovered over the clients' contractual arrangements and higher prepaid software costs, a $39.9 million use of cash for accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and a $29.6 million use of cash related to deferred revenue and gains primarily as a result of the wealth management platform client termination.\nCash flows provided from continuing operating activities were $162.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating cash flows from continuing operations during 2016 resulted principally from income from continuing operations of $178.1 million, adjusted for non-cash or non-operating items of $90.4 million including depreciation and amortization and equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, and a use of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $105.8 million. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities include a $26.9 million use of cash related to accrued compensation and benefits, a $16.6 million source of cash resulting from accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a $16.0 million use of cash related to accounts receivable, and a $67.9 million use of cash related to timing of income tax payments.\nCash flows provided from continuing operating activities were $135.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating cash flows from continuing operating activities during 2015 resulted principally from income from continuing operations of $309.6 million, adjusted for non-cash or non-operating items of $110.3 million including depreciation and amortization, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and net gains on investments, and a use of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $63.6 million. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities include a $10.6 million use of cash related to accounts receivable, and a $31.6 million use of cash related to timing of income tax payments.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in continuing investing activities were $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Sources of our cash inflows were net investment activities (proceeds from investment sales, net of investments in securities) of $39.8 million, fluctuations in funds held on behalf of clients of $43.3 million and distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates of $32.7 million, primarily from IFDS L.P in connection with the acquisition of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K., offset by cash used to acquire IFDS U.K. (net of cash acquired) of $38.9 million and capital expenditures of $78.8 million.\nCash flows used in continuing investing activities during 2016 of $117.3 million were primarily attributable to net investment activities (proceeds from investment sales, net of investments in securities) of $59.5 million, offset by cash used to acquire KRFS of $93.5 million, capital expenditures of $60.4 million, fluctuations in funds held on behalf of clients of $20.3 million, as well as approximately $28.0 million of cash loaned to IFDS U.K. during 2016.\nCash flows used in continuing investing activities were $102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily attributable to net investment activities (proceeds from investment sales, net of investments in securities) of $192.2 million, which includes $176.1 million of pretax proceeds from the sale of State Street stock. These sources of cash were offset by $117.4 million of cash used to acquire kasina LLC, Red Rocks Capital LLC and Wealth Management Systems, Inc. during 2015, $88.9 million used to purchase capital assets, as well as $113.5 million due to fluctuations in funds held on behalf of clients.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following table summarizes capital expenditures by segment (in millions):\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic Financial Services segment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International Financial Services segment\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare Services segment\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2017, 2016 and 2015, we capitalized software development costs of $24.1 million, $21.5 million and $23.3 million, respectively, which are included within the capital expenditures listed above. Capital expenditures using debt are treated as non-cash transactions and are not included in the annual capital expenditure amounts above.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows used in continuing financing activities totaled $317.4 million, $374.8 million and $278.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCommon Stock Issuances and Repurchases\nWe received cash proceeds of $2.8 million, $5.3 million and $11.8 million from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of employee stock options during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The value of shares received in exchange for satisfaction of the exercise price and for tax-withholding obligations arising from the exercise of options to purchase our stock or from the vesting of restricted shares are included in Common stock repurchased in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $150.0 million of capacity remaining under our share repurchase plan authorized in 2016. On May 9, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new $300.0 million share repurchase plan, which allows, but does not require, the repurchase of common stock in open market and private transactions. We repurchased the equivalent of 5.0 million shares of our common stock on a post stock split basis for $300.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, which left approximately $150.0 million remaining under our share repurchase plan authorized in 2017. The 2017 share repurchase plan does not have an expiration date, however we are currently precluded from executing additional stock repurchases pursuant to the Merger Agreement with SS&C. Under previous share repurchase plans, we expended $300.0 million for approximately 5.4 million shares on a post stock split basis and $400.0 million for approximately 7.2 million shares on a post stock split basis during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDividends\nWe paid cash dividends of $0.72, $0.66 and $0.60 per common share in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The total cash paid for dividends in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $43.7 million, $43.4 million and $43.1 million, respectively. We are currently precluded from declaring dividends pursuant to the Merger Agreement with SS&C.\nClient Funds Obligations\nClient funds obligations represent our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client pharmacy claim obligations and are recorded on the balance sheet when incurred, generally after a claim has been processed by us. In addition, client funds obligations include transfer agency client balances invested overnight. Our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client obligations are primarily sourced by funds held on behalf of clients. We had $504.2 million, $564.6 million and $533.4 million of client funds obligations at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDebt Activity\nDuring 2017, we had the following primary sources of debt financing: our syndicated revolving credit facility; accounts receivable securitization program; and privately placed senior notes (the 2010 Senior Notes\u201d and 2017 Senior Notes\u201d). We had $620.8 million, $508.2 million and $562.1 million of debt outstanding at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $112.6 million during 2017 and a decrease of $53.9 million during 2016.\nThe increase in debt outstanding during 2017 resulted primarily from issuing $350.0 million of 2017 Senior Notes in November 2017, the assumption of a mortgage as a result of the acquisition of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. and the assumption of a mortgage associated with a real estate distribution from Broadway Square Partners, partially offset by a reduction in amounts outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization program and revolving credit facilities. Proceeds from the 2017 Senior Notes were primarily used to pay down our revolving credit facilities. The decrease in debt outstanding during 2016 resulted primarily from the utilization of the proceeds from the sale of our North American Customer Communications business to pay down outstanding balances, partially offset by borrowings to fund the KRFS business acquisition, share repurchases and working capital uses.\nOur debt agreements contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on consolidated indebtedness, liens, investments, subsidiary indebtedness, asset dispositions and require certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios to be maintained. We are currently in compliance with these covenants. A default under certain of our borrowings could trigger defaults under certain of our other debt obligations, which in turn could result in their maturities being accelerated. Our debt arrangements are further described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10, Debt.\u201d\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017 (in millions):\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>623.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>350.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>104.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software license agreements\n</td> <td>135.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>39.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>901.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>302.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>368.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest obligations on our outstanding debt are not included in the table above. The syndicated revolving credit facility contains grid schedules that adjust borrowing costs up or down based upon our consolidated leverage ratio. The grid schedules may result in fluctuations in borrowing costs ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% over Eurodollar and 0.00% to 0.70% over base rate, as defined. The 2010 Senior Notes outstanding have fixed interest rates and are comprised of $65.0 million of 5.06% Series C Senior Notes and $160.0 million of 5.42% Series D Senior Notes. The $350.0 million of 2017 Senior Notes outstanding have an average fixed interest rate of approximately 4.0%. In addition to the financial instruments listed above, the program fees incurred on proceeds from the sale of receivables under our accounts receivable securitization program are determined based on variable interest rates associated with LIBOR plus an applicable margin.\nWe have liabilities for income tax uncertainties of $67.7 million at December 31, 2017. These obligations are classified as non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as resolution of these matters is expected to take more than a year; however, the ultimate timing of resolution is uncertain. As we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits, our liability for income tax uncertainties is not included in the table above.\nDue to the enactment of the Tax Act, we recorded a provisional income tax payable related to the Transition Tax of $8.4 million, of which $7.3 million is reported as noncurrent as it is not expected to be paid within one year. As permitted by the Tax Act, the Transition Tax will be paid over an eight-year period, beginning in 2018, and will not accrue interest. This\nprovisional amount, as well as the current estimated timing of payments, is subject to change based on additional guidance from and interpretations by U.S. regulatory and standard-setting bodies and changes in assumptions.\nOther Commercial Commitments\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products and other business assets, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. At December 31, 2017, except for certain immaterial items, there were no liabilities for guarantees or indemnifications as it is not possible to determine either the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements or the timing of any such payments due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSS&C Merger Agreement\nUnder certain circumstances, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $165.0 million to SS&C in the event the Merger Agreement with SS&C is terminated.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAn off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company.\nWe believe that our guarantee arrangements will not have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, capital expenditures, capital resources, liquidity or results of operations. These arrangements are described above and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains forward-looking statements\u201d - that is, statements related to future, not past, events. In this context, forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d believe,\u201d seek,\u201d see,\u201d will,\u201d would,\u201d or target.\u201d Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain.\nFor us, particular risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements include:\n \u2022 the effects of competition in the businesses in which we operate; \n \u2022 changes in client demand and our ability to provide products and services on terms that are favorable to us; \n \u2022 changes in law, economic and financial conditions; \n \u2022 the impacts of breaches or potential breaches of network, information technology or data security, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or acts of war or significant litigation and any resulting financial impact not covered by insurance; \n \u2022 the effectiveness of our risk management framework; \n \u2022 the impact of regulation and regulatory, investigative and legal proceedings and legal compliance risks, including the impact of financial services regulation and litigation and potential SEC or DOL regulations impacting third-party distributors of mutual funds; \n \u2022 our investments in funds and other companies may decline; \n \u2022 our ability to successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses; \n \u2022 the risk that the proposed Merger with SS&C will not be consummated within the expected time period or at all, including the risk that the Company may be unable to obtain stockholder approval as required for the Merger and conditions to the closing of the Merger may not be satisfied or waived on a timely basis or otherwise; \n \u2022 the risk that a governmental entity or a regulatory body may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant approval for the consummation of the Merger and may require conditions, limitations or restrictions in connection with such approvals that can adversely affect the anticipated benefits of the proposed Merger or cause the parties to abandon the proposed Merger; \n \u2022 the risk that the business of the Company may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the Merger or the potential adverse changes to business relationships resulting from the proposed Merger; \n \u2022 the risk that the Merger may involve unexpected costs, liabilities or delays; \n \u2022 the risk that legal proceedings may be initiated related to the Merger and the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the Merger may be adverse to the Company; and \n \u2022 the other factors that are described in Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d of this Form 10-K. \nThese or other uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements. This document includes certain forward-looking projected financial information that is based on current estimates and forecasts. Actual results could differ materially.\nFuture economic and industry trends that could potentially impact our financial statements or results of operations are difficult to predict. These forward-looking statements are based on information as of the date of this report. We assume no obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized, except as may be required by law.\nIntroduction\nDST Systems, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries use proprietary software applications to provide sophisticated information processing and servicing solutions through strategically unified data management and business process solutions to clients globally within the asset management, brokerage, retirement, healthcare and other markets. Our wholly-owned data centers provide the secure technology infrastructure necessary to support our solutions. In order to position the Company to take advantage of new and emerging technologies, we are embarking on an information technology transformation effort which will increase our operating expenses for the near term. We expect these investments will result in lower centralized infrastructure costs and a more agile platform on which to deliver future capabilities.\nOn January 11, 2018, we entered into a Merger Agreement wherein SS&C will acquire DST. Under the terms of the agreement, SS&C will purchase DST in an all-cash transaction for $84.00 per share plus the assumption of debt, equating to an enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion. We have agreed to customary covenants in the Merger Agreement, including with respect to the operation of our business prior to the closing of the transaction or termination of the agreement, such as\nrestrictions on making certain acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and expenditures, paying dividends, repurchasing stock and taking other specified actions. The transaction is subject to DST stockholder approval, clearances by the relevant regulatory authorities and other customary closing conditions and is currently expected to close by the end of the second quarter 2018; however, there can be no assurances as to the actual closing or the timing of the closing. Consummation of the proposed Merger would constitute a change of control of DST under the partnership agreement of IFDS L.P. and, as a result, the other partner would have the option to purchase our interests in IFDS L.P. at a price equal to book value, unless another purchase provision in the partnership agreement was triggered prior to the change of control.\nIn March 2017, we acquired State Street's ownership interests in our joint ventures BFDS and IFDS U.K., as well as other investments and real estate held by IFDS L.P. The BFDS acquisition was effectuated through a non-taxable exchange of our State Street common stock with a fair value of $163.4 million for State Street's ownership interest in BFDS. We also acquired State Street's ownership interest in IFDS U.K., and IFDS L.P.'s ownership in IFDS Percana and IFDS Realty U.K. for total cash consideration of $234.9 million.\nIn May 2017, we completed the sale of our U.K. Customer Communications business for cash consideration of $43.6 million. We recorded a pretax gain of $2.6 million on the sale during 2017. We sold our North American Customer Communications business for cash consideration of $410.7 million on July 1, 2016 and we recorded a pretax gain of $341.5 million on the sale in 2016. We have classified the results of the businesses sold as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. The net after-tax proceeds from these sales are being used in accordance with the Company's capital plan, including investments in the business, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, debt repayments and other corporate purposes, subject to the restrictions set forth in the Merger Agreement with SS&C.\nBeginning in 2017, DST established a new reportable segment structure that reflects how management is now operating the business and making resource allocations following the acquisitions of IFDS U.K. and BFDS, as well as the recent reductions in non-core investment assets. The Company's operating business units are now reported as three operating segments (Domestic Financial Services, International Financial Services and Healthcare Services). Prior periods have been revised to reflect the new reportable operating segments.\nDomestic Financial Services Segment\nThrough the Domestic Financial Services segment, we provide investor, investment, advisor/intermediary and asset distribution services to companies within the U.S. financial services industry. Utilizing our proprietary software applications, we offer our clients information processing solutions that enable them to capture, analyze and report their investors' transactions including direct and intermediary sales of mutual funds, alternative investments, securities brokerage accounts and retirement plans. Examples of the services we provide include tracking of purchases, redemptions, exchanges and transfers of shares; maintaining investor identification and ownership records; reconciling cash and share activity; processing dividends; reporting sales; and performing tax and other compliance functions. We also support full reporting to investors for confirmations, statements and tax forms, web access, and electronic delivery of documents.\nServices are provided either on a Remote or BPO basis utilizing our proprietary software applications. Our BPO service offerings are enhanced by our proprietary workflow software, which is also licensed separately to third parties.\nDomestic Financial Services fees are primarily charged to the client based on the number of accounts, participants or transactions processed. For subaccounts, a portion of the services we provide for registered accounts are provided directly by the broker/dealer. As a result, our revenue per account is generally higher for registered accounts than for subaccounts. On a more limited basis, we also generate revenue through asset-based fee arrangements and from investment earnings related to cash balances maintained in our full service transfer agency bank accounts. We typically have multi-year agreements with our clients. We are continuing to monitor changes in the financial services industry, including the shift from direct products to fee-based platforms which could reduce the number of direct mutual fund registered accounts we service.\nIn December 2017, we entered into a ten year contract with a new client to provide both mutual fund and retirement servicing solutions. Based on current volumes, the client is expected to convert approximately 2.0 million registered accounts and 0.3 million retirement accounts onto our platforms during mid to late 2019. This new client currently performs their processing in-house and in order to assist the new client with covering the costs to transition to our platforms we have agreed to pay them $13.0 million in transition assistance during the conversion, of which $2.0 million was paid in December 2017. The total amounts will be amortized as a reduction to revenue over the course of the ten year contractual term.\nAdditionally in December 2017, we renewed our largest Domestic Financial Services client to a new seven year contract. Based upon our new rate structure, we expect our operating revenue in 2018 associated with this client to be relatively consistent with the 2017 revenue.\nAs part of the continuing strategic review of our operations, we decided not to renew a long-term surety bond insurance agreement which expired in December 2017 as the proposed revised terms were no longer economically advantageous. This agreement historically generated approximately $14.0 million of annual revenue.\nOn February 24, 2016, we acquired all of the membership interests of Kaufman Rossin Fund Services LLC ( KRFS\u201d), an independent, full-service provider of specialized hedge fund administration services to the global financial community. KRFS' hedge fund services include accounting and valuation, back-office outsourcing, investor services, treasury services, and customized reporting.\nDuring 2015, we acquired all of the membership interests of kasina LLC, a strategic advisory firm to the asset management industry, and Red Rocks Capital LLC, an asset manager which focuses on listed private equity and other private asset investments. In 2015, we also acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Wealth Management Systems Inc., a provider of technology-based rollover services in the retirement marketplace.\nIn December 2015, we entered into a ten year contract with a new client to provide both subaccounting and mutual fund servicing solutions. The client converted approximately 10.0 million subaccounts onto our platform during 2016 and converted approximately 2.6 million registered accounts onto our platform during the third quarter of 2017.\nInternational Financial Services Segment\nWe offer investor and policyholder administration and technology services on a Remote and BPO basis in the U.K. and, through our joint venture IFDS L.P., in Canada, Ireland, and Luxembourg. Additionally, in Australia and in the U.K., we provide solutions related to participant accounting and recordkeeping for wealth management, wrap platforms\u201d and retirement savings ( superannuation\u201d) industries/markets through use of our wealth management platform and our life and pension administration system.\nOur primary clients are mutual fund managers, insurers and platform providers. International Financial Services fees are primarily charged to the client based on the number of accounts or transactions processed. We also realize revenues from fixed-fee license agreements that include provisions for ongoing support and maintenance and for additional license payments in the event that usage increases. Additionally, we derive professional service revenues from fees for implementation services, custom programming and data center operations. We typically have multi-year agreements with our clients.\nIn November 2016, we sold a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary that provides water billing software and services solutions for cash consideration of approximately $6.1 million. This business had approximately $5.4 million of operating revenue and $1.2 million of operating income on an annual basis. As these decisions were the result of a tactical review of our products and services, and not the result of a significant shift in strategic direction, the revenue and operating income from these products and services are included within our continuing operations.\nDuring 2017, we reached a termination agreement with a wealth management platform client who had engaged us for a multi-year development and implementation effort as well as post-implementation services. The termination agreement resulted in incremental operating revenues of $93.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as we accelerated recognition of previously deferred revenue and recognized termination payments received. Additionally, our International Financial Services segment has been notified that two of our clients, which have collectively contributed approximately $33.0 million of annual revenue, will be migrating off our FAST platform in stages through the end of 2018.\nHealthcare Services Segment\nThe Healthcare Services segment uses our proprietary software applications to provide healthcare organizations a variety of medical and pharmacy benefit solutions to satisfy their information processing, quality of care, cost management concerns and payment integrity programs, while achieving compliance and improving operational efficiencies. Our healthcare solutions include claims adjudication, benefit management, care management, business intelligence and other ancillary services. We also continue to expand and enhance our Healthcare Services' offerings to ensure we are able to address the changing needs of our clients within the complex and highly regulated health industries which we serve. For example, our pharmacy management business continues to make investments to expand our clinical, network, and analytic capabilities to help our clients and prospective clients achieve the best possible outcomes for their members and to allow us to more effectively compete in the broader competitive pharmacy benefit manager ( PBM\u201d) market. Historically, we have acted as an agent within our pharmacy-solutions business and, accordingly, recognized revenue on a net basis. As our enhanced products evolve and we expand our pharmacy-solutions service offerings, we will evaluate the provisions within our new pharmacy network and client contracts to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent in the transactions. If we determine that we are acting as a principal in the transactions, we will report the transactions on a gross basis, resulting in significantly higher revenues and costs reflected within our consolidated financial statements.\nWe generally derive revenue from our pharmacy-solutions business on a transactional fee basis. Fees are earned on pharmacy claims processing and payments services, pharmacy and member call center services, pharmaceutical rebate administration, administration or management of clinical programs, pharmacy network management, member and plan web services and management information and reporting. Further, revenues include investment earnings related to client cash balances maintained in our bank accounts. Medical claim processing revenues are generally derived from fees charged on a per member/per month basis or transactional basis. We also realize revenue from fixed-fee license agreements that include provisions for ongoing support and maintenance and for additional license payments in the event that usage or members increase. Additionally, we derive professional service revenues from fees for implementation services, custom programming and data center operations.\nDuring 2017, we renewed our pharmacy services contract with our Healthcare Services segment's third largest client extending the term of the contract through December 31, 2020. As previously announced, two of our Healthcare Services clients transitioned their services off our systems during 2017. Additionally, we have been notified that one of our largest Healthcare Services clients, which contributed approximately $50.0 million of annual revenue, will be migrating off our medical claims processing platform in stages through the end of 2019.\nSeasonality\nGenerally, we do not have significant seasonal fluctuations in our business operations. Processing volumes for mutual fund clients within our Domestic and International Financial Services segment are usually highest during the quarter ended March 31 due primarily to processing year-end transactions during January. We have historically added operating equipment in the last half of the year in preparation for processing year-end transactions, which has the effect of increasing costs for the second half of the year. Revenues and operating results from individual license sales vary depending on the timing and size of the contracts.\nNew Authoritative Accounting Guidance\nSee Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies - New authoritative accounting guidance.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: revenue recognition; software capitalization and amortization; depreciation of fixed assets; valuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill; accounting for investments; and accounting for income taxes.\nRevenue recognition\nWe recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and it is earned. The majority of our revenues are derived from computer processing and services and are recognized upon completion of the services provided. Software license fees, maintenance fees and other ancillary fees are recognized as services are provided or delivered and all client obligations have been met. We generally do not have payment terms from clients that extend beyond one year. Billing for services in advance of performance is recorded as deferred revenue.\nWe recognize revenue when the following criteria are met: 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; 3) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and 4) collectability is reasonably assured. If there is a client-specific acceptance provision in a contract or if there is uncertainty about client acceptance, the associated revenue is deferred until we have evidence of client acceptance.\nRevenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables (items) can be divided into more than one unit of accounting. An item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met: 1) the delivered item(s) has value to the client on a standalone basis and 2) if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item(s), delivery or performance of the undelivered item(s) is considered probable and substantially in our control. Once separate units of accounting are determined, the arrangement consideration\nshould be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. Relative selling price is obtained from sources such as vendor-specific objective evidence, which is based on the separate selling price for that or a similar item or from third-party evidence such as how competitors have priced similar items. If such evidence is unavailable, we use our best estimate of the selling price, which includes various internal factors such as our pricing strategy and market factors.\nWe derive over 90% of our revenues as a result of providing processing and services under contracts. The majority of our fees are billed on a monthly basis, generally with thirty-day collection terms. Revenues are recognized for monthly processing and services upon performance of the services.\nOur standard business practice is to bill monthly for development, consulting and training services on a time and materials basis. In some cases we bill a fixed fee for development and consulting services. For fixed fee arrangements, we recognize revenue on a proportionate performance\u201d basis. We periodically provide upfront cash payments to our clients to assist with the significant upfront costs associated with converting to new systems. Such payments are treated as a reduction of revenue over the term of the related contract.\nWe derive less than 10% of our revenues from licensing products. We license our wealth management products, life and pension administration system, AWD products and healthcare administration processing software solutions. Perpetual software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed, the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist. Deferral of software license revenue billed results from delayed payment provisions, disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services. Term software license revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the license agreement. While license fee revenues are not a significant percentage of our total operations, they can significantly impact earnings in the period in which they are recognized. Revenues from individual license sales depend heavily on the timing, size and nature of the contract. We recognize revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term, after collectability has been reasonably assured.\nWe may enter into arrangements with broker/dealers or other third parties to sell or market closed-end fund shares. Depending on the arrangement, we may earn distribution fees for marketing and selling the underlying fund shares. Conversely, we may incur distribution expenses, including structuring fees, finders' fees and referral fees paid to unaffiliated broker/dealers or introducing parties for marketing and selling underlying fund shares of a closed-end fund we sponsor. While distribution revenues and expenses are not significant percentages of our operating revenues or costs and expenses, they can significantly impact operations and earnings in the period in which they are recognized.\nWe have entered into various agreements with related parties, principally unconsolidated affiliates, under which we have historically provided data processing and software services. We believe that the terms of our contracts with related parties are fair to us and are no less favorable than those obtained from unaffiliated parties.\nWe assess collection based on a variety of factors, including past collection history with the client and the credit-worthiness of the client. We generally do not request collateral from our client. If we determine that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured, revenue is deferred and is recognized at the time it becomes reasonably assured, which is generally upon receipt of cash. Allowances for billing adjustments and bad debt expense are estimated as revenues are recognized. Allowances for billing adjustments are recorded as reductions in revenues and bad debt expense is recorded within Costs and expenses. The annual amounts for these items are generally immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.\nSoftware capitalization and amortization\nWe make substantial investments in software to enhance the functionality and facilitate the delivery of our processing services as well as our sale of licensed products. Purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years. We develop a large portion of our software internally. We capitalize software development costs for computer software developed or obtained for internal use after the preliminary project phase has been completed and management has committed to funding the project. For computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed to third parties, we capitalize software development costs which are incurred after the products reach technological feasibility but prior to the general release of the product to clients. The capitalized software development costs are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally three to five years.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining what projects and costs associated with software development will be capitalized and in assigning estimated economic lives to the completed projects. Management specifically evaluates software development projects and analyzes the percentage of completion as compared to the initial plan and subsequent forecasts, milestones achieved and the commitment to continue funding the projects. Significant changes in any of these items may result in discontinuing capitalization of development costs, as well as immediately expensing previously capitalized costs. We review, on a quarterly basis, our capitalized software for possible impairment.\nDepreciation of fixed assets\nFor personal property, we generally prefer to own rather than lease the property when practicable. We believe this approach provides us with better flexibility for disposing or redeploying the asset as it nears the completion of its economic life. We depreciate technology equipment using accelerated depreciation methods over the following lives: (1) non-mainframe equipment-three years; (2) mainframe central processing unit-four years; and (3) mainframe direct access storage devices-five years. We depreciate furniture and fixtures over estimated useful lives, principally three to five years, using accelerated depreciation methods. We depreciate leasehold improvements using the straight-line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or life of the improvements. Management judgment is required in assigning economic lives to fixed assets. Management specifically analyzes fixed asset additions, remaining net book values and gain/loss upon disposition of fixed assets to determine the appropriateness of assigned economic lives. Significant changes in any of these items may result in changes in the economic life assigned and the resulting depreciation expense.\nValuation of long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment. We evaluate the impairment of goodwill at least annually (as of October 1) and evaluate identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and related assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following: significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our strategy for the overall business; and significant negative industry or economic trends. When it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we assess actual impairment based on cash flows.\nOur assessment of goodwill for impairment may first include a qualitative assessment that considers various factors, including those described above as well as growth in operating revenues and income from operations of our reporting units since our last quantitative assessment. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if a qualitative assessment is not performed.\nOur quantitative assessment of goodwill for impairment includes comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value, including goodwill. We estimate fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow models and market approaches. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. After a goodwill impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill becomes its new accounting basis.\nOur 2017, 2016 and 2015 annual goodwill impairment tests determined that goodwill was not impaired, except during 2016 for the goodwill held at the Customer Communications U.K. reporting unit, which is included as a component of discontinued operations, as further described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data - Note 4, Discontinued Operations.\u201d\nAccounting for investments\nWe have four significant types of investments: 1) investments in available-for-sale securities; 2) investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are comprised principally of IFDS L.P. and certain real estate joint ventures; 3) investments in private equity funds and other investments accounted for under the cost method; and 4) seed capital investments accounted for at fair value.\nWe account for investments in entities in which we own less than 20% and do not have significant influence in accordance with authoritative guidance related to accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, which requires us to designate our investments as trading or available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to Accumulated other comprehensive income within Stockholders' equity.\nWe regularly review investment securities for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds fair value, the duration of any market decline, and the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer. We record an investment impairment charge for an investment with a gross unrealized holding loss resulting from a decline in value that is other than temporary. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment's current carrying value, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on our financial position.\nThe equity method of accounting is used for investments in entities, partnerships and similar interests (including investments in private equity funds where we are the limited partner) in which we have significant influence but do not control. We classify\nthese investments as unconsolidated affiliates. Under the equity method, we recognize income or losses from our pro-rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates' net income or loss, which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate. In certain cases, pro-rata losses are recognized only to the extent of our investment and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate.\nThe cost method of accounting is used for these investments when we have a de minimis ownership percentage and do not have significant influence. Our cost method investments are held at the lower of cost or market.\nAccounting for income taxes\nWe account for income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof).\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), resulting in significant modifications to existing U.S. tax law, including but not limited to, (1) lowering the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018; (2) eliminating the domestic production activity deduction; (3) implementing a territorial tax system; and (4) imposing a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) which provides additional clarification in situations where we do not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act for the reporting period in which the Tax Act was enacted. We have recognized the provisional tax impacts, based on reasonable estimates, related to the one-time deemed mandatory repatriation of post-1986 undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through the year ended December 31, 2017 ( Transition Tax\u201d) and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and has included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act. We intend to complete our accounting under the Tax Act within the measurement period set forth in SAB 118.\nIn addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for potential tax exposures based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be required. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, then we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is more likely than not that our positions will be sustained if challenged by the taxing authorities. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given period may be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require cash payments and may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. We report interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions within income tax expense.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results (in millions). Additional information regarding our segments is included below under the caption, Year to Year Business Segment Comparisons.\u201d\n\nRevenues\nConsolidated total revenues (including out-of-pocket ( OOP\u201d) reimbursements) increased $661.5 million or 42.5% during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 and increased $82.7 million or 5.6% during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Consolidated operating revenues increased $612.3 million or 41.5% in 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K. in 2017 which collectively contributed $601.8 million of incremental operating revenue during 2017. Consolidated operating revenues increased $69.4 million or 4.9% in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily as a result of the acquisitions of KRFS in February 2016, Red Rocks Capital LLC in July 2015 and Wealth Management Systems Inc. in August 2015.\nPrior to the acquisitions of BFDS and IFDS U.K., we received revenues for processing services and products provided under agreements with these entities. Our operating revenues derived from sales to these entities were $138.5 million and $134.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and $35.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The operating results of BFDS and IFDS U.K. were consolidated within our operating results subsequent to the acquisition dates.\nConsolidated OOP reimbursements increased $49.2 million or 59.8% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased $13.3 million or 19.3% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in consolidated OOP reimbursements in 2017 is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K. The increase in consolidated OOP reimbursements in 2016 is primarily attributable to increased client volumes in the Domestic Financial Services segment.\nCosts and expenses\nConsolidated costs and expenses (including OOP reimbursements) increased $591.6 million or 48.8% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased $63.2 million or 5.5% in 2016 as compared to 2015. Costs and expenses are primarily comprised of compensation and benefit costs, reimbursable operating expenses, information technology spend and professional fees. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $131.5 million, $82.3 million and $69.0 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding reimbursable operating expenses, costs and expenses increased $542.4 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased $49.9 million in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nThe increase in costs and expenses in 2017, exclusive of reimbursable expenses, is primarily attributable to the consolidation of BFDS and IFDS U.K. following the acquisitions of the remaining interests in these entities during 2017. Share-based compensation expense increased $31.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily driven by the prior year reversal of accrued performance-related share-based compensation expense as 2015 PSUs were not expected to achieve the required performance criteria combined with increased share-based compensation expense in 2017 related to 2016 and 2017 PSUs that are currently expected to vest at a higher conversion rate than target. In addition, we recorded increased bad debt expense and a significant charitable contribution transaction in 2017.\nAs a result of changes in our business environment, including the transition of certain Health Services clients off of our systems, the termination of a wealth management client in the International Financial Services segment, and the acquisitions of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K., we have implemented restructuring initiatives to right-size our organization and enhance operational efficiencies, as well as achieve synergies from our recent acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred pretax restructuring charges primarily related to employee terminations and related costs of $23.4 million in Costs and expenses. Annualized savings achieved from the actions taken from March 2017 through October 2017 are currently expected to be approximately $22.0 million within the Domestic Financial Services segment, approximately $7.0 million within the International Financial Services segment and approximately $13.0 million within the Healthcare Services segment.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $10.4 million and $3.4 million of pretax restructuring charges, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization\nConsolidated depreciation and amortization increased $32.0 million or 33.3% during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of the acquisitions of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K. and increased $4.9 million or 5.4% during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the acquisition of KRFS.\nOperating income\nConsolidated operating income increased $37.9 million or 15.3% to $285.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased $14.6 million or 6.3% to $247.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense was $26.8 million, $23.5 million and $23.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense increased 14.0% during 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to higher borrowings as a result of the acquisition of IFDS U.K. and higher borrowing rates on the $350.0 million of debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2017. Interest expense decreased 1.3% during 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily from lower weighted average debt balances outstanding.\nGain on sale of business\nOn November 1, 2016, we sold DST Billing Solutions Limited ( Billing Solutions\u201d) for cash consideration of approximately $6.1 million. Operating revenue and income generated for the Billing Solutions business sold was approximately $4.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016. We recorded a pretax gain of $5.5 million on the sale of the business during 2016.\nOther income, net\nThe components of other income, net are as follows (in millions):\n\nIncluded in the net realized gains from the disposition of available-for-sale securities during 2015 were gains of $157.3 million from the sale of approximately 2.3 million shares of State Street common stock as compared to no sales of State Street shares during 2016. We recognized a realized gain of $145.1 million from the exchange of State Street common stock for the remaining interests in BFDS in 2017. We also recognized a realized gain of $10.4 million from the charitable contribution of our remaining State Street shares in 2017. Additionally, as a result of the 2017 acquisitions, we recorded a net pretax gain of $43.8 million on the step-up of our previous 50% ownership interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K. during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe recorded a net gain on private equity funds and other investments of $15.4 million, $16.5 million and $35.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to distributions received from certain of our private equity fund investments resulting in realized gains. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments and may require an impairment charge in the future, which could have a material effect on our net income.\nWe receive dividend income from certain investments held. The decline in dividend income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by our reduction of our investment in State Street common stock in March 2017. Dividends received from State Street common stock were $0.1 million, $3.1 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is as follows (in millions):\n\nEquity in earnings of IFDS U.K. decreased $9.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily as a result of the discontinuation of equity method accounting subsequent to our acquisition of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. Equity in earnings of IFDS U.K. decreased $12.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, primarily attributable to lower revenues recognized related to client conversion activities and higher operating costs as IFDS U.K. expanded its infrastructure to address increasing regulatory, compliance and security needs.\nEquity in earnings of IFDS L.P. increased $16.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016, primarily as a result of $10.2 million of realized gains on the step-up of certain investments and real estate assets that were distributed from the joint venture to DST and State Street immediately prior to the acquisitions by DST of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. and BFDS. Equity in earnings of IFDS L.P. decreased $5.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015.\nEquity in earnings of BFDS decreased $4.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily as a result of the discontinuation of equity method accounting subsequent to the acquisition of the remaining interests in BFDS in March 2017. Equity in earnings of BFDS increased $3.0 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to higher ancillary and non-operating revenues as well as a reduction in operating costs.\nOur equity in earnings of other unconsolidated affiliates was $31.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $24.9 million as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $23.0 million increase resulting from a gain on the step-up of real estate distributed from Broadway Square Partners, LLP ( Broadway Square Partners\u201d), an unconsolidated affiliate, during 2017. Our equity in earnings of other unconsolidated affiliates was $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $3.5 million as compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $3.6 million gain resulting from the sale of real estate by an unconsolidated affiliate during 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2017, approximately $40.8 million of our consolidated retained earnings represents undistributed earnings in our unconsolidated affiliates accounted for by the equity method of accounting.\nIncome taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 15.8%, 36.2% and 32.5% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our income tax rate for 2017 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% primarily due to the non-taxable nature of the BFDS exchange transaction, the impacts of the Tax Act, the adoption of new accounting guidance issued for tax benefits on employee share-based compensation transactions, benefits realized from the settlement of uncertain tax positions, and a change in the proportional mix of domestic and international transactions. The 2017 impact of the Tax Act was a $13.7 million tax benefit, primarily from the net impact of the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities utilizing the enacted tax rate at the time they are anticipated to be realized less the estimated tax associated with the deemed mandatory repatriation of undistributed accumulated foreign earnings. This reflects our current estimate of the U.S. income tax effects of the Tax Act, however these are provisional amounts subject to adjustment during the one year measurement period provided pursuant to guidance in SAB 118.\nOur effective income tax rate for 2016 was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% primarily attributable to state income taxes, transaction related taxes, and a change in the proportional mix of domestic and international income, partially offset by federal income tax credits for foreign income taxes and research and development costs.\nOur effective income tax rate for 2015 was favorably impacted by an $11.9 million benefit from the completion of the IRS examination of previously filed federal income tax refund claims for Domestic Manufacturing Deductions, research and experimentation credits and capital losses for 2010 as well as other remeasurements during the period.\nExcluding the effect of discrete period items, we currently expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 26.5% in 2018. The 2018 tax rate can be affected as a result of variances among the estimates and amounts of 2018 sources of taxable income (e.g., domestic consolidated, joint venture and/or international), the realization of tax credits, adjustments which may arise from the resolution of tax matters under review, our assessment of our liability for uncertain tax positions, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, federal tax regulations and guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Act.\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax decreased $243.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased $199.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the sale of our North American Customer Communications business in July 2016, partially offset by the sale of our U.K. Customer Communications business in May 2017. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to the $234.7 million gain, net of tax, on the sale of our North American Customer Communications business partially offset by $17.0 million of goodwill and asset impairments in our U.K. Customer Communications business.\nYEAR TO YEAR BUSINESS SEGMENT COMPARISONS\nDOMESTIC FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\nThe following table presents the financial results of the Domestic Financial Services segment (in millions):\n\nThe following table summarizes the Domestic Financial Services segment's statistical metrics (in millions, except as noted):\n\n\nComparison of 2017 versus 2016 results\nOperating revenues\nDomestic Financial Services segment operating revenues of $1,187.2 million reflect an increase of $191.4 million or 19.2% in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the remaining interest in BFDS, which contributed $176.6 million of incremental operating revenues. Excluding the BFDS operating revenues in 2017, operating revenues for the Domestic Financial Services segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $14.8 million or 1.5%. This increase in operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 was partially due to a $5.0 million increase in revenue at ALPS resulting from an insurance claim reimbursement of $2.0 million received in fourth quarter 2017 as compared to a reduction to ALPS revenue of $3.0 million during 2016 for the processing error that generated the insurance claim. In addition, operating revenues were higher as a result of increased fund flows and higher market performance at ALPS, partially offset by decreased revenues resulting from the exit of certain product offerings and lower subaccounting and mutual fund registered shareowner account processing revenues. Additionally, software license revenues were $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $3.9 million as compared to 2016.\nCosts and expenses\nDomestic Financial Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1,072.2 million, an increase of $243.2 million as compared to 2016. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $111.8 million in 2017, an increase of $38.8 million as compared to 2016.\nExcluding reimbursable operating expenses, Domestic Financial Services costs and expenses increased $204.4 million or 27.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to $176.3 million of incremental costs and expenses from the consolidation of BFDS following the acquisition of the remaining interest in that entity in 2017 and higher share-based compensation expense which increased $25.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year.\nIn addition, costs and expenses increased from higher integration and restructuring costs related to our BFDS acquisition and higher information technology transformation spend partially offset by the non-recurrence of a software impairment recorded in 2016. We recorded restructuring charges of $16.3 million and $10.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we also recognized $11.6 million of expense related to a charitable contribution of our remaining State Street stock.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDomestic Financial Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $86.8 million, an increase of $9.5 million or 12.3% as compared to 2016. The increase in 2017 was primarily attributable to incremental amortization associated with acquired intangibles from the recent acquisitions as well as increased depreciation from capitalized costs incurred to enhance our network infrastructure, security and regulatory compliance.\nOperating income\nDomestic Financial Services segment operating income for 2017 was $140.0 million, a decrease of $22.5 million or 13.8% as compared to 2016. The decrease in Domestic Financial Services operating income was primarily due to higher share-based compensation expense, higher advisory and restructuring costs due to the integration activities for the recently acquired BFDS business and increased depreciation and amortization expense. Operating income also decreased due to an increase in information technology transformation spend, partially offset by higher revenues.\nComparison of 2016 versus 2015 results\nOperating revenues\nDomestic Financial Services segment operating revenues of $995.8 million increased $12.7 million or 1.3% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven from businesses acquired during 2015 and 2016, which contributed $31.8 million of incremental operating revenues. During 2016, we also completed the conversion of approximately 10.0 million subaccounts associated with a previously announced new client, which resulted in incremental revenues. These increases were partly offset by a decline in mutual fund registered shareowner account processing revenue due to lower registered accounts, primarily as a result of subaccounting conversions, and lower revenue due to extending certain long-term contracts with lower pricing. Additionally, software license revenues were $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.9 million as compared to 2015.\nCosts and expenses\nDomestic Financial Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $829.0 million, an increase of $36.7 million as compared to 2015. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $73.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $12.3 million as compared to 2015.\nExcluding reimbursable operating expenses, Domestic Financial Services costs and expenses increased $24.4 million or 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses during 2016 was primarily from acquisitions completed during 2015 and 2016, which included approximately $33.7 million of incremental expenses. Also, contributing to the increase in costs and expenses were the restructuring activities, which resulted in $10.4 million of employee and lease termination costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 to enhance operational efficiency within the Domestic Financial Services segment. We also incurred increased costs to enhance the network infrastructure utilized across all of our operating businesses and incremental costs to service new and existing clients. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also recognized a $6.0 million software impairment. These costs and expenses were partially offset by the reversal of accrued performance-related share-based compensation expense as 2015 PSUs were not expected to achieve the required performance criteria required for vesting and further savings realized from cost containment initiatives.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDomestic Financial Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $77.3 million, an increase of $9.6 million or 14.2% as compared to 2015. The increase in 2016 was primarily attributable to incremental amortization associated with acquired intangibles from the acquisitions completed in 2015 and 2016 as well as increased depreciation from capitalized costs incurred to enhance our network infrastructure and increase security and regulatory compliance. The increase in 2016 was also attributable to the acceleration of depreciation on certain capitalized software during 2016.\nOperating income\nDomestic Financial Services segment operating income for 2016 was $162.5 million, a decrease of $21.3 million or 11.6% as compared to 2015. The decrease in Domestic Financial Services operating income was primarily due to restructuring costs incurred during 2016, a software impairment charge, and increased costs incurred to enhance our network infrastructure, maintain security and regulatory compliance. These decreases were partially offset by the reversal of accrued performance-related share-based compensation expense, higher operating revenues and cost containment efforts during 2016.\nINTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\nThe following table presents the financial results of the International Financial Services segment (in millions):\n\nThe following table summarizes the International Financial Services segment's statistical metrics (in millions, except as noted):\n\nComparison of 2017 versus 2016 results\nOperating revenues\nInternational Financial Services segment operating revenues of $538.4 million reflect an increase of $427.5 million or 385.5% in 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily driven by the acquisition of the remaining interest in IFDS U.K., which contributed $425.2 million of incremental operating revenues, including the financial impacts resulting from the termination of a wealth management client agreement. The termination agreement resulted in incremental operating revenues of $93.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as DST accelerated recognition of previously deferred revenue and recognized termination payments received. Additionally, software license revenues were $12.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.6 million as compared to 2016. These increases were partly offset by lower revenues as a result of the previously discussed client termination in mid-2017 as well as the sale of DST Billing Solutions during 2016.\nCosts and expenses\nInternational Financial Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $449.3 million, an increase of $351.1 million as compared to 2016. Costs and expenses in the International Financial Services segment are primarily comprised of compensation and benefit costs as well as technology-related expenditures. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $12.2 million in 2017, an increase of $11.0 million as compared to 2016.\nExcluding reimbursable operating expenses, International Financial Services costs and expenses increased $340.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. Additionally, in connection with the termination agreement described above, we incurred bad debt expense of $34.5 million for previously invoiced services performed prior to the termination and $5.2 million of other termination-related charges.\nDepreciation and amortization\nInternational Financial Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $30.7 million, an increase of $27.6 million as compared to 2016. The increase in 2017 was primarily attributable to incremental amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of fixed assets from the acquisition of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K.\nOperating income\nInternational Financial Services segment operating income for 2017 was $70.6 million, an increase of $59.8 million or 553.7% as compared to 2016. The increase in International Financial Services operating income was primarily due to the impact of the termination of the wealth management client agreement of $53.5 million, including the recognition of previously deferred revenue and termination payments received as described above. The increase in operating income was also due to the higher revenues resulting from the acquisition of the remaining interest in IFDS U.K., partially offset by higher costs and expenses due to on-going development and implementation efforts for wealth management platform clients, share-based compensation expense, and restructuring charges.\nComparison of 2016 versus 2015 results\nOperating revenues\nInternational Financial Services segment operating revenues of $110.9 million increased $17.5 million or 18.7% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in operating revenues during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the increased professional services revenues associated with our international wealth management platform business. Software license revenues were $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.1 million as compared to 2015.\nCosts and expenses\nInternational Financial Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $98.2 million, an increase of $12.1 million as compared to 2015. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.5 million as compared to 2015.\nExcluding reimbursable operating expenses, International Financial Services costs and expenses increased $12.6 million or 14.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015. On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses during 2016 was primarily from higher staffing costs to support the increase in professional services revenues.\nDepreciation and amortization\nInternational Financial Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $3.1 million, a decrease of $1.7 million or 35.4% as compared to 2015. The decrease in 2016 was primarily attributable to lower depreciation from lower capital expenditures.\nOperating income\nInternational Financial Services segment operating income for 2016 was $10.8 million, an increase of $6.6 million or 157.1% as compared to 2015. The increase in International Financial Services operating income was primarily due to the increased professional services revenues associated with our international wealth management platform business.\nHEALTHCARE SERVICES SEGMENT\nThe following table presents the financial results of the Healthcare Services segment (in millions):\n\nThe following tables summarize the Healthcare Services segment's statistical metrics (in millions):\n\n\nComparison of 2017 versus 2016 results\nOperating revenues\nHealthcare Services segment operating revenues of $418.5 million decreased $7.7 million or 1.8% in 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease in operating revenue during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to the previously announced client transitions off of our systems, which resulted in approximately $46.5 million of lower revenues. Excluding client migrations, Healthcare Services operating revenues increased by $38.8 million or 10.2%. On this basis, the increase in operating revenues primarily resulted from organic growth and the expansion of the high-value services that we are offering to existing clients in both the medical and pharmacy businesses. These increases were partially offset by reductions in membership related to exchanges and lower consulting and development revenues which we believe is the result of a decline in healthcare technology spending due to the ongoing uncertainty around government policy changes. Additionally, operating revenues included approximately $9.8 million of software license fee revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.8 million as compared to 2016.\nCosts and expenses\nHealthcare Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $340.9 million, a decrease of $4.2 million as compared to 2016. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $7.5 million in 2017, a decrease of $1.0 million as compared to 2016. Excluding reimbursable operating expenses, costs and expenses were $333.4 million for 2017, a decrease of $3.2 million as compared to 2016. On this basis, the decrease in costs and expenses during 2017 was primarily due to lower staffing needs resulting from the previously announced client migrations, partially offset by increased restructuring charges and increased share-based compensation expense. We recorded $4.4 million of restructing charges in 2017, as compared to none in 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization\nHealthcare Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $10.5 million, a decrease of $5.1 million or 32.7% as compared to 2016. The decrease is attributable to lower capital expenditures and an intangible asset becoming fully amortized during 2017.\nOperating income\nHealthcare Services segment operating income for 2017 was $74.6 million, an increase of $0.6 million or 0.8% as compared to 2016. The slight increase in operating income was primarily attributable to organic growth and the expansion of the high-value services that we are offering to existing clients in both the medical and pharmacy businesses and decreases in depreciation and amortization. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact of client migrations, restructuring charges, and increased share-based compensation expenses.\nComparison of 2016 versus 2015 results\nOperating revenues\nHealthcare Services segment operating revenues of $426.2 million increased $49.8 million or 13.2% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increase in operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily from new medical claims processing clients implemented during 2016, organic growth and the expansion of high-value services we are offering to existing clients in both the medical and pharmacy businesses. Operating revenues included approximately $8.0 million of software license fee revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.1 million as compared to 2015.\nCosts and expenses\nHealthcare Services segment costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $345.1 million, an increase of $23.8 million as compared to 2015. Reimbursable operating expenses included in costs and expenses were $8.5 million in 2016, an increase of $0.3 million as compared to 2015. Excluding reimbursable operating expenses, costs and expenses were $336.6 million for 2016, an increase of $23.5 million as compared to 2015. On this basis, the increase in costs and expenses during 2016 was primarily attributable to increased staffing costs incurred to support the higher medical transaction volumes due to the growth in BPO services. These costs and expenses were partially offset by restructuring costs that occurred during 2015 that did not recur during 2016 and a $2.4 million reduction of share-based compensation expense as certain PSUs were no longer expected to vest.\nDepreciation and amortization\nHealthcare Services segment depreciation and amortization costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $15.6 million, a decrease of $3.0 million or 16.1% as compared to 2015 primarily due to lower capital expenditures.\nOperating income\nHealthcare Services segment operating income for 2016 was $74.0 million, an increase of $29.3 million or 65.5% as compared to 2015. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to higher revenues from organic growth and new medical claims processing clients implemented in 2016, resulting in enhanced economies of scale as clients were converted as well as a reduction of share-based compensation expense as certain PSUs were no longer expected to vest. These increases were partially offset by increased staffing costs incurred to support the higher medical transaction volumes due to the growth in BPO services.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCompany's Assessment of Short-term and Long-term Liquidity\nWe believe that our existing cash balances and other current assets, together with cash provided by operating activities and, as necessary, our revolving credit facilities, are sufficient to meet our operating and debt service requirements and other current liabilities for at least the next 12 months. Further, we believe that our longer term liquidity and capital requirements will also be met through cash provided by operating activities, bank credit facilities and other investments.\nAt December 31, 2017, total cash and cash equivalents were $80.5 million, of which $46.0 million was held outside of the U.S. Although the amounts held outside the U.S. have been taxed through the Transition Tax, these amounts could be subject to other taxes such as withholding taxes and local taxes. We have accrued for withholding taxes and local taxes on the earnings of our international subsidiaries except when the earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. The repatriation of these earnings could result in additional withholding and local tax payments in future years. We utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had approximately $990.7 million of availability under our domestic revolving credit facilities, including our accounts receivable securitization program. Debt obligations, classified as long-term when originally issued, existing as of December 31, 2017 that are scheduled to mature in 2018 include $65.0 million of Series C 2010 Senior Notes that are scheduled to mature in August 2018 and $3.7 million of payments related to outstanding mortgages. We are scheduled\nto issue $65.0 million of Series C 2017 Senior Notes in August 2018 which are expected to be utilized to repay the Series C 2010 Senior Notes.\nWe may need to access debt and equity markets in the future if unforeseen costs or opportunities arise, to fund acquisitions or investments or to repay indebtedness. If we need to obtain new debt or equity financing in the future, the terms and availability of such financing may be impacted by economic and financial market conditions as well as our financial condition and results of operations at the time we seek additional financing. We currently have $585.0 million of additional capacity pursuant to the master note purchase agreement dated November 14, 2017 that could be utilized for future debt issuances.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe had $80.5 million, $195.5 million and $79.5 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our primary source of liquidity has historically been cash provided by operations. In addition, we have used proceeds from the sale of investments to fund other investing and financing activities. Principal uses of cash are operations, reinvestment in our proprietary technologies, capital expenditures, investment purchases, business acquisitions, payments on debt, stock repurchases and dividend payments. Additionally, we expect to incur significant transaction costs associated with the completion of the Merger. Information on our consolidated cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 is presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, categorized by operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.\nThe sale of our North American Customer Communications business on July 1, 2016 and our U.K. Customer Communications business on May 4, 2017 resulted in cash consideration of approximately $410.7 million and $43.6 million, respectively, net of tax. The after-tax proceeds from the sales were used in accordance with the Company's capital plan, including investments in the business, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions, debt repayments and other corporate purposes.\nOperating Activities\nCash flows provided from continuing operating activities were $164.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Operating cash flows from continuing operating activities during 2017 resulted principally from income from continuing operations of $447.6 million, adjusted for non-cash or non-operating items of $108.2 million including depreciation and amortization, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, net gains on investments and gains recognized on the step up of the carrying value of our previously held equity interests in unconsolidated affiliates as a result of the acquisitions of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K., and a use of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $175.4 million. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities include a $127.9 million use of cash related to other assets primarily due to up-front payments made to clients which are expected to be recovered over the clients' contractual arrangements and higher prepaid software costs, a $39.9 million use of cash for accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and a $29.6 million use of cash related to deferred revenue and gains primarily as a result of the wealth management platform client termination.\nCash flows provided from continuing operating activities were $162.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating cash flows from continuing operations during 2016 resulted principally from income from continuing operations of $178.1 million, adjusted for non-cash or non-operating items of $90.4 million including depreciation and amortization and equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates, and a use of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $105.8 million. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities include a $26.9 million use of cash related to accrued compensation and benefits, a $16.6 million source of cash resulting from accounts payable and accrued liabilities, a $16.0 million use of cash related to accounts receivable, and a $67.9 million use of cash related to timing of income tax payments.\nCash flows provided from continuing operating activities were $135.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Operating cash flows from continuing operating activities during 2015 resulted principally from income from continuing operations of $309.6 million, adjusted for non-cash or non-operating items of $110.3 million including depreciation and amortization, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and net gains on investments, and a use of cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities of $63.6 million. Significant changes in operating assets and liabilities include a $10.6 million use of cash related to accounts receivable, and a $31.6 million use of cash related to timing of income tax payments.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in continuing investing activities were $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Sources of our cash inflows were net investment activities (proceeds from investment sales, net of investments in securities) of $39.8 million, fluctuations in funds held on behalf of clients of $43.3 million and distributions received from unconsolidated affiliates of $32.7 million, primarily from IFDS L.P in connection with the acquisition of the remaining interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K., offset by cash used to acquire IFDS U.K. (net of cash acquired) of $38.9 million and capital expenditures of $78.8 million.\nCash flows used in continuing investing activities during 2016 of $117.3 million were primarily attributable to net investment activities (proceeds from investment sales, net of investments in securities) of $59.5 million, offset by cash used to acquire KRFS of $93.5 million, capital expenditures of $60.4 million, fluctuations in funds held on behalf of clients of $20.3 million, as well as approximately $28.0 million of cash loaned to IFDS U.K. during 2016.\nCash flows used in continuing investing activities were $102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily attributable to net investment activities (proceeds from investment sales, net of investments in securities) of $192.2 million, which includes $176.1 million of pretax proceeds from the sale of State Street stock. These sources of cash were offset by $117.4 million of cash used to acquire kasina LLC, Red Rocks Capital LLC and Wealth Management Systems, Inc. during 2015, $88.9 million used to purchase capital assets, as well as $113.5 million due to fluctuations in funds held on behalf of clients.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe following table summarizes capital expenditures by segment (in millions):\n\nDuring 2017, 2016 and 2015, we capitalized software development costs of $24.1 million, $21.5 million and $23.3 million, respectively, which are included within the capital expenditures listed above. Capital expenditures using debt are treated as non-cash transactions and are not included in the annual capital expenditure amounts above.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows used in continuing financing activities totaled $317.4 million, $374.8 million and $278.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCommon Stock Issuances and Repurchases\nWe received cash proceeds of $2.8 million, $5.3 million and $11.8 million from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of employee stock options during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The value of shares received in exchange for satisfaction of the exercise price and for tax-withholding obligations arising from the exercise of options to purchase our stock or from the vesting of restricted shares are included in Common stock repurchased in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $150.0 million of capacity remaining under our share repurchase plan authorized in 2016. On May 9, 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a new $300.0 million share repurchase plan, which allows, but does not require, the repurchase of common stock in open market and private transactions. We repurchased the equivalent of 5.0 million shares of our common stock on a post stock split basis for $300.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, which left approximately $150.0 million remaining under our share repurchase plan authorized in 2017. The 2017 share repurchase plan does not have an expiration date, however we are currently precluded from executing additional stock repurchases pursuant to the Merger Agreement with SS&C. Under previous share repurchase plans, we expended $300.0 million for approximately 5.4 million shares on a post stock split basis and $400.0 million for approximately 7.2 million shares on a post stock split basis during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDividends\nWe paid cash dividends of $0.72, $0.66 and $0.60 per common share in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The total cash paid for dividends in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $43.7 million, $43.4 million and $43.1 million, respectively. We are currently precluded from declaring dividends pursuant to the Merger Agreement with SS&C.\nClient Funds Obligations\nClient funds obligations represent our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client pharmacy claim obligations and are recorded on the balance sheet when incurred, generally after a claim has been processed by us. In addition, client funds obligations include transfer agency client balances invested overnight. Our contractual obligations to remit funds to satisfy client obligations are primarily sourced by funds held on behalf of clients. We had $504.2 million, $564.6 million and $533.4 million of client funds obligations at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDebt Activity\nDuring 2017, we had the following primary sources of debt financing: our syndicated revolving credit facility; accounts receivable securitization program; and privately placed senior notes (the 2010 Senior Notes\u201d and 2017 Senior Notes\u201d). We had $620.8 million, $508.2 million and $562.1 million of debt outstanding at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $112.6 million during 2017 and a decrease of $53.9 million during 2016.\nThe increase in debt outstanding during 2017 resulted primarily from issuing $350.0 million of 2017 Senior Notes in November 2017, the assumption of a mortgage as a result of the acquisition of the remaining interests in IFDS U.K. and the assumption of a mortgage associated with a real estate distribution from Broadway Square Partners, partially offset by a reduction in amounts outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization program and revolving credit facilities. Proceeds from the 2017 Senior Notes were primarily used to pay down our revolving credit facilities. The decrease in debt outstanding during 2016 resulted primarily from the utilization of the proceeds from the sale of our North American Customer Communications business to pay down outstanding balances, partially offset by borrowings to fund the KRFS business acquisition, share repurchases and working capital uses.\nOur debt agreements contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on consolidated indebtedness, liens, investments, subsidiary indebtedness, asset dispositions and require certain consolidated leverage and interest coverage ratios to be maintained. We are currently in compliance with these covenants. A default under certain of our borrowings could trigger defaults under certain of our other debt obligations, which in turn could result in their maturities being accelerated. Our debt arrangements are further described in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10, Debt.\u201d\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017 (in millions):\n\nInterest obligations on our outstanding debt are not included in the table above. The syndicated revolving credit facility contains grid schedules that adjust borrowing costs up or down based upon our consolidated leverage ratio. The grid schedules may result in fluctuations in borrowing costs ranging from 1.00% to 1.70% over Eurodollar and 0.00% to 0.70% over base rate, as defined. The 2010 Senior Notes outstanding have fixed interest rates and are comprised of $65.0 million of 5.06% Series C Senior Notes and $160.0 million of 5.42% Series D Senior Notes. The $350.0 million of 2017 Senior Notes outstanding have an average fixed interest rate of approximately 4.0%. In addition to the financial instruments listed above, the program fees incurred on proceeds from the sale of receivables under our accounts receivable securitization program are determined based on variable interest rates associated with LIBOR plus an applicable margin.\nWe have liabilities for income tax uncertainties of $67.7 million at December 31, 2017. These obligations are classified as non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as resolution of these matters is expected to take more than a year; however, the ultimate timing of resolution is uncertain. As we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when payments may occur for our unrecognized tax benefits, our liability for income tax uncertainties is not included in the table above.\nDue to the enactment of the Tax Act, we recorded a provisional income tax payable related to the Transition Tax of $8.4 million, of which $7.3 million is reported as noncurrent as it is not expected to be paid within one year. As permitted by the Tax Act, the Transition Tax will be paid over an eight-year period, beginning in 2018, and will not accrue interest. This\nprovisional amount, as well as the current estimated timing of payments, is subject to change based on additional guidance from and interpretations by U.S. regulatory and standard-setting bodies and changes in assumptions.\nOther Commercial Commitments\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products and other business assets, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. At December 31, 2017, except for certain immaterial items, there were no liabilities for guarantees or indemnifications as it is not possible to determine either the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements or the timing of any such payments due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made under these agreements have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSS&C Merger Agreement\nUnder certain circumstances, we would be required to pay a termination fee of $165.0 million to SS&C in the event the Merger Agreement with SS&C is terminated.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAn off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with the company.\nWe believe that our guarantee arrangements will not have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, capital expenditures, capital resources, liquidity or results of operations. These arrangements are described above and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d", "item_7_tables": "Table 42: <table><tr><td> </td>

"summary": "The provided text is a comprehensive financial report discussing various aspects of a company's financial performance and condition. Here is a summary of key points:\n\n1. Forward-Looking Statements: The report contains statements about expected future business performance and financial conditions, subject to uncertainties and risks, such as market competition, changes in client demand, legal and regulatory issues, data breaches, and the impacts of natural disasters and terrorism.\n\n2. Risks and Uncertainties: Specific risks that could materially affect actual results include changes in competition, client demands, economic conditions, cybersecurity, legal compliance, regulatory proceedings, investment performance, business acquisitions, and a potential merger with SS&C.\n\n3. Business and Strategic Developments: The company uses proprietary software to provide data management and business solutions globally. It has embarked on an IT transformation effort, which will temporarily increase expenses. DST Systems, Inc. has agreed to be acquired by SS&C, subject to approvals and conditions.\n\n4. Financial Results: Total revenues and costs have increased significantly, partially due to acquisitions like State Street's interests in BFDS and IFDS U.K.\n\n5. Segment Performance: \n   - Domestic Financial Services provides services related to investor transactions and assets for U.S. financial services, contributing to an increase in operating revenues.\n   - International Financial Services serves global markets, also showing increased revenues from acquisitions.\n   - Healthcare Services provides benefit solutions for health organizations; this segment had slightly decreased revenue due to client transitions.\n\n6. Liquidity and Capital Resources: The company's cash and borrowing facilities are believed to be sufficient for the next 12 months. Key uses of cash include operations, reinvesting in technology, acquisitions, debt repayment, and shareholder returns.\n\n7. Cash Flow Statements: Cash provided by operations serves as the primary liquidity source. Investing activities involve acquiring businesses and capital expenditures, while financing activities include issuing debt and repurchasing stock.\n\n8. Debt and Obligations: The company has outlined its obligations, including debt repayments, lease agreements, software licenses, and other commitments.\n\n9. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: The report also notes guarantees and other off-balance sheet arrangements that are not expected to materially impact the company\u2019s financial condition. \n\n10. SS&C Merger: Under certain conditions, DST Systems may need to pay a termination fee of $165 million for the merger agreement with SS&C.\n\nThe information presented in the report is based on estimates and assumptions and actual results could differ materially. The report also provides the company\u2019s critical accounting policies and describes how revenue is recognized, software development costs are capitalized and amortized, and how investments and income taxes are accounted for. Furthermore, the document includes a detailed discussion of the company\u2019s management of cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as well as their impact on the company's liquidity and capital resources."}
