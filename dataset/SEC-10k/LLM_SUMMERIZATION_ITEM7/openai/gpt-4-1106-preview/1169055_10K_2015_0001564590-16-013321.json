The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed by Noble-UK and Noble-Cayman.\nThe results of operations for Paragon Offshore prior to August 1, 2014, the Spin-off date, and non-recurring costs related to the Spin-off have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report. The terms earnings\u201d and loss\u201d as used in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d refer to income/(loss) from continuing operations. Income/(loss) from continuing operations is representative of the Company's current business operations and focus.\nExecutive Overview\nOur 2015 financial and operating results from continuing operations include:\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> operating revenues totaling $3.4 billion;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> net income of $511 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, which includes a $418 million after-tax impairment charge recognized on two of our rigs, certain capital spare equipment and certain corporate assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> net cash from operating activities totaling $1.8 billion; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> a decrease in debt to 38 percent of total capitalization at the end of 2015, down from 40 percent at the end of 2014 as a result of the repayment of certain maturing notes during the current year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe business environment for offshore drillers during 2015 remained challenging. The rig capacity imbalance, caused in part by the addition of newbuild units and rigs completing current contracts, increased while customer demand for these rigs has decreased. Beginning in June 2014, the price of oil, a key factor in determining customer activity levels, began to decline rapidly, with the Brent crude price declining from approximately $112 per barrel on June 30, 2014 to approximately $37 per barrel on December 31, 2015. In this environment, operators have curtailed drilling programs, especially exploration activity, resulting in a dramatic reduction in dayrates for new contracts, as well as lower rig utilization. While there have been a number of rig retirements in 2015 and early 2016, the rig capacity imbalance has not corrected.\nWe expect that the business environment for 2016 will remain challenging and could potentially deteriorate further. The present level of global economic activity, the potential increase of oil supply from Iran and a lack of production cuts within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are contributing to an uncertain oil price environment, leading to a persistent disruption in our customers' exploration and production spending plans. Capital expenditures undertaken by the offshore drilling industry in recent years have increased the supply of drilling rigs and current and expected demand from customers during 2016 is not expected to support this current supply. We cannot give any assurances as to when these conditions in the offshore drilling market will improve, or when there will be higher demand for contract drilling services or a decline in the supply of available drilling rigs. While current market conditions persist, we will continue to focus on operating efficiency, cost control and operating margin preservation, which could include the stacking or retirement of additional drilling rigs.\nWe believe in the long-term fundamentals for the industry, especially for those contractors with a modern fleet of high-specification rigs like ours. Also, we believe the ultimate market recovery will benefit from any sustained under-investment by customers during this current market phase.\nOur business strategy focuses on deepwater drilling and high-specification jackups and the deployment of our drilling rigs in important oil and gas basins around the world.\nWe have expanded our offshore deepwater drilling and high-specification jackup capabilities through the construction of rigs. Currently, we have one newbuild project remaining, the heavy-duty, harsh environment jackup, Noble Lloyd Noble, which is scheduled to commence operations under a four-year contract in the North Sea during the third quarter of 2016. Although we plan to focus on capital preservation and liquidity because of current market conditions, we also plan to continue to evaluate opportunities as they arise from time to time to enhance our fleet, particularly focusing on higher specification rigs, to execute the increasingly more complex drilling programs required by our customers.\nWhile we cannot predict the future level of demand or dayrates for our services, or future conditions in the offshore contract drilling industry, we believe we are strategically well positioned.\nImpairment\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, in connection with our annual impairment analysis, we decided that we would no longer market one of our drillships, the Noble Discoverer. The decision was a result of the termination of the contract for this rig by Shell in December 2015 and the decreased opportunities for rigs of this type in the current marketplace. We also reviewed assumptions on the future marketability of one of our jackups, the Noble Charles Copeland, after its contract completion in late September 2015, with consideration given to its years in service, limited technical features and anticipated capital requirements in light of the current market conditions. As a result of this analysis, we have decided to discontinue marketing this unit. Additionally, as a result of a fourth quarter review of capital spare equipment, we elected to retire certain capital spare equipment. As a result of our analysis discussed above, we recorded an impairment charge of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAlso in 2015, we determined that certain corporate assets were partially impaired due to a declining market for, and the potential disposal of, the assets. We estimated the fair value of the assets based on quotes from brokers of similar assets (Level 2). Based on these estimates, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we decided to discontinue marketing three of our semisubmersibles, the Noble Driller, the Noble Jim Thompson and the Noble Paul Wolff, as a result of the market conditions. We evaluated these units for impairments and recorded an impairment charge of $685 million on these units. Additionally, we fully impaired the $60 million of goodwill on our books, which originated from the acquisition of FDR Holdings Limited ( Frontier\u201d) in 2010, as a result of a significant decline in the market value of our stock, a decrease in oil and gas prices, significant reductions in the projected dayrates for new contracts and reduced utilization forecasts.\nWe evaluate the impairment of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, on an annual basis, we complete an impairment analysis on our rig fleet. An impairment loss on our property and equipment exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset's carrying value over the estimated fair value. As part of this analysis, we make assumptions and estimates regarding future market conditions. To the extent actual results do not meet our estimated assumptions, for a given rig class, we may take an impairment loss in the future.\nSpin-off of Paragon Offshore plc\nOn August 1, 2014, Noble-UK completed the separation and spin-off of a majority of its standard specification offshore drilling business through a pro rata distribution of all of the ordinary shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Paragon Offshore, to the holders of Noble's ordinary shares. Our shareholders received one share of Paragon Offshore for every three shares of Noble owned as of July 23, 2014, the record date for the distribution. Through the Spin-off, we disposed of most of our standard specification drilling units and related assets, liabilities and business. Prior to the Spin-off, Paragon Offshore issued approximately $1.7 billion of long-term debt. We used the proceeds from this debt to repay certain amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. The results of operations for Paragon Offshore prior to the Spin-off date and incremental Spin-off related costs have been classified as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. There were no discontinued operations in 2015.\nIn February 2016, we entered into an agreement in principle for a settlement with Paragon Offshore under which, in exchange for a full and unconditional release of any claims by Paragon Offshore in connection with the Spin-off (including certain claims that could be brought on behalf of Paragon Offshore's creditors), we agreed to assume the administration of Mexican tax claims for specified years up to and including 2010, as well as the related bonding obligations and certain of the related tax liabilities. The agreement is subject to approval of the bankruptcy court following Paragon Offshore's filing of a pre-negotiated bankruptcy plan. For additional information regarding the Spin-off, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2-Spin-off of Paragon Offshore plc\u201d and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18-Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nPrior to the completion of the Spin-off, Noble and Paragon Offshore entered into a series of agreements to effect the separation and Spin-off and govern the relationship between the parties after the Spin-off.\nMaster Separation Agreement ( MSA\u201d)\nThe general terms and conditions relating to the separation and Spin-off are set forth in the MSA. The MSA identifies the assets transferred, liabilities assumed and contracts assigned either to Paragon Offshore by us or by Paragon Offshore to us in the separation and describes when and how these transfers, assumptions and assignments would occur. The MSA provides for, among other things, Paragon Offshore's responsibility for liabilities relating to its business and the responsibility of Noble for liabilities related to our, and in certain limited cases, Paragon Offshore's business, in each case irrespective of when the liability arose. The MSA also contains indemnification obligations and ongoing commitments by us and Paragon Offshore.\nEmployee Matters Agreement ( EMA\u201d)\nThe EMA allocates liabilities and responsibilities between us and Paragon Offshore relating to employment, compensation and benefits and other employment related matters.\nTax Sharing Agreement\nThe tax sharing agreement provides for the allocation of tax liabilities and benefits between us and Paragon Offshore and governs the parties' assistance with tax-related claims.\nTransition Services Agreements\nUnder two transition services agreements, we agreed to continue, for a limited period of time, to provide various interim support services to Paragon Offshore, and Paragon Offshore agreed to provide various interim support services to us, including providing operational and administrative support for our remaining Brazilian operations.\nContract Drilling Services Backlog\nWe maintain a backlog (as defined below) of commitments for contract drilling services. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2015, the amount of our contract drilling services backlog and the percent of available operating days committed for the periods indicated:\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract Drilling Services Backlog\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Semisubmersibles/Drillships (1)(3)(4)(6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Jackups\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percent of Available Days Committed (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Semisubmersibles/Drillships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Jackups\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The drilling contracts with Royal Dutch Shell plc ( Shell\u201d) for the Noble Globetrotter I, Noble Globetrotter II and Noble Don Taylor provide opportunities for us to earn performance bonuses based on key performance indicators as defined by the contracts.

Backlog for the remaining four contracts previously reflected the original, pre-adjustment contract rates. However, given current market conditions and based on discussions with the customer, we do not expect the rates to return to the original contract rates. Instead, we expect the contract rates to be in the general range of the amended rates for 2015 through the end of each respective contract, which would reduce the backlog for those rigs by approximately $253 million or potentially by a greater amount should negotiations lead to a lower dayrate. Backlog for these contracts has now been prepared assuming the reduced rates for 2015 apply for the remainder of the contract.\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> Three of our long-term contracts with Shell, the Noble Globetrotter I, Noble Globetrotter II and Noble Bully II, contain dayrate adjustment clauses after the initial five-year contract term.

These contracts commence indexing in April 2017, July 2017 and September 2018 for the Noble Bully II, Noble Globetrotter I and Noble Globetrotter II, respectively. There can be no assurance regarding the level of future dayrates under these market-indexed contracts. For every $50,000 change in dayrate under each of these contracts, backlog would be adjusted by $275 million in the aggregate. The backlog shown herein assumes the initial dayrate continues for the entirety of the contract because of the lack of relevant available market data. Should the current adverse market conditions persist into 2017, 2018 or beyond, we would expect a material reduction to dayrates as compared to the initial five-year term rate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> (4)\n</td> <td> The drilling contracts for the Noble Sam Croft and Noble Tom Madden remain under contract with Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

We are currently in discussion with Freeport regarding these contracts to determine whether there is a mutually beneficial arrangement that appropriately addresses the interests of each party.

Noble's proportional interest in the backlog for these rigs totals $632 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur contract drilling services backlog reflects estimated future revenues attributable to both signed drilling contracts and letters of intent that we expect to result in binding drilling contracts. A letter of intent is generally subject to customary conditions, including the execution of a definitive drilling contract. It is possible that some customers that have entered into letters of intent will not enter into signed drilling contracts. As of December 31, 2015, our contract drilling services backlog did not include any letters of intent.\nWe calculate backlog for any given unit and period by multiplying the full contractual operating dayrate for such unit by the number of days remaining in the period. The reported contract drilling services backlog does not include amounts representing revenues for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation, which are not expected to be significant to our contract drilling services revenues, amounts constituting reimbursables from customers or amounts attributable to uncommitted option periods under drilling contracts or letters of intent.\nThe amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned may be materially different than the backlog amounts and backlog periods set forth in the table above due to various factors, including, but not limited to, shipyard and maintenance projects, unplanned downtime, the operation of market benchmarks for dayrate resets, achievement of bonuses, weather conditions, reduced standby or mobilization rates and other factors that result in applicable dayrates lower than the full contractual operating dayrate. In addition, amounts included in the backlog may change because drilling contracts may be varied or modified by mutual consent or customers may exercise early termination rights contained in some of our drilling contracts or decline to enter into a drilling contract after executing a letter of intent. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual operating results for the periods for which the backlog is calculated. Please read Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors-We can provide no assurance that our current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized.\u201d\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2015 Compared to 2014\nGeneral\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to Noble-UK for 2015 was $511 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.4 billion, compared to net loss from continuing operations for 2014 of $152 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.2 billion.\nAs a result of Noble-UK conducting all of its business through Noble-Cayman and its subsidiaries, the financial position and results of operations for Noble-Cayman, and the reasons for material changes in the amount of revenue and expense items between 2015 and 2014, would be the same as the information presented below regarding Noble-UK in all material respects, except operating income for Noble-Cayman for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $29 million and $50 million higher, respectively, than operating income for Noble-UK for the same periods. The operating income difference is primarily a result of executive costs directly attributable to Noble-UK for operations support and stewardship related services. In addition, we had non-recurring costs of $63 million in 2014 related to the Spin-off, which we recognized as part of discontinued operations at the Noble-UK level.\nRig Utilization, Operating Days and Average Dayrates\nOperating results from continuing operations for our contract drilling services segment are dependent on three primary metrics: rig utilization, operating days and dayrates. The following table sets forth the average rig utilization, operating days and average dayrates for our rig fleet for 2015 and 2014:\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average Rig\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Utilization (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Days (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dayrates\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Jackups\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 177,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Semisubmersibles(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 445,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 409,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Drillships(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 547,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 482,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> **\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> **\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 358,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 339,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> We define utilization for a specific period as the total number of days our rigs are operating under contract, divided by the product of the total number of our rigs, including cold stacked rigs, and the number of calendar days in such period.

Changes in contract drilling services revenues for the current year as compared to the prior year were driven by a 6 percent increase in average dayrates, partially offset by a 2 percent decrease in operating days. The 6 percent increase in average dayrates increased revenues by approximately $175 million, while the 2 percent decrease in operating days decreased revenues by $61 million.\nThe increase in contract drilling services revenues relates to our drillships which generated approximately $453 million more revenue in 2015. This amount was offset by decreases in revenues for our semisubmersibles and jackups, which declined by $330 million and $9 million, respectively, from the prior year.\nDuring the current year, we recognized $145 million of dayrate revenues related to the Noble Discoverer cancellation agreement with Shell. Excluding the cancellation agreement, drillship revenues increased by $308 million driven by an 18 percent increase in operating days and a 4 percent increase in average dayrates, resulting in a $242 million and a $66 million increase in revenues, respectively, from the prior year. The increase in both average dayrates and operating days was the result of a full year of operations from the Noble Sam Croft and the Noble Tom Madden, which commenced operations in July 2014 and November 2014, respectively.\nDuring the current year, we recognized $137 million of dayrate revenues related to the Noble Homer Ferrington arbitration award. Excluding the arbitration award, semisubmersible revenues decreased by $467 million driven by a 34 percent decline in operating days and a 9 percent decline in average dayrates, resulting in a $397 million and a $70 million decline in revenues, respectively, from the prior year. The decrease in both operating days and average dayrates was primarily attributable to the retirement of the Noble Jim Thompson, the Noble Driller and the Noble Paul Wolff as a result of our decision to retire these rigs based on the declining market conditions. Additionally, the Noble Max Smith was operational during the prior year but was off contract during the current year and the Noble Paul Romano was operational during the prior year but was off contract for a significant portion of the current year. This was partially offset by the Noble Amos Runner, which operated during the current year but was in the shipyard undergoing regulatory inspections and maintenance during a portion of the prior year.\nThe decrease in jackup revenues was driven by an 8 percent decrease in average dayrates, which resulted in a $59 million decrease in revenues driven by unfavorable dayrate changes on contracts across the jackup fleet. This was partially offset by an 8 percent increase in operating days, which resulted in a $50 million increase in revenues from the prior year. The increase in operating days was the result of a full year of revenue from the Noble Houston Colbert and the Noble Sam Turner, which began operations in March 2014 and August 2014, respectively, coupled with the commencement of the Noble Tom Prosser during October 2015. Additionally, the Noble David Tinsley experienced full utilization in the current year but was off contract for a majority of the prior year. This was partially offset by the Noble Mick O'Brien, which was available during the current year but was under contract for a substantial portion of 2014.\nOperating Costs and Expenses. Contract drilling services operating costs and expenses decreased $268 million for the current year as compared to the prior year. This was due to decreased costs of $117 million related to the retirement of the Noble Jim Thompson, the Noble Driller and the Noble Paul Wolff and $83 million related to idle or stacked rigs. This was partially offset by crew-up and operating expenses for our newbuild rigs as they commenced, or prepared to commence, operating under contracts, which added approximately $118 million in expense in the current year. Excluding these factors, contract drilling services costs decreased by $186 million. This decrease was driven by a $41 million decrease in labor costs due to the termination of retention bonuses and decreases in certain non-contractual crew positions, a $40 million decrease in mobilization and transportation expenses related to certain rig moves during the prior year, a $32 million decrease in repair and maintenance costs, a $24 million decrease in operations support costs, a $16 million decrease in other rig-related expenses, an $11 million decrease in insurance costs related to our policy renewal in March 2015, a $12 million decrease in fuel and travel rotational expenses and a $10 million decrease for the reimbursement of costs and fees related to the Noble Homer Ferrington arbitration award during the current year that were previously recognized through contract drilling services operating costs and expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $3 million in 2015 over 2014, which is primarily attributable to newbuild rigs placed in service partially offset by the retirement of the three semisubmersible rigs discussed above.\nLoss on impairment during the current year of $406 million relates to the Noble Discoverer and the Noble Charles Copeland, which we elected to discontinue marketing due to current market conditions. Additionally, as a result of a fourth quarter review of capital spare equipment, we elected to retire certain capital spare equipment. Loss on impairment during the prior year of $745 million relates to a $685 million charge on three of our semisubmersibles, the Noble Driller, the Noble Jim Thompson and the Noble Paul Wolff, which we decided not to actively market as a result of the declining market conditions, and a $60 million impairment charge for goodwill that originated from the acquisition of Frontier in 2010.\nOther Income and Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses. Overall, general and administrative expenses decreased $30 million in 2015 from 2014, primarily as a result of decreased office and other expenses of $13 million, employee related costs of $10 million and legal and other professional fees of $7 million.\nInterest Expense, net of amount capitalized. Interest expense, net of amount capitalized, increased $59 million in 2015 from 2014. The increase is a result of the issuance of $1.1 billion of Senior Notes in March 2015, coupled with lower capitalized interest in the current year as compared to the prior year due primarily to the completion of construction on four of our newbuild jackups and two of our newbuild drillships. During the current year, we capitalized approximately 10 percent of total interest charges versus approximately 23 percent during the prior year.\nInterest Income and Other, Net. Interest income and other, net increased $38 million in the current year as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily the result of $30 million of interest income recognized in connection with the Noble Homer Ferrington arbitration award, coupled with $5 million of interest received on a U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) tax refund for the years 2006 and 2007 during the current year.\nIncome Tax Provision. Our income tax provision increased $53 million in the current year, of which $27 million related to the Noble Homer Ferrington arbitration award. Excluding the arbitration award, our income tax provision increased by $26 million. Excluding the impact of the impairment charges recognized in 2015 and 2014 and the Noble Discoverer contract cancellation payment in the fourth quarter of 2015, taxes decreased $7 million as a result of a lower worldwide effective tax rate, partially offset by higher pre-tax income. The 13 percent decrease in the worldwide effective tax rate during the current year generated a $19 million decrease to income tax expense, and was primarily a result of the geographic mix of pre-tax income, the effect of lower downtime and various discrete items. This was partially offset by a 9 percent increase in pre-tax earnings, which generated a $12 million increase in income tax expense.\nDiscontinued Operations. There was no activity related to discontinued operations during the current year. During the prior year, net income from discontinued operations was $161 million. In 2014, revenues reported within discontinued operations were $1.0 billion and operating income included within discontinued operations was $220 million.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nGeneral\nNet loss from continuing operations attributable to Noble-UK for 2014 was $152 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.2 billion, compared to net income from continuing operations for 2013 of $479 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $2.5 billion.\nAs a result of Noble-UK conducting all of its business through Noble-Cayman and its subsidiaries, the financial position and results of operations for Noble-Cayman, and the reasons for material changes in the amount of revenue and expense items between 2014 and 2013, would be the same as the information presented below regarding Noble-UK in all material respects, except operating income for Noble-Cayman for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $50 million and $65 million higher, respectively, than operating income for Noble-UK for the same periods. The operating income difference is primarily a result of executive costs directly attributable to Noble-UK for operations support and stewardship related services. In addition, we had non-recurring costs of $63 million and $18 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to the Spin-off, which we recognized as part of discontinued operations at the Noble-UK level.\nRig Utilization, Operating Days and Average Dayrates\nOperating results from continuing operations for our contract drilling services segment are dependent on three primary metrics: rig utilization, operating days and dayrates. The following table sets forth the average rig utilization, operating days and average dayrates for our rig fleet for 2014 and 2013:\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average Rig\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Utilization (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Days (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dayrates\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Jackups\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 177,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 145,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Semisubmersibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 409,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 385,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Drillships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 482,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 403,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 339,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 301,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> We define utilization for a specific period as the total number of days our rigs are operating under contract, divided by the product of the total number of our rigs, including cold stacked rigs, and the number of calendar days in such period.

Changes in contract drilling services revenues for 2014 as compared to 2013 were driven by increases in both average dayrates and operating days. The 13 percent increase in average dayrates increased revenues by approximately $352 million while the 14 percent increase in operating days increased revenues by an additional $341 million.\nThe increase in contract drilling services revenues relates to our drillships and jackups, which generated approximately $636 million and $219 million more revenue, respectively, in 2014. These amounts were offset by decreases in revenues for our semisubmersibles, which declined $162 million from 2013.\nThe increase in drillship revenues was driven by a 61 percent increase in operating days and a 19 percent increase in average dayrates, resulting in a $420 million and a $216 million increase in revenues, respectively, from 2013. The increase in both average dayrates and operating days was primarily the result of the newbuilds Noble Don Taylor, Noble Globetrotter II, Noble Bob Douglas, Noble Sam Croft and Noble Tom Madden, which commenced their contracts in August 2013, September 2013, December 2013, July 2014 and November 2014, respectively. Additionally, there were favorable dayrate changes on the contracts for the Noble Bully II and the Noble Discoverer during 2014.\nThe 22 percent increase in jackup average dayrates resulted in a $118 million increase in revenues, which was coupled with a 23 percent increase in jackup operating days, resulting in a $101 million increase in revenues from 2013. The increase in both average dayrates and operating days resulted from the contract commencements of the Noble Mick O'Brien, Noble Regina Allen, Noble Houston Colbert and Noble Sam Turner in November 2013, January 2014, March 2014 and August 2014, respectively. Additionally, a contract extension on the Noble Roger Lewis resulted in a favorable dayrate change during 2014. This was partially offset by increased downtime on the Noble Scott Marks and the Noble David Tinsley. Furthermore, the Noble Lewis Dugger, which was sold in July 2013, was utilized during a portion of 2013.\nThe 6 percent increase in average dayrates on our semisubmersibles resulted in a $70 million increase in revenues from 2013. The increase in average dayrates was due to favorable dayrate changes on new contracts across the semisubmersible fleet, as well as the Noble Paul Romano returning to work during 2014. The 18 percent decline in operating days resulted in a $232 million decrease in revenues driven by contract completions on the Noble Paul Wolff, Noble Homer Ferrington and Noble Max Smith. Additionally, the Noble Amos Runner was in the shipyard undergoing regulatory inspections and maintenance during a portion of 2014 but operated during 2013.\nOperating Costs and Expenses. Contract drilling services operating costs and expenses increased $332 million for 2014 as compared to 2013. A significant portion of the increase was due to the crew-up and operating expenses for our newbuild rigs as they commenced, or prepared to commence, operating under contracts, which added approximately $322 million in expense in 2014. The remaining change was primarily driven by a $20 million increase in mobilization expense due to certain rig moves and the demobilization of certain rigs, partially offset by a $5 million decrease in operations support and rig-related expenses and a $5 million decrease in rig and operations support labor.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $111 million in 2014 over 2013, which is primarily attributable to newbuild rigs placed in service since the beginning of 2013 as noted above.\nLoss on impairment during 2014 related to a $685 million charge on our semisubmersibles, Noble Driller, Noble Jim Thompson and Noble Paul Wolff, which we decided not to actively market as a result of market conditions. Additionally, we fully impaired the $60 million of goodwill on our books in 2014, which originated from the acquisition of Frontier in 2010, as a result of a significant decline in the market value of our stock, coupled with a decrease in oil and gas prices, significant reductions in the projected dayrates for new contracts and reduced utilization forecasts. Loss on impairment during 2013 was related to our two cold stacked submersible rigs arising from the potential disposition of these assets to an unrelated third party. These submersible rigs were subsequently sold to an unrelated third party in January 2014 for a total sales price of $7 million.\nGain on disposal of assets during 2013 was attributable to the sale of the Noble Lewis Dugger to an unrelated third party in Mexico.\nGain on contract settlements/extinguishments during 2013 was attributable to the $45 million settlement of all claims against the former shareholders of Frontier, which we acquired in July 2010, relating to alleged breaches of various representations and warranties contained in the purchase agreement. A portion of the settlement, totaling approximately $14 million, was allocated to discontinued operations as it related to certain rigs spun-off as part of the Paragon Offshore transaction.\nOther Income and Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses. Overall, general and administrative expenses decreased $11 million in 2014 from 2013 primarily as a result of decreased legal and tax expenses related to ongoing projects.\nInterest Expense, net of amount capitalized. Interest expense, net of amount capitalized, increased $49 million in 2014 from 2013. The increase is a result of lower capitalized interest in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to the completion of construction on four of our newbuild drillships and four of our newbuild jackups, partially offset by the repayment of our $300 million fixed rate senior note in June 2013 and our $250 million fixed rate senior note in March 2014 using availability under our commercial paper program at lower interest rates. During 2014, we capitalized approximately 23 percent of total interest charges versus approximately 52 percent during 2013.\nIncome Tax Provision. Our income tax provision increased $15 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. Excluding the impact of the impairment charges recognized in 2014 and 2013 and the sale of the Noble Lewis Dugger in 2013, taxes increased $58 million driven by a higher worldwide effective tax rate and higher pre-tax income. A 34 percent increase in the worldwide effective tax rate during 2014 increased income tax expense by $36 million. The increase in the worldwide effective tax rate was a result of a change in the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings and the effect of the new UK tax law, which became effective retroactively to April 1, 2014, offset by favorable discrete items. Additionally, a 28 percent increase in pre-tax earnings generated a $22 million increase in income tax expense.\nDiscontinued Operations. Net income from discontinued operations for 2014 was $161 million as compared to $304 million for 2013. Revenues reported within discontinued operations were $1.0 billion during 2014 as compared to $1.7 billion for 2013. Operating income included within discontinued operations was $220 million during 2014 and $381 million for 2013. The variance is attributable to seven months of operations in 2014 versus a full year of operations in 2013, coupled with a $45 million increase in non-recurring Spin-off costs during 2014.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nCash flows from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are combined with cash flows from continuing operations within each cash flow statement category on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Net cash from operating activities in 2015 was $1.8 billion, which compared to $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively. We had working capital of $377 million and $260 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2015 was $433 million, which compared to $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The variance primarily relates to lower capital expenditures related to our newbuild expenditures as projects were completed in prior years, coupled with expenditures for rigs spun-off with Paragon Offshore in 2014 and 2013.\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2015 was $886 million, which compared to net cash provided from financing activities of $285 million and $615 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2015, our primary uses of cash included the repayment of our $350 million 3.45% Senior Notes in August 2015, coupled with shareholder dividend payments of approximately $316 million, the repurchase of 6.2 million shares in 2015 for $101 million and dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of approximately $72 million. Our total debt as a percentage of total debt plus equity decreased to 38 percent at December 31, 2015, down from 40 percent at December 31, 2014 as a result of the repayment of certain maturing notes during 2015. Although we issued $1.1 billion of Senior Notes in March 2015, this amount was substantially offset by a net reduction in indebtedness outstanding on our Credit Facilities and commercial paper program during 2015 as a result of the application of proceeds from the Senior Notes offering.\nOur principal source of capital in 2015 was cash generated from operating activities coupled with the $1.1 billion Senior Notes offering in March 2015. Cash generated during 2015 was primarily used to repay indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Facilities and commercial paper program, pay normal recurring operating expenses and repay our $350 million 3.45% Senior Notes.\nOur currently anticipated cash flow needs, both in the short-term and long-term, may include the following:\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> normal recurring operating expenses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> committed and discretionary capital expenditures;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> repayment of debt; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> payments of dividends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe currently expect to fund these cash flow needs with cash generated by our operations, cash on hand, borrowings under our existing credit facility, potential issuances of long-term debt, or asset sales. However, to adequately cover our expected cash flow needs, we may require capital in excess of the amount available from these sources, and we may seek additional sources of liquidity and/or delay or cancel certain discretionary capital expenditures or other payments as necessary.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had a total contract drilling services backlog of approximately $6.9 billion. Our backlog as of December 31, 2015 includes a commitment of 68 percent of available days for 2016. See Contract Drilling Services Backlog\u201d for additional information regarding our backlog.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures, including capitalized interest, totaled $423 million, $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Capital expenditures during 2015 consisted of the following:\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> $345 million for sustaining capital, major projects, subsea related expenditures and upgrades and replacements to drilling equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> $53 million in newbuild expenditures, including costs for the Noble Lloyd Noble and trailing costs on our recently completed newbuilds; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> $25 million in capitalized interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total capital expenditure budget for 2016 is approximately $800 million, which is currently anticipated to be spent as follows:\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> approximately $461 million in newbuild expenditures; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> $339 million for sustaining capital, major projects, subsea related expenditures and upgrades and replacements to drilling equipment, including capitalized interest that may fluctuate as a result of the timing of completion of ongoing projects.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with our capital expenditure program, we have entered into certain commitments, including shipyard and purchase commitments, for approximately $598 million at December 31, 2015, all of which we expect to spend in 2016.\nFrom time to time we consider possible projects that would require expenditures that are not included in our capital budget, and such unbudgeted expenditures could be significant. In addition, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of drilling units from time to time. Other factors that could cause actual capital expenditures to materially exceed plan include delays and cost overruns in shipyards (including costs attributable to labor shortages), shortages of equipment, latent damage or deterioration to hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions, changes in governmental regulations and requirements and changes in design criteria or specifications during repair or construction.\nDividends\nOur most recent quarterly dividend payment to shareholders, totaling approximately $38 million (or $0.15 per share), was declared on January 29, 2016 and paid on February 16, 2016 to holders of record on February 8, 2016.\nThe declaration and payment of dividends require authorization of the Board of Directors of Noble-UK and such dividends on issued share capital may be paid only out of Noble-UK's distributable reserves\u201d on its statutory balance sheet. Noble-UK is not permitted to pay dividends out of share capital, which includes share premiums. As of December 31, 2015 Noble's distributable reserves are $1.8 billion. The payment of future dividends will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future business prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nShare Repurchases\nUnder UK law, the Company is only permitted to purchase its own shares by way of an off-market purchase\u201d in a plan approved by shareholders. In December 2014, we received shareholder approval to repurchase up to 37 million ordinary shares, or approximately 15 percent of our outstanding ordinary shares at the time of the shareholder approval. The authority to make such repurchases will expire at the end of the Company's 2016 annual general meeting of shareholders. At this time, we do not expect to seek shareholder approval for further repurchases at our 2016 annual general meeting.\nIn January 2015, we repurchased 6.2 million of our ordinary shares at an average price of $16.10 per share, excluding commissions and stamp tax. Including these items, the average price paid per share during January 2015 was $16.21.\nShare repurchases for each of the three years ended December 31 are as follows:\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Number\nof Shares\nPurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Cost (1) (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nPrice Paid\nper Share (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,209,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,769,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 154,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 190,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The total cost and average price paid per share includes the impact of commissions and stamp tax for share repurchases made in the open market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Facilities and Senior Unsecured Notes\nCredit Facilities and Commercial Paper Program\nAt December 31, 2015, we had two credit facilities with an aggregate maximum capacity of $2.7 billion, which are comprised of a five year $2.4 billion senior unsecured credit facility that matures in January 2020 and a $225 million 364-day senior unsecured credit facility that matured in January 2016 and was not renewed (together, the Credit Facilities\u201d).\nWe have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.4 billion in unsecured commercial paper notes. Amounts issued under the commercial paper program are supported by the unused capacity under our credit facility and, therefore, are classified as long-term on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The outstanding amounts of commercial paper reduce availability under our credit facility.\nAs of February 12, 2016, we had no amounts drawn on our credit facility and no commercial paper issued.\nOur credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to $500 million in letters of credit. The issuance of letters of credit under the facility reduces the amount available for borrowing. At February 12, 2016, we had no letters of credit issued under the facility.\nAccess to our commercial paper program is dependent upon our credit ratings. A decline in our credit ratings below investment grade would prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market. If we were unable to access the commercial paper market, we would transfer any outstanding borrowings to our credit facility. Our credit facility has interest rates that are generally higher than those found in the commercial paper market, which would result in increased interest expense in the future.\nIn addition, our credit facility and certain of our senior unsecured notes, as discussed below, have provisions which vary the applicable interest rates based upon our credit ratings. If our credit ratings were to decline, the interest expense under our Credit Facilities and certain of our senior unsecured notes would increase.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOur total debt related to senior unsecured notes was $4.5 billion at December 31, 2015 as compared to $3.7 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase in senior unsecured notes outstanding is a result of the issuance of $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes in March 2015, which we issued through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Noble Holding International Limited ( NHIL\u201d). These Senior Notes were issued in three separate tranches, consisting of $250 million of 4.00% Senior Notes due 2018, $450 million of 5.95% Senior Notes due 2025 and $400 million of 6.95% Senior Notes due 2045. The weighted average coupon of all three tranches is 5.87%. The interest rate on these Senior Notes may be increased if the credit rating applicable to the notes is downgraded below investment grade (up to a maximum of 200 basis points). The net proceeds of approximately $1.08 billion, after expenses, were used to repay indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Facilities and commercial paper program.\nIn August 2015, we repaid our $350 million 3.45% Senior Notes using cash on hand.\nOur $300 million 3.05% Senior Notes matured during the first quarter of 2016. We anticipate using cash on hand to repay the outstanding balances.\nCovenants\nThe Credit Facilities and commercial paper program are guaranteed by our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries, Noble Holding International Limited ( NHIL\u201d) and Noble Holding Corporation ( NHC\u201d). The covenants and events of default under the two Credit\nFacilities are substantially similar, and each facility contains a covenant that limits our ratio of debt to total tangible capitalization, as defined in the Credit Facilities, to 0.60. At December 31, 2015, our ratio of debt to total tangible capitalization was approximately 0.38. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2015.\nIn addition to the covenants from the Credit Facilities noted above, the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes contain covenants that place restrictions on certain merger and consolidation transactions, unless we are the surviving entity or the other party assumes the obligations under the indenture, and on the ability to sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, there are restrictions on incurring or assuming certain liens and on entering into sale and lease-back transactions. At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. We continually monitor compliance with the covenants under our notes and expect to remain in compliance during 2016.\nOther\nAt December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit of $5 million, including bonds covering the temporary importation of equipment, performance bonds and expatriate visa guarantees.\nSummary of Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our

Critical accounting policies and estimates that most significantly impact our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts, those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities in which we hold a controlling financial interest. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of two joint ventures, in each of which\nwe own a 50 percent interest. Our ownership interest meets the definition of variable interest under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) codification and we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe combined joint venture carrying amount of the Bully-class drillships at December 31, 2015 totaled $1.4 billion, which was primarily funded through partner equity contributions. Operating revenues were $334 million, $372 million and $355 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net income totaled $154 million, $157 million and $145 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost, reduced by provisions to recognize economic impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $761 million and $970 million of construction-in-progress, respectively. Such amounts are included in Property and equipment, at cost\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are sold, retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the gain or loss is recognized. Drilling equipment and facilities are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as of the date placed in service or date of major refurbishment. Estimated useful lives of our drilling equipment range from three to thirty years. Other property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over useful lives ranging from two to forty years.\nDuring 2015, we sold for parts the previously retired semisubmersible rigs, the Noble Paul Wolff, the Noble Driller and the Noble Jim Thompson. In connection with the sale of these rigs, we received proceeds of approximately $5 million.\nInterest is capitalized on construction-in-progress using the weighted average cost of debt outstanding during the period of construction. Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $25 million, $47 million and $115 million, respectively.\nScheduled maintenance of equipment is performed based on the number of hours operated in accordance with our preventative maintenance program. Routine repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred; however, the costs of the overhauls and asset replacement projects that benefit future periods and which typically occur every three to five years are capitalized when incurred and depreciated over an equivalent period. These overhauls and asset replacement projects are included in Property and equipment, at cost\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts, net of accumulated depreciation, totaled $202 million and $179 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Depreciation expense from continuing operations related to overhauls and asset replacement totaled $75 million, $77 million and $70 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe evaluate the impairment of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, on an annual basis, we complete an impairment analysis on our rig fleet. An impairment loss on our property and equipment exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset's carrying value over the estimated fair value. As part of this analysis, we make assumptions and estimates regarding future market conditions. To the extent actual results do not meet our estimated assumptions, for a given rig class, we may take an impairment loss in the future.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, in connection with our annual impairment analysis, we decided that we would no longer market one of our drillships, the Noble Discoverer. The decision was a result of the termination of the contract for this rig by Shell in December 2015 and the decreased opportunities for rigs of this type in the current marketplace. We also reviewed assumptions on the future marketability of one of our jackups, the Noble Charles Copeland, after its contract completion in late September 2015, with consideration given to its years in service, limited technical features and anticipated capital requirements in light of the current market conditions. As a result of this analysis, we have decided to discontinue marketing this unit. Additionally, as a result of a fourth quarter review of capital spare equipment, we elected to retire certain capital spare equipment. In connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, we evaluated these units and certain capital spare equipment for impairment and recorded an impairment charge of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAlso in 2015, we determined that certain corporate assets were partially impaired due to a declining market for, and the potential disposal of, the assets. We estimated the fair value of the assets based on quotes from brokers of similar assets (Level 2). Based on these estimates, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring 2014, we recorded a $685 million impairment charge on three of our semisubmersibles, the Noble Driller, the Noble Jim Thompson and the Noble Paul Wolff, which we decided to no longer actively market as a result of the declining market conditions.\nDuring 2012, we recorded a $13 million impairment charge on our submersible fleet, primarily as a result of the declining market outlook for drilling services for that rig type. During 2013, we recorded an additional impairment charge of approximately $4 million on our two cold stacked submersible rigs arising from the potential disposition of these assets to an unrelated third party. In January 2014, we completed the sale of the submersibles for a total sales price of $7 million.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur typical dayrate drilling contracts require our performance of a variety of services for a specified period of time. We determine progress towards completion of the contract by measuring efforts expended and the cost of services required to perform under a drilling contract, as the basis for our revenue recognition. Revenues generated from our dayrate-basis drilling contracts and labor contracts are recognized on a per day basis as services are performed and begin upon the contract commencement, as defined under the specified drilling or labor contract. Dayrate revenues are typically earned, and contract drilling expenses are typically incurred ratably over the term of our drilling contracts. We review and monitor our performance under our drilling contracts to confirm the basis for our revenue recognition. Revenues from bonuses are recognized when earned, and when collectability is reasonably assured.\nIn our dayrate drilling contracts, we typically receive compensation and incur costs for mobilization, equipment modification or other activities prior to the commencement of a contract. Any such compensation may be paid through a lump-sum payment or other daily compensation. Pre-contract compensation and costs are deferred until the contract commences. The deferred pre-contract compensation and costs are amortized into income, using the straight-line method, over the term of the initial contract period, regardless of the activity taking place. This approach is consistent with the economics for which the parties have contracted. Once a contract commences, we may conduct various activities, including drilling and well bore related activities, rig maintenance and equipment installation, movement between well locations or other activities.\nDeferred revenues from drilling contracts totaled $180 million and $263 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Such amounts are included in either Other current liabilities\u201d or Other liabilities\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based upon our expected time of recognition. Related expenses deferred under drilling contracts totaled $78 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to $94 million at December 31, 2014, and are included in either Prepaid expenses and other current assets\u201d or Other assets\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based upon our expected time of recognition.\nIn April 2015, we agreed to contract dayrate reductions for five rigs working for Saudi Aramco, which were effective from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. However, given current market conditions and based on discussions with the customer, we do not expect the rates to return to the original contract rates. In accordance with accounting guidance, we are recognizing the reductions on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the existing Saudi Aramco contracts. At December 31, 2015, revenues recorded in excess of billings as a result of this recognition totaled $53 million, and are included in either Prepaid expenses and other current assets\u201d or Other assets\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based upon our expected time of recognition.\nWe record reimbursements from customers for out-of-pocket\u201d expenses as revenues and the related direct cost as operating expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nWe operate in a number of countries throughout the world and our tax returns filed in those jurisdictions are subject to review and examination by tax authorities within those jurisdictions. We recognize uncertain tax positions that we believe have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained. We cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any existing or future assessments.\nDuring 2014, the IRS began its examination of our tax reporting in the U.S. for the taxable years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011. We believe that we have accurately reported all amounts in our 2010 and 2011 tax returns. We believe the ultimate resolution of the IRS examination will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nUnder the tax sharing agreement ( TSA\u201d) entered into at the time of the Spin-off, Noble and Paragon Offshore are each responsible for the taxes that relate to their respective business and provide a corresponding indemnity. In addition, in February 2016, we entered into an agreement in principle with Paragon Offshore (the Agreement in Principle\u201d) relating to tax matters in Mexico described below in exchange for a full and unconditional release of any claims by Paragon Offshore in connection with the Spin-off (including any claims that could be brought on behalf of its creditors).\nAudit claims of approximately $174 million attributable to income and other business taxes have been assessed against us in Mexico, as detailed below. Under our Agreement in Principle, we agreed to assume the administration of Paragon Offshore's Mexican income and value-added taxes for the years 2005 through 2010 and for Paragon Offshore's Mexican customs taxes through\n2010, as well as the related bonding obligations and certain of the tax related liabilities. In addition, under the Agreement in Principle, we would (i) pay all of the ultimate resolved amount of Mexican income and value-added taxes related to Paragon Offshore's business that were incurred through a Noble-retained entity, (ii) pay 50 percent of the ultimate resolved amount of Mexican income and value-added taxes related to Paragon Offshore's business that were incurred through a Paragon Offshore-retained entity, (iii) pay 50 percent of the ultimate resolved amount of Mexican custom taxes related to Paragon Offshore's business, and (iv) be required to post any tax appeal bond that may be required to challenge a final assessment. Tax assessments of approximately $50 million for income and value-added taxes have been made against Noble entities in Mexico. Tax assessments for income and value-added taxes of approximately $202 million have been made against Paragon Offshore entities in Mexico, of which approximately $46 million relates to Noble's business that operated through Paragon Offshore-retained entities in Mexico prior to the Spin-off. We will only be obligated to post a tax appeal bond in the event a final assessment is made by Mexican authorities. As of February 12, 2016, there have only been $3 million in final assessments that have been bonded.\nIn January, 2015, Noble received an official notification of a ruling from the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court in Mexico. The ruling settled an ongoing dispute in Mexico relating to the classification of a Noble subsidiary's business activity and the applicable rate of depreciation under the Mexican law applicable to the activities of that subsidiary. The ruling did not result in any additional tax liability to Noble. Additionally, the ruling is only applicable to the Noble subsidiary named in the ruling and, therefore, does not establish the depreciation rate applicable to the assets of other Noble subsidiaries. Under the Agreement in Principle, we would be responsible for any tax liability ultimately incurred because these depreciation liabilities would be incurred by Noble-retained entities, and such amounts are reflected in the discussion of Mexican audit claims in the preceding paragraph. We will continue to contest future assessments received, and do not believe we are liable for additional tax.\nParagon Offshore has received tax assessments of approximately $122 million attributable to income, customs and other business taxes in Brazil, of which $38 million relates to Noble's business that operated through a Paragon Offshore-retained entity in Brazil prior to the Spin-off. Under the TSA, we must indemnify Paragon Offshore for all assessed amounts that are related to Noble's Brazil business, approximately $38 million, if and when such payments become due.\nWe have contested, or intend to contest or cooperate with Paragon Offshore in Brazil where it is contesting, the assessments described above, including through litigation if necessary, and we believe the ultimate resolution, for which we have not made any accrual, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Tax authorities may issue additional assessments or pursue legal actions as a result of tax audits and we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of such assessments and legal actions or our ability to collect indemnities from Paragon Offshore under the TSA or the Agreement in Principle.\nWe have been notified by Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. ( Petrobras\u201d) that it is currently challenging assessments by Brazilian tax authorities of withholding taxes associated with the provision of drilling rigs for its operations in Brazil during 2008 and 2009. Petrobras has also notified us that if Petrobras must ultimately pay such withholding taxes, it will seek reimbursement from us for the portion allocable to our drilling rigs. The amount of withholding tax that Petrobras indicates may be allocable to Noble drilling rigs is R$79 million (approximately $20 million). We believe that our contract with Petrobras requires Petrobras to indemnify us for these withholding taxes. We will, if necessary, vigorously defend our rights.\nIn certain circumstances, we expect that, due to changing demands of the offshore drilling markets and the ability to redeploy our offshore drilling units, certain units will not reside in a location long enough to give rise to future tax consequences. As a result, no deferred tax asset or liability has been recognized in these circumstances. Should our expectations change regarding the length of time an offshore drilling unit will be used in a given location, we will adjust deferred taxes accordingly.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe maintain various levels of self-insured retention for certain losses including property damage, loss of hire, employment practices liability, employers' liability and general liability, among others. We accrue for property damage and loss of hire charges on a per event basis.\nEmployment practices liability claims are accrued based on actual claims during the year. Maritime employer's liability claims are generally estimated using actuarial determinations. General liability claims are estimated by our internal claims department by evaluating the facts and circumstances of each claim (including incurred but not reported claims) and making estimates based upon historical experience with similar claims. At both December 31, 2015 and 2014, loss reserves for personal injury and protection claims totaled $21 million, and such amounts are included in Other current liabilities\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCertain Significant Estimates and Contingent Liabilities\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. In addition, we are involved in several litigation matters, some of which could lead to potential liability to us. We follow FASB standards regarding contingent liabilities which are discussed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18-Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-08, which amends FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 205, Presentation of Financial Statements\u201d and ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment.\u201d This ASU alters the definition of a discontinued operation to cover only asset disposals that are a strategic shift with a major effect on an entity's operations and finances, and calls for more extensive disclosures about a discontinued operation's assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The guidance is effective for all disposals, or classifications as held-for-sale, of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. This standard was not early adopted in connection with the Spin-off. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, which creates ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition,\u201d including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. In addition, ASU 2014-09 supersedes the cost guidance in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts,\u201d and creates new Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs-Contracts with Customers.\u201d In summary, the core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. Companies are allowed to select between two transition methods: (1) a full retrospective transition method with the application of the new guidance to each prior reporting period presented, or (2) a retrospective transition method that recognizes the cumulative effect on prior periods at the date of adoption together with additional footnote disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early application is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and have not made any decision on the method of adoption.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation.\u201d The guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition and should not be reflected in the estimate of the grant-date fair value of the award. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The guidance can be applied prospectively for all awards granted or modified after the effective date or retrospectively to all awards with performance targets outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, which amends ASC Subtopic 205-40, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to continue as a Going Concern.\u201d The amendments in this ASU provide guidance related to management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, which amends ASC Subtopic 225-20, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items.\u201d The amendment in this ASU eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. The amendments in this\nupdate are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, which amends ASC Subtopic 810, Consolidations.\u201d This amendment affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, the amendments modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities; eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The standard may be applied retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, which amends ASC Subtopic 835-30, Interest - Imputation of Interest.\u201d The guidance requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the associated debt liability. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The new guidance will be applied on a retrospective basis. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15 which amends ASC Subtopic 835-30, Interest - Imputation of Interest.\u201d The guidance allows a debt issuance cost related to a line-of-credit to be presented in the balance sheet as an asset and subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the line-of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-04, which amends ASC Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits.\u201d The guidance gives an employer whose fiscal year end does not coincide with a calendar month end the ability, as a practical expedient, to measure defined benefit retirement obligations and related plan assets as of the month end that is closest to its fiscal year end. The ASU also provides a similar practical expedient for interim remeasurements of significant events. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-12, which amends ASC Topic 960, Plan Accounting-Defined Benefit Pension Plans,\u201d ASC Topic 962, Defined Contribution Pension Plans\u201d and ASC Topic 965, Health and Welfare Benefit Plans.\u201d There are three parts to the ASU that aim to simplify the accounting and presentation of plan accounting. Part I of this ASU requires fully benefit-responsive investment contracts to be measured at contract value instead of the current fair value measurement. Part II of this ASU requires investments (both participant-directed and nonparticipant-directed investments) of employee benefit plans be grouped only by general type, eliminating the need to disaggregate the investments in multiple ways. Part III of this ASU provides a similar measurement date practical expedient for employee benefit plans as available in ASU No. 2015-04, which allows employers to measure defined benefit plan assets on a month-end date that is nearest to the year's fiscal year-end when the fiscal period does not coincide with a month-end. Parts I and II of the new guidance should be applied on a retrospective basis. Part III of the new guidance should be applied on a prospective basis. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, which amends Topic 805, Business Combinations.\u201d This amendment eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, and revise comparative information for prior periods presented in financial statements. Those adjustments are required when new information about circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date would have affected the measurement of the amount initially recognized. This update requires an entity to recognize these adjustments in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. An acquirer must record the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. An entity must present separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment had been recognized as of the acquisition date. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, which amends ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.\u201d This amendment aligns the presentation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities with International Financial Reporting Standards. International Accounting Standard 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets be offset and presented as\na single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments in this update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and our results of operations for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed by Noble-UK and Noble-Cayman.\nThe results of operations for Paragon Offshore prior to August 1, 2014, the Spin-off date, and non-recurring costs related to the Spin-off have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report. The terms earnings\u201d and loss\u201d as used in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d refer to income/(loss) from continuing operations. Income/(loss) from continuing operations is representative of the Company's current business operations and focus.\nExecutive Overview\nOur 2015 financial and operating results from continuing operations include:\n \u00b7 operating revenues totaling $3.4 billion; \n \u00b7 net income of $511 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, which includes a $418 million after-tax impairment charge recognized on two of our rigs, certain capital spare equipment and certain corporate assets; \n \u00b7 net cash from operating activities totaling $1.8 billion; and \n \u00b7 a decrease in debt to 38 percent of total capitalization at the end of 2015, down from 40 percent at the end of 2014 as a result of the repayment of certain maturing notes during the current year. \nThe business environment for offshore drillers during 2015 remained challenging. The rig capacity imbalance, caused in part by the addition of newbuild units and rigs completing current contracts, increased while customer demand for these rigs has decreased. Beginning in June 2014, the price of oil, a key factor in determining customer activity levels, began to decline rapidly, with the Brent crude price declining from approximately $112 per barrel on June 30, 2014 to approximately $37 per barrel on December 31, 2015. In this environment, operators have curtailed drilling programs, especially exploration activity, resulting in a dramatic reduction in dayrates for new contracts, as well as lower rig utilization. While there have been a number of rig retirements in 2015 and early 2016, the rig capacity imbalance has not corrected.\nWe expect that the business environment for 2016 will remain challenging and could potentially deteriorate further. The present level of global economic activity, the potential increase of oil supply from Iran and a lack of production cuts within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are contributing to an uncertain oil price environment, leading to a persistent disruption in our customers' exploration and production spending plans. Capital expenditures undertaken by the offshore drilling industry in recent years have increased the supply of drilling rigs and current and expected demand from customers during 2016 is not expected to support this current supply. We cannot give any assurances as to when these conditions in the offshore drilling market will improve, or when there will be higher demand for contract drilling services or a decline in the supply of available drilling rigs. While current market conditions persist, we will continue to focus on operating efficiency, cost control and operating margin preservation, which could include the stacking or retirement of additional drilling rigs.\nWe believe in the long-term fundamentals for the industry, especially for those contractors with a modern fleet of high-specification rigs like ours. Also, we believe the ultimate market recovery will benefit from any sustained under-investment by customers during this current market phase.\nOur business strategy focuses on deepwater drilling and high-specification jackups and the deployment of our drilling rigs in important oil and gas basins around the world.\nWe have expanded our offshore deepwater drilling and high-specification jackup capabilities through the construction of rigs. Currently, we have one newbuild project remaining, the heavy-duty, harsh environment jackup, Noble Lloyd Noble, which is scheduled to commence operations under a four-year contract in the North Sea during the third quarter of 2016. Although we plan to focus on capital preservation and liquidity because of current market conditions, we also plan to continue to evaluate opportunities as they arise from time to time to enhance our fleet, particularly focusing on higher specification rigs, to execute the increasingly more complex drilling programs required by our customers.\nWhile we cannot predict the future level of demand or dayrates for our services, or future conditions in the offshore contract drilling industry, we believe we are strategically well positioned.\nImpairment\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, in connection with our annual impairment analysis, we decided that we would no longer market one of our drillships, the Noble Discoverer. The decision was a result of the termination of the contract for this rig by Shell in December 2015 and the decreased opportunities for rigs of this type in the current marketplace. We also reviewed assumptions on the future marketability of one of our jackups, the Noble Charles Copeland, after its contract completion in late September 2015, with consideration given to its years in service, limited technical features and anticipated capital requirements in light of the current market conditions. As a result of this analysis, we have decided to discontinue marketing this unit. Additionally, as a result of a fourth quarter review of capital spare equipment, we elected to retire certain capital spare equipment. As a result of our analysis discussed above, we recorded an impairment charge of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAlso in 2015, we determined that certain corporate assets were partially impaired due to a declining market for, and the potential disposal of, the assets. We estimated the fair value of the assets based on quotes from brokers of similar assets (Level 2). Based on these estimates, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we decided to discontinue marketing three of our semisubmersibles, the Noble Driller, the Noble Jim Thompson and the Noble Paul Wolff, as a result of the market conditions. We evaluated these units for impairments and recorded an impairment charge of $685 million on these units. Additionally, we fully impaired the $60 million of goodwill on our books, which originated from the acquisition of FDR Holdings Limited ( Frontier\u201d) in 2010, as a result of a significant decline in the market value of our stock, a decrease in oil and gas prices, significant reductions in the projected dayrates for new contracts and reduced utilization forecasts.\nWe evaluate the impairment of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, on an annual basis, we complete an impairment analysis on our rig fleet. An impairment loss on our property and equipment exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset's carrying value over the estimated fair value. As part of this analysis, we make assumptions and estimates regarding future market conditions. To the extent actual results do not meet our estimated assumptions, for a given rig class, we may take an impairment loss in the future.\nSpin-off of Paragon Offshore plc\nOn August 1, 2014, Noble-UK completed the separation and spin-off of a majority of its standard specification offshore drilling business through a pro rata distribution of all of the ordinary shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Paragon Offshore, to the holders of Noble's ordinary shares. Our shareholders received one share of Paragon Offshore for every three shares of Noble owned as of July 23, 2014, the record date for the distribution. Through the Spin-off, we disposed of most of our standard specification drilling units and related assets, liabilities and business. Prior to the Spin-off, Paragon Offshore issued approximately $1.7 billion of long-term debt. We used the proceeds from this debt to repay certain amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. The results of operations for Paragon Offshore prior to the Spin-off date and incremental Spin-off related costs have been classified as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. There were no discontinued operations in 2015.\nIn February 2016, we entered into an agreement in principle for a settlement with Paragon Offshore under which, in exchange for a full and unconditional release of any claims by Paragon Offshore in connection with the Spin-off (including certain claims that could be brought on behalf of Paragon Offshore's creditors), we agreed to assume the administration of Mexican tax claims for specified years up to and including 2010, as well as the related bonding obligations and certain of the related tax liabilities. The agreement is subject to approval of the bankruptcy court following Paragon Offshore's filing of a pre-negotiated bankruptcy plan. For additional information regarding the Spin-off, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2-Spin-off of Paragon Offshore plc\u201d and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18-Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nPrior to the completion of the Spin-off, Noble and Paragon Offshore entered into a series of agreements to effect the separation and Spin-off and govern the relationship between the parties after the Spin-off.\nMaster Separation Agreement ( MSA\u201d)\nThe general terms and conditions relating to the separation and Spin-off are set forth in the MSA. The MSA identifies the assets transferred, liabilities assumed and contracts assigned either to Paragon Offshore by us or by Paragon Offshore to us in the separation and describes when and how these transfers, assumptions and assignments would occur. The MSA provides for, among other things, Paragon Offshore's responsibility for liabilities relating to its business and the responsibility of Noble for liabilities related to our, and in certain limited cases, Paragon Offshore's business, in each case irrespective of when the liability arose. The MSA also contains indemnification obligations and ongoing commitments by us and Paragon Offshore.\nEmployee Matters Agreement ( EMA\u201d)\nThe EMA allocates liabilities and responsibilities between us and Paragon Offshore relating to employment, compensation and benefits and other employment related matters.\nTax Sharing Agreement\nThe tax sharing agreement provides for the allocation of tax liabilities and benefits between us and Paragon Offshore and governs the parties' assistance with tax-related claims.\nTransition Services Agreements\nUnder two transition services agreements, we agreed to continue, for a limited period of time, to provide various interim support services to Paragon Offshore, and Paragon Offshore agreed to provide various interim support services to us, including providing operational and administrative support for our remaining Brazilian operations.\nContract Drilling Services Backlog\nWe maintain a backlog (as defined below) of commitments for contract drilling services. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2015, the amount of our contract drilling services backlog and the percent of available operating days committed for the periods indicated:\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract Drilling Services Backlog\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Semisubmersibles/Drillships (1)(3)(4)(6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Jackups\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percent of Available Days Committed (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Semisubmersibles/Drillships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Jackups\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) The drilling contracts with Royal Dutch Shell plc ( Shell\u201d) for the Noble Globetrotter I, Noble Globetrotter II and Noble Don Taylor provide opportunities for us to earn performance bonuses based on key performance indicators as defined by the contracts. With respect to these contracts, we have reduced the percentage of the potential performance bonuses for these rigs to zero reflecting a net reduction to our backlog of approximately $101 million reflecting the current environment in which the payment of bonuses is less likely. \n (2) Some of our drilling contracts provide the customer with certain early termination rights and, in very limited cases, these termination rights require minimal or no notice and financial penalties. However, we have not received any notification of contract cancellations as of February 12, 2016, aside from the Noble Discoverer which has been reflected in this report and for which we received a termination payment of $133.5 million during 2015. \nOur Saudi Aramco contract rates were adjusted downward for 2015 for purposes of the backlog. Backlog for the remaining four contracts previously reflected the original, pre-adjustment contract rates. However, given current market conditions and based on discussions with the customer, we do not expect the rates to return to the original contract rates. Instead, we expect the contract rates to be in the general range of the amended rates for 2015 through the end of each respective contract, which would reduce the backlog for those rigs by approximately $253 million or potentially by a greater amount should negotiations lead to a lower dayrate. Backlog for these contracts has now been prepared assuming the reduced rates for 2015 apply for the remainder of the contract.\n (3) Three of our long-term contracts with Shell, the Noble Globetrotter I, Noble Globetrotter II and Noble Bully II, contain dayrate adjustment clauses after the initial five-year contract term. After the initial five-year term, dayrates adjust up or down every six months based on a discount to a market basket of comparable dayrates, all as defined in the contracts. These contracts commence indexing in April 2017, July 2017 and September 2018 for the Noble Bully II, Noble Globetrotter I and Noble Globetrotter II, respectively. There can be no assurance regarding the level of future dayrates under these market-indexed contracts. For every $50,000 change in dayrate under each of these contracts, backlog would be adjusted by $275 million in the aggregate. The backlog shown herein assumes the initial dayrate continues for the entirety of the contract because of the lack of relevant available market data. Should the current adverse market conditions persist into 2017, 2018 or beyond, we would expect a material reduction to dayrates as compared to the initial five-year term rate. \n (4) The drilling contracts for the Noble Sam Croft and Noble Tom Madden remain under contract with Freeport-McMoRan Inc. ( Freeport\u201d) into July 2017 and November 2017, respectively. Freeport has announced plans to reduce the number of rigs it utilizes in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We are currently in discussion with Freeport regarding these contracts to determine whether there is a mutually beneficial arrangement that appropriately addresses the interests of each party. The ultimate impact to backlog from these discussions is uncertain. The amount of backlog attributable to the Freeport contracts is currently $795 million or 12 percent of total backlog. \n (5) Percent of available days committed is calculated by dividing the total number of days our rigs are operating under contract for such period, or committed days, by the product of the total number of our rigs, including cold stacked rigs, and the number of calendar days in such period. Committed days do not include the days that a rig is stacked or the days that a rig is expected to be out of service for significant overhaul, repairs or maintenance. Percentages take into account additional capacity from the estimated dates of deployment of our newbuild rigs that are scheduled to commence operations during 2016. \n (6) Noble and a subsidiary of Shell are involved in joint ventures that own and operate both the Noble Bully I and the Noble Bully II. Under the terms of the joint venture agreements, each party has an equal 50 percent share in both rigs. As of December 31, 2015, the combined amount of backlog for these rigs totals approximately $1.3 billion, all of which is included in our backlog. Noble's proportional interest in the backlog for these rigs totals $632 million. \nOur contract drilling services backlog reflects estimated future revenues attributable to both signed drilling contracts and letters of intent that we expect to result in binding drilling contracts. A letter of intent is generally subject to customary conditions, including the execution of a definitive drilling contract. It is possible that some customers that have entered into letters of intent will not enter into signed drilling contracts. As of December 31, 2015, our contract drilling services backlog did not include any letters of intent.\nWe calculate backlog for any given unit and period by multiplying the full contractual operating dayrate for such unit by the number of days remaining in the period. The reported contract drilling services backlog does not include amounts representing revenues for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation, which are not expected to be significant to our contract drilling services revenues, amounts constituting reimbursables from customers or amounts attributable to uncommitted option periods under drilling contracts or letters of intent.\nThe amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned may be materially different than the backlog amounts and backlog periods set forth in the table above due to various factors, including, but not limited to, shipyard and maintenance projects, unplanned downtime, the operation of market benchmarks for dayrate resets, achievement of bonuses, weather conditions, reduced standby or mobilization rates and other factors that result in applicable dayrates lower than the full contractual operating dayrate. In addition, amounts included in the backlog may change because drilling contracts may be varied or modified by mutual consent or customers may exercise early termination rights contained in some of our drilling contracts or decline to enter into a drilling contract after executing a letter of intent. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual operating results for the periods for which the backlog is calculated. Please read Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors-We can provide no assurance that our current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized.\u201d\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2015 Compared to 2014\nGeneral\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to Noble-UK for 2015 was $511 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.4 billion, compared to net loss from continuing operations for 2014 of $152 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.2 billion.\nAs a result of Noble-UK conducting all of its business through Noble-Cayman and its subsidiaries, the financial position and results of operations for Noble-Cayman, and the reasons for material changes in the amount of revenue and expense items between 2015 and 2014, would be the same as the information presented below regarding Noble-UK in all material respects, except operating income for Noble-Cayman for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $29 million and $50 million higher, respectively, than operating income for Noble-UK for the same periods. The operating income difference is primarily a result of executive costs directly attributable to Noble-UK for operations support and stewardship related services. In addition, we had non-recurring costs of $63 million in 2014 related to the Spin-off, which we recognized as part of discontinued operations at the Noble-UK level.\nRig Utilization, Operating Days and Average Dayrates\nOperating results from continuing operations for our contract drilling services segment are dependent on three primary metrics: rig utilization, operating days and dayrates. The following table sets forth the average rig utilization, operating days and average dayrates for our rig fleet for 2015 and 2014:\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average Rig\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Utilization (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Days (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dayrates\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Jackups\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 177,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Semisubmersibles(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 445,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 409,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Drillships(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 547,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 482,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> **\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> **\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 358,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 339,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) We define utilization for a specific period as the total number of days our rigs are operating under contract, divided by the product of the total number of our rigs, including cold stacked rigs, and the number of calendar days in such period.

Changes in the amount of these reimbursables generally do not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n ** Not a meaningful percentage. \nOperating Revenues. Changes in contract drilling services revenues for the current year as compared to the prior year were driven by a 6 percent increase in average dayrates, partially offset by a 2 percent decrease in operating days. The 6 percent increase in average dayrates increased revenues by approximately $175 million, while the 2 percent decrease in operating days decreased revenues by $61 million.\nThe increase in contract drilling services revenues relates to our drillships which generated approximately $453 million more revenue in 2015. This amount was offset by decreases in revenues for our semisubmersibles and jackups, which declined by $330 million and $9 million, respectively, from the prior year.\nDuring the current year, we recognized $145 million of dayrate revenues related to the Noble Discoverer cancellation agreement with Shell. Excluding the cancellation agreement, drillship revenues increased by $308 million driven by an 18 percent increase in operating days and a 4 percent increase in average dayrates, resulting in a $242 million and a $66 million increase in revenues, respectively, from the prior year. The increase in both average dayrates and operating days was the result of a full year of operations from the Noble Sam Croft and the Noble Tom Madden, which commenced operations in July 2014 and November 2014, respectively.\nDuring the current year, we recognized $137 million of dayrate revenues related to the Noble Homer Ferrington arbitration award. Excluding the arbitration award, semisubmersible revenues decreased by $467 million driven by a 34 percent decline in operating days and a 9 percent decline in average dayrates, resulting in a $397 million and a $70 million decline in revenues, respectively, from the prior year. The decrease in both operating days and average dayrates was primarily attributable to the retirement of the Noble Jim Thompson, the Noble Driller and the Noble Paul Wolff as a result of our decision to retire these rigs based on the declining market conditions. Additionally, the Noble Max Smith was operational during the prior year but was off contract during the current year and the Noble Paul Romano was operational during the prior year but was off contract for a significant portion of the current year. This was partially offset by the Noble Amos Runner, which operated during the current year but was in the shipyard undergoing regulatory inspections and maintenance during a portion of the prior year.\nThe decrease in jackup revenues was driven by an 8 percent decrease in average dayrates, which resulted in a $59 million decrease in revenues driven by unfavorable dayrate changes on contracts across the jackup fleet. This was partially offset by an 8 percent increase in operating days, which resulted in a $50 million increase in revenues from the prior year. The increase in operating days was the result of a full year of revenue from the Noble Houston Colbert and the Noble Sam Turner, which began operations in March 2014 and August 2014, respectively, coupled with the commencement of the Noble Tom Prosser during October 2015. Additionally, the Noble David Tinsley experienced full utilization in the current year but was off contract for a majority of the prior year. This was partially offset by the Noble Mick O'Brien, which was available during the current year but was under contract for a substantial portion of 2014.\nOperating Costs and Expenses. Contract drilling services operating costs and expenses decreased $268 million for the current year as compared to the prior year. This was due to decreased costs of $117 million related to the retirement of the Noble Jim Thompson, the Noble Driller and the Noble Paul Wolff and $83 million related to idle or stacked rigs. This was partially offset by crew-up and operating expenses for our newbuild rigs as they commenced, or prepared to commence, operating under contracts, which added approximately $118 million in expense in the current year. Excluding these factors, contract drilling services costs decreased by $186 million. This decrease was driven by a $41 million decrease in labor costs due to the termination of retention bonuses and decreases in certain non-contractual crew positions, a $40 million decrease in mobilization and transportation expenses related to certain rig moves during the prior year, a $32 million decrease in repair and maintenance costs, a $24 million decrease in operations support costs, a $16 million decrease in other rig-related expenses, an $11 million decrease in insurance costs related to our policy renewal in March 2015, a $12 million decrease in fuel and travel rotational expenses and a $10 million decrease for the reimbursement of costs and fees related to the Noble Homer Ferrington arbitration award during the current year that were previously recognized through contract drilling services operating costs and expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $3 million in 2015 over 2014, which is primarily attributable to newbuild rigs placed in service partially offset by the retirement of the three semisubmersible rigs discussed above.\nLoss on impairment during the current year of $406 million relates to the Noble Discoverer and the Noble Charles Copeland, which we elected to discontinue marketing due to current market conditions. Additionally, as a result of a fourth quarter review of capital spare equipment, we elected to retire certain capital spare equipment. Loss on impairment during the prior year of $745 million relates to a $685 million charge on three of our semisubmersibles, the Noble Driller, the Noble Jim Thompson and the Noble Paul Wolff, which we decided not to actively market as a result of the declining market conditions, and a $60 million impairment charge for goodwill that originated from the acquisition of Frontier in 2010.\nOther Income and Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses. Overall, general and administrative expenses decreased $30 million in 2015 from 2014, primarily as a result of decreased office and other expenses of $13 million, employee related costs of $10 million and legal and other professional fees of $7 million.\nInterest Expense, net of amount capitalized. Interest expense, net of amount capitalized, increased $59 million in 2015 from 2014. The increase is a result of the issuance of $1.1 billion of Senior Notes in March 2015, coupled with lower capitalized interest in the current year as compared to the prior year due primarily to the completion of construction on four of our newbuild jackups and two of our newbuild drillships. During the current year, we capitalized approximately 10 percent of total interest charges versus approximately 23 percent during the prior year.\nInterest Income and Other, Net. Interest income and other, net increased $38 million in the current year as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily the result of $30 million of interest income recognized in connection with the Noble Homer Ferrington arbitration award, coupled with $5 million of interest received on a U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) tax refund for the years 2006 and 2007 during the current year.\nIncome Tax Provision. Our income tax provision increased $53 million in the current year, of which $27 million related to the Noble Homer Ferrington arbitration award. Excluding the arbitration award, our income tax provision increased by $26 million. Excluding the impact of the impairment charges recognized in 2015 and 2014 and the Noble Discoverer contract cancellation payment in the fourth quarter of 2015, taxes decreased $7 million as a result of a lower worldwide effective tax rate, partially offset by higher pre-tax income. The 13 percent decrease in the worldwide effective tax rate during the current year generated a $19 million decrease to income tax expense, and was primarily a result of the geographic mix of pre-tax income, the effect of lower downtime and various discrete items. This was partially offset by a 9 percent increase in pre-tax earnings, which generated a $12 million increase in income tax expense.\nDiscontinued Operations. There was no activity related to discontinued operations during the current year. During the prior year, net income from discontinued operations was $161 million. In 2014, revenues reported within discontinued operations were $1.0 billion and operating income included within discontinued operations was $220 million.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nGeneral\nNet loss from continuing operations attributable to Noble-UK for 2014 was $152 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.2 billion, compared to net income from continuing operations for 2013 of $479 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $2.5 billion.\nAs a result of Noble-UK conducting all of its business through Noble-Cayman and its subsidiaries, the financial position and results of operations for Noble-Cayman, and the reasons for material changes in the amount of revenue and expense items between 2014 and 2013, would be the same as the information presented below regarding Noble-UK in all material respects, except operating income for Noble-Cayman for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $50 million and $65 million higher, respectively, than operating income for Noble-UK for the same periods. The operating income difference is primarily a result of executive costs directly attributable to Noble-UK for operations support and stewardship related services. In addition, we had non-recurring costs of $63 million and $18 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to the Spin-off, which we recognized as part of discontinued operations at the Noble-UK level.\nRig Utilization, Operating Days and Average Dayrates\nOperating results from continuing operations for our contract drilling services segment are dependent on three primary metrics: rig utilization, operating days and dayrates. The following table sets forth the average rig utilization, operating days and average dayrates for our rig fleet for 2014 and 2013:\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average Rig\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Operating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Utilization (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Days (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Dayrates\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Jackups\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 177,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 145,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Semisubmersibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 409,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 385,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Drillships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 482,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 403,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 339,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 301,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) We define utilization for a specific period as the total number of days our rigs are operating under contract, divided by the product of the total number of our rigs, including cold stacked rigs, and the number of calendar days in such period.

Changes in the amount of these reimbursables generally do not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n ** Not a meaningful percentage. \nOperating Revenues. Changes in contract drilling services revenues for 2014 as compared to 2013 were driven by increases in both average dayrates and operating days. The 13 percent increase in average dayrates increased revenues by approximately $352 million while the 14 percent increase in operating days increased revenues by an additional $341 million.\nThe increase in contract drilling services revenues relates to our drillships and jackups, which generated approximately $636 million and $219 million more revenue, respectively, in 2014. These amounts were offset by decreases in revenues for our semisubmersibles, which declined $162 million from 2013.\nThe increase in drillship revenues was driven by a 61 percent increase in operating days and a 19 percent increase in average dayrates, resulting in a $420 million and a $216 million increase in revenues, respectively, from 2013. The increase in both average dayrates and operating days was primarily the result of the newbuilds Noble Don Taylor, Noble Globetrotter II, Noble Bob Douglas, Noble Sam Croft and Noble Tom Madden, which commenced their contracts in August 2013, September 2013, December 2013, July 2014 and November 2014, respectively. Additionally, there were favorable dayrate changes on the contracts for the Noble Bully II and the Noble Discoverer during 2014.\nThe 22 percent increase in jackup average dayrates resulted in a $118 million increase in revenues, which was coupled with a 23 percent increase in jackup operating days, resulting in a $101 million increase in revenues from 2013. The increase in both average dayrates and operating days resulted from the contract commencements of the Noble Mick O'Brien, Noble Regina Allen, Noble Houston Colbert and Noble Sam Turner in November 2013, January 2014, March 2014 and August 2014, respectively. Additionally, a contract extension on the Noble Roger Lewis resulted in a favorable dayrate change during 2014. This was partially offset by increased downtime on the Noble Scott Marks and the Noble David Tinsley. Furthermore, the Noble Lewis Dugger, which was sold in July 2013, was utilized during a portion of 2013.\nThe 6 percent increase in average dayrates on our semisubmersibles resulted in a $70 million increase in revenues from 2013. The increase in average dayrates was due to favorable dayrate changes on new contracts across the semisubmersible fleet, as well as the Noble Paul Romano returning to work during 2014. The 18 percent decline in operating days resulted in a $232 million decrease in revenues driven by contract completions on the Noble Paul Wolff, Noble Homer Ferrington and Noble Max Smith. Additionally, the Noble Amos Runner was in the shipyard undergoing regulatory inspections and maintenance during a portion of 2014 but operated during 2013.\nOperating Costs and Expenses. Contract drilling services operating costs and expenses increased $332 million for 2014 as compared to 2013. A significant portion of the increase was due to the crew-up and operating expenses for our newbuild rigs as they commenced, or prepared to commence, operating under contracts, which added approximately $322 million in expense in 2014. The remaining change was primarily driven by a $20 million increase in mobilization expense due to certain rig moves and the demobilization of certain rigs, partially offset by a $5 million decrease in operations support and rig-related expenses and a $5 million decrease in rig and operations support labor.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $111 million in 2014 over 2013, which is primarily attributable to newbuild rigs placed in service since the beginning of 2013 as noted above.\nLoss on impairment during 2014 related to a $685 million charge on our semisubmersibles, Noble Driller, Noble Jim Thompson and Noble Paul Wolff, which we decided not to actively market as a result of market conditions. Additionally, we fully impaired the $60 million of goodwill on our books in 2014, which originated from the acquisition of Frontier in 2010, as a result of a significant decline in the market value of our stock, coupled with a decrease in oil and gas prices, significant reductions in the projected dayrates for new contracts and reduced utilization forecasts. Loss on impairment during 2013 was related to our two cold stacked submersible rigs arising from the potential disposition of these assets to an unrelated third party. These submersible rigs were subsequently sold to an unrelated third party in January 2014 for a total sales price of $7 million.\nGain on disposal of assets during 2013 was attributable to the sale of the Noble Lewis Dugger to an unrelated third party in Mexico.\nGain on contract settlements/extinguishments during 2013 was attributable to the $45 million settlement of all claims against the former shareholders of Frontier, which we acquired in July 2010, relating to alleged breaches of various representations and warranties contained in the purchase agreement. A portion of the settlement, totaling approximately $14 million, was allocated to discontinued operations as it related to certain rigs spun-off as part of the Paragon Offshore transaction.\nOther Income and Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses. Overall, general and administrative expenses decreased $11 million in 2014 from 2013 primarily as a result of decreased legal and tax expenses related to ongoing projects.\nInterest Expense, net of amount capitalized. Interest expense, net of amount capitalized, increased $49 million in 2014 from 2013. The increase is a result of lower capitalized interest in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to the completion of construction on four of our newbuild drillships and four of our newbuild jackups, partially offset by the repayment of our $300 million fixed rate senior note in June 2013 and our $250 million fixed rate senior note in March 2014 using availability under our commercial paper program at lower interest rates. During 2014, we capitalized approximately 23 percent of total interest charges versus approximately 52 percent during 2013.\nIncome Tax Provision. Our income tax provision increased $15 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. Excluding the impact of the impairment charges recognized in 2014 and 2013 and the sale of the Noble Lewis Dugger in 2013, taxes increased $58 million driven by a higher worldwide effective tax rate and higher pre-tax income. A 34 percent increase in the worldwide effective tax rate during 2014 increased income tax expense by $36 million. The increase in the worldwide effective tax rate was a result of a change in the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings and the effect of the new UK tax law, which became effective retroactively to April 1, 2014, offset by favorable discrete items. Additionally, a 28 percent increase in pre-tax earnings generated a $22 million increase in income tax expense.\nDiscontinued Operations. Net income from discontinued operations for 2014 was $161 million as compared to $304 million for 2013. Revenues reported within discontinued operations were $1.0 billion during 2014 as compared to $1.7 billion for 2013. Operating income included within discontinued operations was $220 million during 2014 and $381 million for 2013. The variance is attributable to seven months of operations in 2014 versus a full year of operations in 2013, coupled with a $45 million increase in non-recurring Spin-off costs during 2014.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nCash flows from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are combined with cash flows from continuing operations within each cash flow statement category on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Net cash from operating activities in 2015 was $1.8 billion, which compared to $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively. We had working capital of $377 million and $260 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2015 was $433 million, which compared to $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The variance primarily relates to lower capital expenditures related to our newbuild expenditures as projects were completed in prior years, coupled with expenditures for rigs spun-off with Paragon Offshore in 2014 and 2013.\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2015 was $886 million, which compared to net cash provided from financing activities of $285 million and $615 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2015, our primary uses of cash included the repayment of our $350 million 3.45% Senior Notes in August 2015, coupled with shareholder dividend payments of approximately $316 million, the repurchase of 6.2 million shares in 2015 for $101 million and dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of approximately $72 million. Our total debt as a percentage of total debt plus equity decreased to 38 percent at December 31, 2015, down from 40 percent at December 31, 2014 as a result of the repayment of certain maturing notes during 2015. Although we issued $1.1 billion of Senior Notes in March 2015, this amount was substantially offset by a net reduction in indebtedness outstanding on our Credit Facilities and commercial paper program during 2015 as a result of the application of proceeds from the Senior Notes offering.\nOur principal source of capital in 2015 was cash generated from operating activities coupled with the $1.1 billion Senior Notes offering in March 2015. Cash generated during 2015 was primarily used to repay indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Facilities and commercial paper program, pay normal recurring operating expenses and repay our $350 million 3.45% Senior Notes.\nOur currently anticipated cash flow needs, both in the short-term and long-term, may include the following:\n \u00b7 normal recurring operating expenses; \n \u00b7 committed and discretionary capital expenditures; \n \u00b7 repayment of debt; and \n \u00b7 payments of dividends. \nWe currently expect to fund these cash flow needs with cash generated by our operations, cash on hand, borrowings under our existing credit facility, potential issuances of long-term debt, or asset sales. However, to adequately cover our expected cash flow needs, we may require capital in excess of the amount available from these sources, and we may seek additional sources of liquidity and/or delay or cancel certain discretionary capital expenditures or other payments as necessary.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had a total contract drilling services backlog of approximately $6.9 billion. Our backlog as of December 31, 2015 includes a commitment of 68 percent of available days for 2016. See Contract Drilling Services Backlog\u201d for additional information regarding our backlog.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures, including capitalized interest, totaled $423 million, $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Capital expenditures during 2015 consisted of the following:\n \u00b7 $345 million for sustaining capital, major projects, subsea related expenditures and upgrades and replacements to drilling equipment; \n \u00b7 $53 million in newbuild expenditures, including costs for the Noble Lloyd Noble and trailing costs on our recently completed newbuilds; and \n \u00b7 $25 million in capitalized interest. \nOur total capital expenditure budget for 2016 is approximately $800 million, which is currently anticipated to be spent as follows:\n \u00b7 approximately $461 million in newbuild expenditures; and \n \u00b7 $339 million for sustaining capital, major projects, subsea related expenditures and upgrades and replacements to drilling equipment, including capitalized interest that may fluctuate as a result of the timing of completion of ongoing projects. \nIn connection with our capital expenditure program, we have entered into certain commitments, including shipyard and purchase commitments, for approximately $598 million at December 31, 2015, all of which we expect to spend in 2016.\nFrom time to time we consider possible projects that would require expenditures that are not included in our capital budget, and such unbudgeted expenditures could be significant. In addition, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of drilling units from time to time. Other factors that could cause actual capital expenditures to materially exceed plan include delays and cost overruns in shipyards (including costs attributable to labor shortages), shortages of equipment, latent damage or deterioration to hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions, changes in governmental regulations and requirements and changes in design criteria or specifications during repair or construction.\nDividends\nOur most recent quarterly dividend payment to shareholders, totaling approximately $38 million (or $0.15 per share), was declared on January 29, 2016 and paid on February 16, 2016 to holders of record on February 8, 2016.\nThe declaration and payment of dividends require authorization of the Board of Directors of Noble-UK and such dividends on issued share capital may be paid only out of Noble-UK's distributable reserves\u201d on its statutory balance sheet. Noble-UK is not permitted to pay dividends out of share capital, which includes share premiums. As of December 31, 2015 Noble's distributable reserves are $1.8 billion. The payment of future dividends will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future business prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nShare Repurchases\nUnder UK law, the Company is only permitted to purchase its own shares by way of an off-market purchase\u201d in a plan approved by shareholders. In December 2014, we received shareholder approval to repurchase up to 37 million ordinary shares, or approximately 15 percent of our outstanding ordinary shares at the time of the shareholder approval. The authority to make such repurchases will expire at the end of the Company's 2016 annual general meeting of shareholders. At this time, we do not expect to seek shareholder approval for further repurchases at our 2016 annual general meeting.\nIn January 2015, we repurchased 6.2 million of our ordinary shares at an average price of $16.10 per share, excluding commissions and stamp tax. Including these items, the average price paid per share during January 2015 was $16.21.\nShare repurchases for each of the three years ended December 31 are as follows:\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Number\nof Shares\nPurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Cost (1) (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average\nPrice Paid\nper Share (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,209,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,769,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 154,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 190,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) The total cost and average price paid per share includes the impact of commissions and stamp tax for share repurchases made in the open market. \nCredit Facilities and Senior Unsecured Notes\nCredit Facilities and Commercial Paper Program\nAt December 31, 2015, we had two credit facilities with an aggregate maximum capacity of $2.7 billion, which are comprised of a five year $2.4 billion senior unsecured credit facility that matures in January 2020 and a $225 million 364-day senior unsecured credit facility that matured in January 2016 and was not renewed (together, the Credit Facilities\u201d).\nWe have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.4 billion in unsecured commercial paper notes. Amounts issued under the commercial paper program are supported by the unused capacity under our credit facility and, therefore, are classified as long-term on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The outstanding amounts of commercial paper reduce availability under our credit facility.\nAs of February 12, 2016, we had no amounts drawn on our credit facility and no commercial paper issued.\nOur credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to $500 million in letters of credit. The issuance of letters of credit under the facility reduces the amount available for borrowing. At February 12, 2016, we had no letters of credit issued under the facility.\nAccess to our commercial paper program is dependent upon our credit ratings. A decline in our credit ratings below investment grade would prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market. If we were unable to access the commercial paper market, we would transfer any outstanding borrowings to our credit facility. Our credit facility has interest rates that are generally higher than those found in the commercial paper market, which would result in increased interest expense in the future.\nIn addition, our credit facility and certain of our senior unsecured notes, as discussed below, have provisions which vary the applicable interest rates based upon our credit ratings. If our credit ratings were to decline, the interest expense under our Credit Facilities and certain of our senior unsecured notes would increase.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOur total debt related to senior unsecured notes was $4.5 billion at December 31, 2015 as compared to $3.7 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase in senior unsecured notes outstanding is a result of the issuance of $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes in March 2015, which we issued through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Noble Holding International Limited ( NHIL\u201d). These Senior Notes were issued in three separate tranches, consisting of $250 million of 4.00% Senior Notes due 2018, $450 million of 5.95% Senior Notes due 2025 and $400 million of 6.95% Senior Notes due 2045. The weighted average coupon of all three tranches is 5.87%. The interest rate on these Senior Notes may be increased if the credit rating applicable to the notes is downgraded below investment grade (up to a maximum of 200 basis points). The net proceeds of approximately $1.08 billion, after expenses, were used to repay indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Facilities and commercial paper program.\nIn August 2015, we repaid our $350 million 3.45% Senior Notes using cash on hand.\nOur $300 million 3.05% Senior Notes matured during the first quarter of 2016. We anticipate using cash on hand to repay the outstanding balances.\nCovenants\nThe Credit Facilities and commercial paper program are guaranteed by our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries, Noble Holding International Limited ( NHIL\u201d) and Noble Holding Corporation ( NHC\u201d). The covenants and events of default under the two Credit\nFacilities are substantially similar, and each facility contains a covenant that limits our ratio of debt to total tangible capitalization, as defined in the Credit Facilities, to 0.60. At December 31, 2015, our ratio of debt to total tangible capitalization was approximately 0.38. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2015.\nIn addition to the covenants from the Credit Facilities noted above, the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes contain covenants that place restrictions on certain merger and consolidation transactions, unless we are the surviving entity or the other party assumes the obligations under the indenture, and on the ability to sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, there are restrictions on incurring or assuming certain liens and on entering into sale and lease-back transactions. At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. We continually monitor compliance with the covenants under our notes and expect to remain in compliance during 2016.\nOther\nAt December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit of $5 million, including bonds covering the temporary importation of equipment, performance bonds and expatriate visa guarantees.\nSummary of Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our

to external vendors primarily related to future capital purchases. \n (2) Tax reserves are included in Other\u201d due to the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements to taxing authorities. See Note 14 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. \nAt December 31, 2015, we had other commitments that we are contractually obligated to fulfill with cash if the obligations are called. These obligations include letters of credit that guarantee our performance as it relates to our drilling contracts, tax and other obligations in various jurisdictions. These letters of credit obligations are not normally called, as we typically comply with the underlying performance requirement.\nThe following table summarizes our other commercial commitments at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Cash Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Letters of Credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total commercial commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. Critical accounting policies and estimates that most significantly impact our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts, those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities in which we hold a controlling financial interest. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of two joint ventures, in each of which\nwe own a 50 percent interest. Our ownership interest meets the definition of variable interest under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) codification and we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe combined joint venture carrying amount of the Bully-class drillships at December 31, 2015 totaled $1.4 billion, which was primarily funded through partner equity contributions. Operating revenues were $334 million, $372 million and $355 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net income totaled $154 million, $157 million and $145 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost, reduced by provisions to recognize economic impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $761 million and $970 million of construction-in-progress, respectively. Such amounts are included in Property and equipment, at cost\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are sold, retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the gain or loss is recognized. Drilling equipment and facilities are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as of the date placed in service or date of major refurbishment. Estimated useful lives of our drilling equipment range from three to thirty years. Other property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over useful lives ranging from two to forty years.\nDuring 2015, we sold for parts the previously retired semisubmersible rigs, the Noble Paul Wolff, the Noble Driller and the Noble Jim Thompson. In connection with the sale of these rigs, we received proceeds of approximately $5 million.\nInterest is capitalized on construction-in-progress using the weighted average cost of debt outstanding during the period of construction. Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $25 million, $47 million and $115 million, respectively.\nScheduled maintenance of equipment is performed based on the number of hours operated in accordance with our preventative maintenance program. Routine repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred; however, the costs of the overhauls and asset replacement projects that benefit future periods and which typically occur every three to five years are capitalized when incurred and depreciated over an equivalent period. These overhauls and asset replacement projects are included in Property and equipment, at cost\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts, net of accumulated depreciation, totaled $202 million and $179 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Depreciation expense from continuing operations related to overhauls and asset replacement totaled $75 million, $77 million and $70 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe evaluate the impairment of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, on an annual basis, we complete an impairment analysis on our rig fleet. An impairment loss on our property and equipment exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset's carrying value over the estimated fair value. As part of this analysis, we make assumptions and estimates regarding future market conditions. To the extent actual results do not meet our estimated assumptions, for a given rig class, we may take an impairment loss in the future.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, in connection with our annual impairment analysis, we decided that we would no longer market one of our drillships, the Noble Discoverer. The decision was a result of the termination of the contract for this rig by Shell in December 2015 and the decreased opportunities for rigs of this type in the current marketplace. We also reviewed assumptions on the future marketability of one of our jackups, the Noble Charles Copeland, after its contract completion in late September 2015, with consideration given to its years in service, limited technical features and anticipated capital requirements in light of the current market conditions. As a result of this analysis, we have decided to discontinue marketing this unit. Additionally, as a result of a fourth quarter review of capital spare equipment, we elected to retire certain capital spare equipment. In connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, we evaluated these units and certain capital spare equipment for impairment and recorded an impairment charge of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAlso in 2015, we determined that certain corporate assets were partially impaired due to a declining market for, and the potential disposal of, the assets. We estimated the fair value of the assets based on quotes from brokers of similar assets (Level 2). Based on these estimates, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring 2014, we recorded a $685 million impairment charge on three of our semisubmersibles, the Noble Driller, the Noble Jim Thompson and the Noble Paul Wolff, which we decided to no longer actively market as a result of the declining market conditions.\nDuring 2012, we recorded a $13 million impairment charge on our submersible fleet, primarily as a result of the declining market outlook for drilling services for that rig type. During 2013, we recorded an additional impairment charge of approximately $4 million on our two cold stacked submersible rigs arising from the potential disposition of these assets to an unrelated third party. In January 2014, we completed the sale of the submersibles for a total sales price of $7 million.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur typical dayrate drilling contracts require our performance of a variety of services for a specified period of time. We determine progress towards completion of the contract by measuring efforts expended and the cost of services required to perform under a drilling contract, as the basis for our revenue recognition. Revenues generated from our dayrate-basis drilling contracts and labor contracts are recognized on a per day basis as services are performed and begin upon the contract commencement, as defined under the specified drilling or labor contract. Dayrate revenues are typically earned, and contract drilling expenses are typically incurred ratably over the term of our drilling contracts. We review and monitor our performance under our drilling contracts to confirm the basis for our revenue recognition. Revenues from bonuses are recognized when earned, and when collectability is reasonably assured.\nIn our dayrate drilling contracts, we typically receive compensation and incur costs for mobilization, equipment modification or other activities prior to the commencement of a contract. Any such compensation may be paid through a lump-sum payment or other daily compensation. Pre-contract compensation and costs are deferred until the contract commences. The deferred pre-contract compensation and costs are amortized into income, using the straight-line method, over the term of the initial contract period, regardless of the activity taking place. This approach is consistent with the economics for which the parties have contracted. Once a contract commences, we may conduct various activities, including drilling and well bore related activities, rig maintenance and equipment installation, movement between well locations or other activities.\nDeferred revenues from drilling contracts totaled $180 million and $263 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Such amounts are included in either Other current liabilities\u201d or Other liabilities\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based upon our expected time of recognition. Related expenses deferred under drilling contracts totaled $78 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to $94 million at December 31, 2014, and are included in either Prepaid expenses and other current assets\u201d or Other assets\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based upon our expected time of recognition.\nIn April 2015, we agreed to contract dayrate reductions for five rigs working for Saudi Aramco, which were effective from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. However, given current market conditions and based on discussions with the customer, we do not expect the rates to return to the original contract rates. In accordance with accounting guidance, we are recognizing the reductions on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the existing Saudi Aramco contracts. At December 31, 2015, revenues recorded in excess of billings as a result of this recognition totaled $53 million, and are included in either Prepaid expenses and other current assets\u201d or Other assets\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based upon our expected time of recognition.\nWe record reimbursements from customers for out-of-pocket\u201d expenses as revenues and the related direct cost as operating expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nWe operate in a number of countries throughout the world and our tax returns filed in those jurisdictions are subject to review and examination by tax authorities within those jurisdictions. We recognize uncertain tax positions that we believe have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained. We cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any existing or future assessments.\nDuring 2014, the IRS began its examination of our tax reporting in the U.S. for the taxable years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011. We believe that we have accurately reported all amounts in our 2010 and 2011 tax returns. We believe the ultimate resolution of the IRS examination will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nUnder the tax sharing agreement ( TSA\u201d) entered into at the time of the Spin-off, Noble and Paragon Offshore are each responsible for the taxes that relate to their respective business and provide a corresponding indemnity. In addition, in February 2016, we entered into an agreement in principle with Paragon Offshore (the Agreement in Principle\u201d) relating to tax matters in Mexico described below in exchange for a full and unconditional release of any claims by Paragon Offshore in connection with the Spin-off (including any claims that could be brought on behalf of its creditors).\nAudit claims of approximately $174 million attributable to income and other business taxes have been assessed against us in Mexico, as detailed below. Under our Agreement in Principle, we agreed to assume the administration of Paragon Offshore's Mexican income and value-added taxes for the years 2005 through 2010 and for Paragon Offshore's Mexican customs taxes through\n2010, as well as the related bonding obligations and certain of the tax related liabilities. In addition, under the Agreement in Principle, we would (i) pay all of the ultimate resolved amount of Mexican income and value-added taxes related to Paragon Offshore's business that were incurred through a Noble-retained entity, (ii) pay 50 percent of the ultimate resolved amount of Mexican income and value-added taxes related to Paragon Offshore's business that were incurred through a Paragon Offshore-retained entity, (iii) pay 50 percent of the ultimate resolved amount of Mexican custom taxes related to Paragon Offshore's business, and (iv) be required to post any tax appeal bond that may be required to challenge a final assessment. Tax assessments of approximately $50 million for income and value-added taxes have been made against Noble entities in Mexico. Tax assessments for income and value-added taxes of approximately $202 million have been made against Paragon Offshore entities in Mexico, of which approximately $46 million relates to Noble's business that operated through Paragon Offshore-retained entities in Mexico prior to the Spin-off. We will only be obligated to post a tax appeal bond in the event a final assessment is made by Mexican authorities. As of February 12, 2016, there have only been $3 million in final assessments that have been bonded.\nIn January, 2015, Noble received an official notification of a ruling from the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court in Mexico. The ruling settled an ongoing dispute in Mexico relating to the classification of a Noble subsidiary's business activity and the applicable rate of depreciation under the Mexican law applicable to the activities of that subsidiary. The ruling did not result in any additional tax liability to Noble. Additionally, the ruling is only applicable to the Noble subsidiary named in the ruling and, therefore, does not establish the depreciation rate applicable to the assets of other Noble subsidiaries. Under the Agreement in Principle, we would be responsible for any tax liability ultimately incurred because these depreciation liabilities would be incurred by Noble-retained entities, and such amounts are reflected in the discussion of Mexican audit claims in the preceding paragraph. We will continue to contest future assessments received, and do not believe we are liable for additional tax.\nParagon Offshore has received tax assessments of approximately $122 million attributable to income, customs and other business taxes in Brazil, of which $38 million relates to Noble's business that operated through a Paragon Offshore-retained entity in Brazil prior to the Spin-off. Under the TSA, we must indemnify Paragon Offshore for all assessed amounts that are related to Noble's Brazil business, approximately $38 million, if and when such payments become due.\nWe have contested, or intend to contest or cooperate with Paragon Offshore in Brazil where it is contesting, the assessments described above, including through litigation if necessary, and we believe the ultimate resolution, for which we have not made any accrual, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Tax authorities may issue additional assessments or pursue legal actions as a result of tax audits and we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of such assessments and legal actions or our ability to collect indemnities from Paragon Offshore under the TSA or the Agreement in Principle.\nWe have been notified by Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. ( Petrobras\u201d) that it is currently challenging assessments by Brazilian tax authorities of withholding taxes associated with the provision of drilling rigs for its operations in Brazil during 2008 and 2009. Petrobras has also notified us that if Petrobras must ultimately pay such withholding taxes, it will seek reimbursement from us for the portion allocable to our drilling rigs. The amount of withholding tax that Petrobras indicates may be allocable to Noble drilling rigs is R$79 million (approximately $20 million). We believe that our contract with Petrobras requires Petrobras to indemnify us for these withholding taxes. We will, if necessary, vigorously defend our rights.\nIn certain circumstances, we expect that, due to changing demands of the offshore drilling markets and the ability to redeploy our offshore drilling units, certain units will not reside in a location long enough to give rise to future tax consequences. As a result, no deferred tax asset or liability has been recognized in these circumstances. Should our expectations change regarding the length of time an offshore drilling unit will be used in a given location, we will adjust deferred taxes accordingly.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe maintain various levels of self-insured retention for certain losses including property damage, loss of hire, employment practices liability, employers' liability and general liability, among others. We accrue for property damage and loss of hire charges on a per event basis.\nEmployment practices liability claims are accrued based on actual claims during the year. Maritime employer's liability claims are generally estimated using actuarial determinations. General liability claims are estimated by our internal claims department by evaluating the facts and circumstances of each claim (including incurred but not reported claims) and making estimates based upon historical experience with similar claims. At both December 31, 2015 and 2014, loss reserves for personal injury and protection claims totaled $21 million, and such amounts are included in Other current liabilities\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCertain Significant Estimates and Contingent Liabilities\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. In addition, we are involved in several litigation matters, some of which could lead to potential liability to us. We follow FASB standards regarding contingent liabilities which are discussed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18-Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-08, which amends FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 205, Presentation of Financial Statements\u201d and ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment.\u201d This ASU alters the definition of a discontinued operation to cover only asset disposals that are a strategic shift with a major effect on an entity's operations and finances, and calls for more extensive disclosures about a discontinued operation's assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The guidance is effective for all disposals, or classifications as held-for-sale, of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. This standard was not early adopted in connection with the Spin-off. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, which creates ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition,\u201d including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. In addition, ASU 2014-09 supersedes the cost guidance in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts,\u201d and creates new Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs-Contracts with Customers.\u201d In summary, the core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. Companies are allowed to select between two transition methods: (1) a full retrospective transition method with the application of the new guidance to each prior reporting period presented, or (2) a retrospective transition method that recognizes the cumulative effect on prior periods at the date of adoption together with additional footnote disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early application is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and have not made any decision on the method of adoption.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation.\u201d The guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition and should not be reflected in the estimate of the grant-date fair value of the award. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The guidance can be applied prospectively for all awards granted or modified after the effective date or retrospectively to all awards with performance targets outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, which amends ASC Subtopic 205-40, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to continue as a Going Concern.\u201d The amendments in this ASU provide guidance related to management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, which amends ASC Subtopic 225-20, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items.\u201d The amendment in this ASU eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. The amendments in this\nupdate are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, which amends ASC Subtopic 810, Consolidations.\u201d This amendment affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, the amendments modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities; eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The standard may be applied retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, which amends ASC Subtopic 835-30, Interest - Imputation of Interest.\u201d The guidance requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the associated debt liability. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The new guidance will be applied on a retrospective basis. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15 which amends ASC Subtopic 835-30, Interest - Imputation of Interest.\u201d The guidance allows a debt issuance cost related to a line-of-credit to be presented in the balance sheet as an asset and subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the line-of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-04, which amends ASC Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits.\u201d The guidance gives an employer whose fiscal year end does not coincide with a calendar month end the ability, as a practical expedient, to measure defined benefit retirement obligations and related plan assets as of the month end that is closest to its fiscal year end. The ASU also provides a similar practical expedient for interim remeasurements of significant events. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-12, which amends ASC Topic 960, Plan Accounting-Defined Benefit Pension Plans,\u201d ASC Topic 962, Defined Contribution Pension Plans\u201d and ASC Topic 965, Health and Welfare Benefit Plans.\u201d There are three parts to the ASU that aim to simplify the accounting and presentation of plan accounting. Part I of this ASU requires fully benefit-responsive investment contracts to be measured at contract value instead of the current fair value measurement. Part II of this ASU requires investments (both participant-directed and nonparticipant-directed investments) of employee benefit plans be grouped only by general type, eliminating the need to disaggregate the investments in multiple ways. Part III of this ASU provides a similar measurement date practical expedient for employee benefit plans as available in ASU No. 2015-04, which allows employers to measure defined benefit plan assets on a month-end date that is nearest to the year's fiscal year-end when the fiscal period does not coincide with a month-end. Parts I and II of the new guidance should be applied on a retrospective basis. Part III of the new guidance should be applied on a prospective basis. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, which amends Topic 805, Business Combinations.\u201d This amendment eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, and revise comparative information for prior periods presented in financial statements. Those adjustments are required when new information about circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date would have affected the measurement of the amount initially recognized. This update requires an entity to recognize these adjustments in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. An acquirer must record the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. An entity must present separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment had been recognized as of the acquisition date. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, which amends ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.\u201d This amendment aligns the presentation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities with International Financial Reporting Standards. International Accounting Standard 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets be offset and presented as\na single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments in this update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_text": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and our results of operations for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed by Noble-UK and Noble-Cayman.\nThe results of operations for Paragon Offshore prior to August 1, 2014, the Spin-off date, and non-recurring costs related to the Spin-off have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report. The terms earnings\u201d and loss\u201d as used in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d refer to income/(loss) from continuing operations. Income/(loss) from continuing operations is representative of the Company's current business operations and focus.\nExecutive Overview\nOur 2015 financial and operating results from continuing operations include:\n \u00b7 operating revenues totaling $3.4 billion; \n \u00b7 net income of $511 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, which includes a $418 million after-tax impairment charge recognized on two of our rigs, certain capital spare equipment and certain corporate assets; \n \u00b7 net cash from operating activities totaling $1.8 billion; and \n \u00b7 a decrease in debt to 38 percent of total capitalization at the end of 2015, down from 40 percent at the end of 2014 as a result of the repayment of certain maturing notes during the current year. \nThe business environment for offshore drillers during 2015 remained challenging. The rig capacity imbalance, caused in part by the addition of newbuild units and rigs completing current contracts, increased while customer demand for these rigs has decreased. Beginning in June 2014, the price of oil, a key factor in determining customer activity levels, began to decline rapidly, with the Brent crude price declining from approximately $112 per barrel on June 30, 2014 to approximately $37 per barrel on December 31, 2015. In this environment, operators have curtailed drilling programs, especially exploration activity, resulting in a dramatic reduction in dayrates for new contracts, as well as lower rig utilization. While there have been a number of rig retirements in 2015 and early 2016, the rig capacity imbalance has not corrected.\nWe expect that the business environment for 2016 will remain challenging and could potentially deteriorate further. The present level of global economic activity, the potential increase of oil supply from Iran and a lack of production cuts within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are contributing to an uncertain oil price environment, leading to a persistent disruption in our customers' exploration and production spending plans. Capital expenditures undertaken by the offshore drilling industry in recent years have increased the supply of drilling rigs and current and expected demand from customers during 2016 is not expected to support this current supply. We cannot give any assurances as to when these conditions in the offshore drilling market will improve, or when there will be higher demand for contract drilling services or a decline in the supply of available drilling rigs. While current market conditions persist, we will continue to focus on operating efficiency, cost control and operating margin preservation, which could include the stacking or retirement of additional drilling rigs.\nWe believe in the long-term fundamentals for the industry, especially for those contractors with a modern fleet of high-specification rigs like ours. Also, we believe the ultimate market recovery will benefit from any sustained under-investment by customers during this current market phase.\nOur business strategy focuses on deepwater drilling and high-specification jackups and the deployment of our drilling rigs in important oil and gas basins around the world.\nWe have expanded our offshore deepwater drilling and high-specification jackup capabilities through the construction of rigs. Currently, we have one newbuild project remaining, the heavy-duty, harsh environment jackup, Noble Lloyd Noble, which is scheduled to commence operations under a four-year contract in the North Sea during the third quarter of 2016. Although we plan to focus on capital preservation and liquidity because of current market conditions, we also plan to continue to evaluate opportunities as they arise from time to time to enhance our fleet, particularly focusing on higher specification rigs, to execute the increasingly more complex drilling programs required by our customers.\nWhile we cannot predict the future level of demand or dayrates for our services, or future conditions in the offshore contract drilling industry, we believe we are strategically well positioned.\nImpairment\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, in connection with our annual impairment analysis, we decided that we would no longer market one of our drillships, the Noble Discoverer. The decision was a result of the termination of the contract for this rig by Shell in December 2015 and the decreased opportunities for rigs of this type in the current marketplace. We also reviewed assumptions on the future marketability of one of our jackups, the Noble Charles Copeland, after its contract completion in late September 2015, with consideration given to its years in service, limited technical features and anticipated capital requirements in light of the current market conditions. As a result of this analysis, we have decided to discontinue marketing this unit. Additionally, as a result of a fourth quarter review of capital spare equipment, we elected to retire certain capital spare equipment. As a result of our analysis discussed above, we recorded an impairment charge of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAlso in 2015, we determined that certain corporate assets were partially impaired due to a declining market for, and the potential disposal of, the assets. We estimated the fair value of the assets based on quotes from brokers of similar assets (Level 2). Based on these estimates, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we decided to discontinue marketing three of our semisubmersibles, the Noble Driller, the Noble Jim Thompson and the Noble Paul Wolff, as a result of the market conditions. We evaluated these units for impairments and recorded an impairment charge of $685 million on these units. Additionally, we fully impaired the $60 million of goodwill on our books, which originated from the acquisition of FDR Holdings Limited ( Frontier\u201d) in 2010, as a result of a significant decline in the market value of our stock, a decrease in oil and gas prices, significant reductions in the projected dayrates for new contracts and reduced utilization forecasts.\nWe evaluate the impairment of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, on an annual basis, we complete an impairment analysis on our rig fleet. An impairment loss on our property and equipment exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset's carrying value over the estimated fair value. As part of this analysis, we make assumptions and estimates regarding future market conditions. To the extent actual results do not meet our estimated assumptions, for a given rig class, we may take an impairment loss in the future.\nSpin-off of Paragon Offshore plc\nOn August 1, 2014, Noble-UK completed the separation and spin-off of a majority of its standard specification offshore drilling business through a pro rata distribution of all of the ordinary shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Paragon Offshore, to the holders of Noble's ordinary shares. Our shareholders received one share of Paragon Offshore for every three shares of Noble owned as of July 23, 2014, the record date for the distribution. Through the Spin-off, we disposed of most of our standard specification drilling units and related assets, liabilities and business. Prior to the Spin-off, Paragon Offshore issued approximately $1.7 billion of long-term debt. We used the proceeds from this debt to repay certain amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. The results of operations for Paragon Offshore prior to the Spin-off date and incremental Spin-off related costs have been classified as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. There were no discontinued operations in 2015.\nIn February 2016, we entered into an agreement in principle for a settlement with Paragon Offshore under which, in exchange for a full and unconditional release of any claims by Paragon Offshore in connection with the Spin-off (including certain claims that could be brought on behalf of Paragon Offshore's creditors), we agreed to assume the administration of Mexican tax claims for specified years up to and including 2010, as well as the related bonding obligations and certain of the related tax liabilities. The agreement is subject to approval of the bankruptcy court following Paragon Offshore's filing of a pre-negotiated bankruptcy plan. For additional information regarding the Spin-off, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2-Spin-off of Paragon Offshore plc\u201d and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18-Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nPrior to the completion of the Spin-off, Noble and Paragon Offshore entered into a series of agreements to effect the separation and Spin-off and govern the relationship between the parties after the Spin-off.\nMaster Separation Agreement ( MSA\u201d)\nThe general terms and conditions relating to the separation and Spin-off are set forth in the MSA. The MSA identifies the assets transferred, liabilities assumed and contracts assigned either to Paragon Offshore by us or by Paragon Offshore to us in the separation and describes when and how these transfers, assumptions and assignments would occur. The MSA provides for, among other things, Paragon Offshore's responsibility for liabilities relating to its business and the responsibility of Noble for liabilities related to our, and in certain limited cases, Paragon Offshore's business, in each case irrespective of when the liability arose. The MSA also contains indemnification obligations and ongoing commitments by us and Paragon Offshore.\nEmployee Matters Agreement ( EMA\u201d)\nThe EMA allocates liabilities and responsibilities between us and Paragon Offshore relating to employment, compensation and benefits and other employment related matters.\nTax Sharing Agreement\nThe tax sharing agreement provides for the allocation of tax liabilities and benefits between us and Paragon Offshore and governs the parties' assistance with tax-related claims.\nTransition Services Agreements\nUnder two transition services agreements, we agreed to continue, for a limited period of time, to provide various interim support services to Paragon Offshore, and Paragon Offshore agreed to provide various interim support services to us, including providing operational and administrative support for our remaining Brazilian operations.\nContract Drilling Services Backlog\nWe maintain a backlog (as defined below) of commitments for contract drilling services. The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2015, the amount of our contract drilling services backlog and the percent of available operating days committed for the periods indicated:\n\n \n (1) The drilling contracts with Royal Dutch Shell plc ( Shell\u201d) for the Noble Globetrotter I, Noble Globetrotter II and Noble Don Taylor provide opportunities for us to earn performance bonuses based on key performance indicators as defined by the contracts. With respect to these contracts, we have reduced the percentage of the potential performance bonuses for these rigs to zero reflecting a net reduction to our backlog of approximately $101 million reflecting the current environment in which the payment of bonuses is less likely. \n (2) Some of our drilling contracts provide the customer with certain early termination rights and, in very limited cases, these termination rights require minimal or no notice and financial penalties. However, we have not received any notification of contract cancellations as of February 12, 2016, aside from the Noble Discoverer which has been reflected in this report and for which we received a termination payment of $133.5 million during 2015. \nOur Saudi Aramco contract rates were adjusted downward for 2015 for purposes of the backlog. Backlog for the remaining four contracts previously reflected the original, pre-adjustment contract rates. However, given current market conditions and based on discussions with the customer, we do not expect the rates to return to the original contract rates. Instead, we expect the contract rates to be in the general range of the amended rates for 2015 through the end of each respective contract, which would reduce the backlog for those rigs by approximately $253 million or potentially by a greater amount should negotiations lead to a lower dayrate. Backlog for these contracts has now been prepared assuming the reduced rates for 2015 apply for the remainder of the contract.\n (3) Three of our long-term contracts with Shell, the Noble Globetrotter I, Noble Globetrotter II and Noble Bully II, contain dayrate adjustment clauses after the initial five-year contract term. After the initial five-year term, dayrates adjust up or down every six months based on a discount to a market basket of comparable dayrates, all as defined in the contracts. These contracts commence indexing in April 2017, July 2017 and September 2018 for the Noble Bully II, Noble Globetrotter I and Noble Globetrotter II, respectively. There can be no assurance regarding the level of future dayrates under these market-indexed contracts. For every $50,000 change in dayrate under each of these contracts, backlog would be adjusted by $275 million in the aggregate. The backlog shown herein assumes the initial dayrate continues for the entirety of the contract because of the lack of relevant available market data. Should the current adverse market conditions persist into 2017, 2018 or beyond, we would expect a material reduction to dayrates as compared to the initial five-year term rate. \n (4) The drilling contracts for the Noble Sam Croft and Noble Tom Madden remain under contract with Freeport-McMoRan Inc. ( Freeport\u201d) into July 2017 and November 2017, respectively. Freeport has announced plans to reduce the number of rigs it utilizes in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We are currently in discussion with Freeport regarding these contracts to determine whether there is a mutually beneficial arrangement that appropriately addresses the interests of each party. The ultimate impact to backlog from these discussions is uncertain. The amount of backlog attributable to the Freeport contracts is currently $795 million or 12 percent of total backlog. \n (5) Percent of available days committed is calculated by dividing the total number of days our rigs are operating under contract for such period, or committed days, by the product of the total number of our rigs, including cold stacked rigs, and the number of calendar days in such period. Committed days do not include the days that a rig is stacked or the days that a rig is expected to be out of service for significant overhaul, repairs or maintenance. Percentages take into account additional capacity from the estimated dates of deployment of our newbuild rigs that are scheduled to commence operations during 2016. \n (6) Noble and a subsidiary of Shell are involved in joint ventures that own and operate both the Noble Bully I and the Noble Bully II. Under the terms of the joint venture agreements, each party has an equal 50 percent share in both rigs. As of December 31, 2015, the combined amount of backlog for these rigs totals approximately $1.3 billion, all of which is included in our backlog. Noble's proportional interest in the backlog for these rigs totals $632 million. \nOur contract drilling services backlog reflects estimated future revenues attributable to both signed drilling contracts and letters of intent that we expect to result in binding drilling contracts. A letter of intent is generally subject to customary conditions, including the execution of a definitive drilling contract. It is possible that some customers that have entered into letters of intent will not enter into signed drilling contracts. As of December 31, 2015, our contract drilling services backlog did not include any letters of intent.\nWe calculate backlog for any given unit and period by multiplying the full contractual operating dayrate for such unit by the number of days remaining in the period. The reported contract drilling services backlog does not include amounts representing revenues for mobilization, demobilization and contract preparation, which are not expected to be significant to our contract drilling services revenues, amounts constituting reimbursables from customers or amounts attributable to uncommitted option periods under drilling contracts or letters of intent.\nThe amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned may be materially different than the backlog amounts and backlog periods set forth in the table above due to various factors, including, but not limited to, shipyard and maintenance projects, unplanned downtime, the operation of market benchmarks for dayrate resets, achievement of bonuses, weather conditions, reduced standby or mobilization rates and other factors that result in applicable dayrates lower than the full contractual operating dayrate. In addition, amounts included in the backlog may change because drilling contracts may be varied or modified by mutual consent or customers may exercise early termination rights contained in some of our drilling contracts or decline to enter into a drilling contract after executing a letter of intent. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual operating results for the periods for which the backlog is calculated. Please read Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors-We can provide no assurance that our current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized.\u201d\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2015 Compared to 2014\nGeneral\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to Noble-UK for 2015 was $511 million, or $2.06 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.4 billion, compared to net loss from continuing operations for 2014 of $152 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.2 billion.\nAs a result of Noble-UK conducting all of its business through Noble-Cayman and its subsidiaries, the financial position and results of operations for Noble-Cayman, and the reasons for material changes in the amount of revenue and expense items between 2015 and 2014, would be the same as the information presented below regarding Noble-UK in all material respects, except operating income for Noble-Cayman for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $29 million and $50 million higher, respectively, than operating income for Noble-UK for the same periods. The operating income difference is primarily a result of executive costs directly attributable to Noble-UK for operations support and stewardship related services. In addition, we had non-recurring costs of $63 million in 2014 related to the Spin-off, which we recognized as part of discontinued operations at the Noble-UK level.\nRig Utilization, Operating Days and Average Dayrates\nOperating results from continuing operations for our contract drilling services segment are dependent on three primary metrics: rig utilization, operating days and dayrates. The following table sets forth the average rig utilization, operating days and average dayrates for our rig fleet for 2015 and 2014:\n\n \n (1) We define utilization for a specific period as the total number of days our rigs are operating under contract, divided by the product of the total number of our rigs, including cold stacked rigs, and the number of calendar days in such period. Information reflects our policy of reporting on the basis of the number of available rigs in our fleet, excluding newbuild rigs under construction. \n (2) Information reflects the number of days that our rigs were operating under contract. \n (3) Includes the contract drilling services revenue portion of the Noble Homer Ferrington arbitration award during the current year. Exclusive of the arbitration award, the average dayrate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $372,512. \n (4) Includes the contract drilling services revenue portion of the Noble Discoverer contraction cancellation with Shell during the current year. Exclusive of the cancellation agreement, the average dayrate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $502,878. \nContract Drilling Services\nThe following table sets forth the operating results from continuing operations for our contract drilling services segment for 2015 and 2014 (dollars in thousands):\n\n \n (1) We record reimbursements from customers for out-of-pocket expenses as operating revenues and the related direct costs as operating expenses. Changes in the amount of these reimbursables generally do not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n ** Not a meaningful percentage. \nOperating Revenues. Changes in contract drilling services revenues for the current year as compared to the prior year were driven by a 6 percent increase in average dayrates, partially offset by a 2 percent decrease in operating days. The 6 percent increase in average dayrates increased revenues by approximately $175 million, while the 2 percent decrease in operating days decreased revenues by $61 million.\nThe increase in contract drilling services revenues relates to our drillships which generated approximately $453 million more revenue in 2015. This amount was offset by decreases in revenues for our semisubmersibles and jackups, which declined by $330 million and $9 million, respectively, from the prior year.\nDuring the current year, we recognized $145 million of dayrate revenues related to the Noble Discoverer cancellation agreement with Shell. Excluding the cancellation agreement, drillship revenues increased by $308 million driven by an 18 percent increase in operating days and a 4 percent increase in average dayrates, resulting in a $242 million and a $66 million increase in revenues, respectively, from the prior year. The increase in both average dayrates and operating days was the result of a full year of operations from the Noble Sam Croft and the Noble Tom Madden, which commenced operations in July 2014 and November 2014, respectively.\nDuring the current year, we recognized $137 million of dayrate revenues related to the Noble Homer Ferrington arbitration award. Excluding the arbitration award, semisubmersible revenues decreased by $467 million driven by a 34 percent decline in operating days and a 9 percent decline in average dayrates, resulting in a $397 million and a $70 million decline in revenues, respectively, from the prior year. The decrease in both operating days and average dayrates was primarily attributable to the retirement of the Noble Jim Thompson, the Noble Driller and the Noble Paul Wolff as a result of our decision to retire these rigs based on the declining market conditions. Additionally, the Noble Max Smith was operational during the prior year but was off contract during the current year and the Noble Paul Romano was operational during the prior year but was off contract for a significant portion of the current year. This was partially offset by the Noble Amos Runner, which operated during the current year but was in the shipyard undergoing regulatory inspections and maintenance during a portion of the prior year.\nThe decrease in jackup revenues was driven by an 8 percent decrease in average dayrates, which resulted in a $59 million decrease in revenues driven by unfavorable dayrate changes on contracts across the jackup fleet. This was partially offset by an 8 percent increase in operating days, which resulted in a $50 million increase in revenues from the prior year. The increase in operating days was the result of a full year of revenue from the Noble Houston Colbert and the Noble Sam Turner, which began operations in March 2014 and August 2014, respectively, coupled with the commencement of the Noble Tom Prosser during October 2015. Additionally, the Noble David Tinsley experienced full utilization in the current year but was off contract for a majority of the prior year. This was partially offset by the Noble Mick O'Brien, which was available during the current year but was under contract for a substantial portion of 2014.\nOperating Costs and Expenses. Contract drilling services operating costs and expenses decreased $268 million for the current year as compared to the prior year. This was due to decreased costs of $117 million related to the retirement of the Noble Jim Thompson, the Noble Driller and the Noble Paul Wolff and $83 million related to idle or stacked rigs. This was partially offset by crew-up and operating expenses for our newbuild rigs as they commenced, or prepared to commence, operating under contracts, which added approximately $118 million in expense in the current year. Excluding these factors, contract drilling services costs decreased by $186 million. This decrease was driven by a $41 million decrease in labor costs due to the termination of retention bonuses and decreases in certain non-contractual crew positions, a $40 million decrease in mobilization and transportation expenses related to certain rig moves during the prior year, a $32 million decrease in repair and maintenance costs, a $24 million decrease in operations support costs, a $16 million decrease in other rig-related expenses, an $11 million decrease in insurance costs related to our policy renewal in March 2015, a $12 million decrease in fuel and travel rotational expenses and a $10 million decrease for the reimbursement of costs and fees related to the Noble Homer Ferrington arbitration award during the current year that were previously recognized through contract drilling services operating costs and expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $3 million in 2015 over 2014, which is primarily attributable to newbuild rigs placed in service partially offset by the retirement of the three semisubmersible rigs discussed above.\nLoss on impairment during the current year of $406 million relates to the Noble Discoverer and the Noble Charles Copeland, which we elected to discontinue marketing due to current market conditions. Additionally, as a result of a fourth quarter review of capital spare equipment, we elected to retire certain capital spare equipment. Loss on impairment during the prior year of $745 million relates to a $685 million charge on three of our semisubmersibles, the Noble Driller, the Noble Jim Thompson and the Noble Paul Wolff, which we decided not to actively market as a result of the declining market conditions, and a $60 million impairment charge for goodwill that originated from the acquisition of Frontier in 2010.\nOther Income and Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses. Overall, general and administrative expenses decreased $30 million in 2015 from 2014, primarily as a result of decreased office and other expenses of $13 million, employee related costs of $10 million and legal and other professional fees of $7 million.\nInterest Expense, net of amount capitalized. Interest expense, net of amount capitalized, increased $59 million in 2015 from 2014. The increase is a result of the issuance of $1.1 billion of Senior Notes in March 2015, coupled with lower capitalized interest in the current year as compared to the prior year due primarily to the completion of construction on four of our newbuild jackups and two of our newbuild drillships. During the current year, we capitalized approximately 10 percent of total interest charges versus approximately 23 percent during the prior year.\nInterest Income and Other, Net. Interest income and other, net increased $38 million in the current year as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily the result of $30 million of interest income recognized in connection with the Noble Homer Ferrington arbitration award, coupled with $5 million of interest received on a U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) tax refund for the years 2006 and 2007 during the current year.\nIncome Tax Provision. Our income tax provision increased $53 million in the current year, of which $27 million related to the Noble Homer Ferrington arbitration award. Excluding the arbitration award, our income tax provision increased by $26 million. Excluding the impact of the impairment charges recognized in 2015 and 2014 and the Noble Discoverer contract cancellation payment in the fourth quarter of 2015, taxes decreased $7 million as a result of a lower worldwide effective tax rate, partially offset by higher pre-tax income. The 13 percent decrease in the worldwide effective tax rate during the current year generated a $19 million decrease to income tax expense, and was primarily a result of the geographic mix of pre-tax income, the effect of lower downtime and various discrete items. This was partially offset by a 9 percent increase in pre-tax earnings, which generated a $12 million increase in income tax expense.\nDiscontinued Operations. There was no activity related to discontinued operations during the current year. During the prior year, net income from discontinued operations was $161 million. In 2014, revenues reported within discontinued operations were $1.0 billion and operating income included within discontinued operations was $220 million.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nGeneral\nNet loss from continuing operations attributable to Noble-UK for 2014 was $152 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $3.2 billion, compared to net income from continuing operations for 2013 of $479 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, on operating revenues of $2.5 billion.\nAs a result of Noble-UK conducting all of its business through Noble-Cayman and its subsidiaries, the financial position and results of operations for Noble-Cayman, and the reasons for material changes in the amount of revenue and expense items between 2014 and 2013, would be the same as the information presented below regarding Noble-UK in all material respects, except operating income for Noble-Cayman for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $50 million and $65 million higher, respectively, than operating income for Noble-UK for the same periods. The operating income difference is primarily a result of executive costs directly attributable to Noble-UK for operations support and stewardship related services. In addition, we had non-recurring costs of $63 million and $18 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to the Spin-off, which we recognized as part of discontinued operations at the Noble-UK level.\nRig Utilization, Operating Days and Average Dayrates\nOperating results from continuing operations for our contract drilling services segment are dependent on three primary metrics: rig utilization, operating days and dayrates. The following table sets forth the average rig utilization, operating days and average dayrates for our rig fleet for 2014 and 2013:\n\n \n (1) We define utilization for a specific period as the total number of days our rigs are operating under contract, divided by the product of the total number of our rigs, including cold stacked rigs, and the number of calendar days in such period. Information reflects our policy of reporting on the basis of the number of available rigs in our fleet, excluding newbuild rigs under construction. \n (2) Information reflects the number of days that our rigs were operating under contract. \nContract Drilling Services\nThe following table sets forth the operating results from continuing operations for our contract drilling services segment for 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) We record reimbursements from customers for out-of-pocket expenses as operating revenues and the related direct costs as operating expenses. Changes in the amount of these reimbursables generally do not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n ** Not a meaningful percentage. \nOperating Revenues. Changes in contract drilling services revenues for 2014 as compared to 2013 were driven by increases in both average dayrates and operating days. The 13 percent increase in average dayrates increased revenues by approximately $352 million while the 14 percent increase in operating days increased revenues by an additional $341 million.\nThe increase in contract drilling services revenues relates to our drillships and jackups, which generated approximately $636 million and $219 million more revenue, respectively, in 2014. These amounts were offset by decreases in revenues for our semisubmersibles, which declined $162 million from 2013.\nThe increase in drillship revenues was driven by a 61 percent increase in operating days and a 19 percent increase in average dayrates, resulting in a $420 million and a $216 million increase in revenues, respectively, from 2013. The increase in both average dayrates and operating days was primarily the result of the newbuilds Noble Don Taylor, Noble Globetrotter II, Noble Bob Douglas, Noble Sam Croft and Noble Tom Madden, which commenced their contracts in August 2013, September 2013, December 2013, July 2014 and November 2014, respectively. Additionally, there were favorable dayrate changes on the contracts for the Noble Bully II and the Noble Discoverer during 2014.\nThe 22 percent increase in jackup average dayrates resulted in a $118 million increase in revenues, which was coupled with a 23 percent increase in jackup operating days, resulting in a $101 million increase in revenues from 2013. The increase in both average dayrates and operating days resulted from the contract commencements of the Noble Mick O'Brien, Noble Regina Allen, Noble Houston Colbert and Noble Sam Turner in November 2013, January 2014, March 2014 and August 2014, respectively. Additionally, a contract extension on the Noble Roger Lewis resulted in a favorable dayrate change during 2014. This was partially offset by increased downtime on the Noble Scott Marks and the Noble David Tinsley. Furthermore, the Noble Lewis Dugger, which was sold in July 2013, was utilized during a portion of 2013.\nThe 6 percent increase in average dayrates on our semisubmersibles resulted in a $70 million increase in revenues from 2013. The increase in average dayrates was due to favorable dayrate changes on new contracts across the semisubmersible fleet, as well as the Noble Paul Romano returning to work during 2014. The 18 percent decline in operating days resulted in a $232 million decrease in revenues driven by contract completions on the Noble Paul Wolff, Noble Homer Ferrington and Noble Max Smith. Additionally, the Noble Amos Runner was in the shipyard undergoing regulatory inspections and maintenance during a portion of 2014 but operated during 2013.\nOperating Costs and Expenses. Contract drilling services operating costs and expenses increased $332 million for 2014 as compared to 2013. A significant portion of the increase was due to the crew-up and operating expenses for our newbuild rigs as they commenced, or prepared to commence, operating under contracts, which added approximately $322 million in expense in 2014. The remaining change was primarily driven by a $20 million increase in mobilization expense due to certain rig moves and the demobilization of certain rigs, partially offset by a $5 million decrease in operations support and rig-related expenses and a $5 million decrease in rig and operations support labor.\nDepreciation and amortization increased $111 million in 2014 over 2013, which is primarily attributable to newbuild rigs placed in service since the beginning of 2013 as noted above.\nLoss on impairment during 2014 related to a $685 million charge on our semisubmersibles, Noble Driller, Noble Jim Thompson and Noble Paul Wolff, which we decided not to actively market as a result of market conditions. Additionally, we fully impaired the $60 million of goodwill on our books in 2014, which originated from the acquisition of Frontier in 2010, as a result of a significant decline in the market value of our stock, coupled with a decrease in oil and gas prices, significant reductions in the projected dayrates for new contracts and reduced utilization forecasts. Loss on impairment during 2013 was related to our two cold stacked submersible rigs arising from the potential disposition of these assets to an unrelated third party. These submersible rigs were subsequently sold to an unrelated third party in January 2014 for a total sales price of $7 million.\nGain on disposal of assets during 2013 was attributable to the sale of the Noble Lewis Dugger to an unrelated third party in Mexico.\nGain on contract settlements/extinguishments during 2013 was attributable to the $45 million settlement of all claims against the former shareholders of Frontier, which we acquired in July 2010, relating to alleged breaches of various representations and warranties contained in the purchase agreement. A portion of the settlement, totaling approximately $14 million, was allocated to discontinued operations as it related to certain rigs spun-off as part of the Paragon Offshore transaction.\nOther Income and Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses. Overall, general and administrative expenses decreased $11 million in 2014 from 2013 primarily as a result of decreased legal and tax expenses related to ongoing projects.\nInterest Expense, net of amount capitalized. Interest expense, net of amount capitalized, increased $49 million in 2014 from 2013. The increase is a result of lower capitalized interest in 2014 as compared to 2013 due primarily to the completion of construction on four of our newbuild drillships and four of our newbuild jackups, partially offset by the repayment of our $300 million fixed rate senior note in June 2013 and our $250 million fixed rate senior note in March 2014 using availability under our commercial paper program at lower interest rates. During 2014, we capitalized approximately 23 percent of total interest charges versus approximately 52 percent during 2013.\nIncome Tax Provision. Our income tax provision increased $15 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. Excluding the impact of the impairment charges recognized in 2014 and 2013 and the sale of the Noble Lewis Dugger in 2013, taxes increased $58 million driven by a higher worldwide effective tax rate and higher pre-tax income. A 34 percent increase in the worldwide effective tax rate during 2014 increased income tax expense by $36 million. The increase in the worldwide effective tax rate was a result of a change in the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings and the effect of the new UK tax law, which became effective retroactively to April 1, 2014, offset by favorable discrete items. Additionally, a 28 percent increase in pre-tax earnings generated a $22 million increase in income tax expense.\nDiscontinued Operations. Net income from discontinued operations for 2014 was $161 million as compared to $304 million for 2013. Revenues reported within discontinued operations were $1.0 billion during 2014 as compared to $1.7 billion for 2013. Operating income included within discontinued operations was $220 million during 2014 and $381 million for 2013. The variance is attributable to seven months of operations in 2014 versus a full year of operations in 2013, coupled with a $45 million increase in non-recurring Spin-off costs during 2014.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nCash flows from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are combined with cash flows from continuing operations within each cash flow statement category on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Net cash from operating activities in 2015 was $1.8 billion, which compared to $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively. We had working capital of $377 million and $260 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2015 was $433 million, which compared to $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The variance primarily relates to lower capital expenditures related to our newbuild expenditures as projects were completed in prior years, coupled with expenditures for rigs spun-off with Paragon Offshore in 2014 and 2013.\nNet cash used in financing activities in 2015 was $886 million, which compared to net cash provided from financing activities of $285 million and $615 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2015, our primary uses of cash included the repayment of our $350 million 3.45% Senior Notes in August 2015, coupled with shareholder dividend payments of approximately $316 million, the repurchase of 6.2 million shares in 2015 for $101 million and dividends paid to noncontrolling interests of approximately $72 million. Our total debt as a percentage of total debt plus equity decreased to 38 percent at December 31, 2015, down from 40 percent at December 31, 2014 as a result of the repayment of certain maturing notes during 2015. Although we issued $1.1 billion of Senior Notes in March 2015, this amount was substantially offset by a net reduction in indebtedness outstanding on our Credit Facilities and commercial paper program during 2015 as a result of the application of proceeds from the Senior Notes offering.\nOur principal source of capital in 2015 was cash generated from operating activities coupled with the $1.1 billion Senior Notes offering in March 2015. Cash generated during 2015 was primarily used to repay indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Facilities and commercial paper program, pay normal recurring operating expenses and repay our $350 million 3.45% Senior Notes.\nOur currently anticipated cash flow needs, both in the short-term and long-term, may include the following:\n \u00b7 normal recurring operating expenses; \n \u00b7 committed and discretionary capital expenditures; \n \u00b7 repayment of debt; and \n \u00b7 payments of dividends. \nWe currently expect to fund these cash flow needs with cash generated by our operations, cash on hand, borrowings under our existing credit facility, potential issuances of long-term debt, or asset sales. However, to adequately cover our expected cash flow needs, we may require capital in excess of the amount available from these sources, and we may seek additional sources of liquidity and/or delay or cancel certain discretionary capital expenditures or other payments as necessary.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had a total contract drilling services backlog of approximately $6.9 billion. Our backlog as of December 31, 2015 includes a commitment of 68 percent of available days for 2016. See Contract Drilling Services Backlog\u201d for additional information regarding our backlog.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures, including capitalized interest, totaled $423 million, $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Capital expenditures during 2015 consisted of the following:\n \u00b7 $345 million for sustaining capital, major projects, subsea related expenditures and upgrades and replacements to drilling equipment; \n \u00b7 $53 million in newbuild expenditures, including costs for the Noble Lloyd Noble and trailing costs on our recently completed newbuilds; and \n \u00b7 $25 million in capitalized interest. \nOur total capital expenditure budget for 2016 is approximately $800 million, which is currently anticipated to be spent as follows:\n \u00b7 approximately $461 million in newbuild expenditures; and \n \u00b7 $339 million for sustaining capital, major projects, subsea related expenditures and upgrades and replacements to drilling equipment, including capitalized interest that may fluctuate as a result of the timing of completion of ongoing projects. \nIn connection with our capital expenditure program, we have entered into certain commitments, including shipyard and purchase commitments, for approximately $598 million at December 31, 2015, all of which we expect to spend in 2016.\nFrom time to time we consider possible projects that would require expenditures that are not included in our capital budget, and such unbudgeted expenditures could be significant. In addition, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of drilling units from time to time. Other factors that could cause actual capital expenditures to materially exceed plan include delays and cost overruns in shipyards (including costs attributable to labor shortages), shortages of equipment, latent damage or deterioration to hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions, changes in governmental regulations and requirements and changes in design criteria or specifications during repair or construction.\nDividends\nOur most recent quarterly dividend payment to shareholders, totaling approximately $38 million (or $0.15 per share), was declared on January 29, 2016 and paid on February 16, 2016 to holders of record on February 8, 2016.\nThe declaration and payment of dividends require authorization of the Board of Directors of Noble-UK and such dividends on issued share capital may be paid only out of Noble-UK's distributable reserves\u201d on its statutory balance sheet. Noble-UK is not permitted to pay dividends out of share capital, which includes share premiums. As of December 31, 2015 Noble's distributable reserves are $1.8 billion. The payment of future dividends will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future business prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nShare Repurchases\nUnder UK law, the Company is only permitted to purchase its own shares by way of an off-market purchase\u201d in a plan approved by shareholders. In December 2014, we received shareholder approval to repurchase up to 37 million ordinary shares, or approximately 15 percent of our outstanding ordinary shares at the time of the shareholder approval. The authority to make such repurchases will expire at the end of the Company's 2016 annual general meeting of shareholders. At this time, we do not expect to seek shareholder approval for further repurchases at our 2016 annual general meeting.\nIn January 2015, we repurchased 6.2 million of our ordinary shares at an average price of $16.10 per share, excluding commissions and stamp tax. Including these items, the average price paid per share during January 2015 was $16.21.\nShare repurchases for each of the three years ended December 31 are as follows:\n\n \n (1) The total cost and average price paid per share includes the impact of commissions and stamp tax for share repurchases made in the open market. \nCredit Facilities and Senior Unsecured Notes\nCredit Facilities and Commercial Paper Program\nAt December 31, 2015, we had two credit facilities with an aggregate maximum capacity of $2.7 billion, which are comprised of a five year $2.4 billion senior unsecured credit facility that matures in January 2020 and a $225 million 364-day senior unsecured credit facility that matured in January 2016 and was not renewed (together, the Credit Facilities\u201d).\nWe have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.4 billion in unsecured commercial paper notes. Amounts issued under the commercial paper program are supported by the unused capacity under our credit facility and, therefore, are classified as long-term on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The outstanding amounts of commercial paper reduce availability under our credit facility.\nAs of February 12, 2016, we had no amounts drawn on our credit facility and no commercial paper issued.\nOur credit facility provides us with the ability to issue up to $500 million in letters of credit. The issuance of letters of credit under the facility reduces the amount available for borrowing. At February 12, 2016, we had no letters of credit issued under the facility.\nAccess to our commercial paper program is dependent upon our credit ratings. A decline in our credit ratings below investment grade would prohibit us from accessing the commercial paper market. If we were unable to access the commercial paper market, we would transfer any outstanding borrowings to our credit facility. Our credit facility has interest rates that are generally higher than those found in the commercial paper market, which would result in increased interest expense in the future.\nIn addition, our credit facility and certain of our senior unsecured notes, as discussed below, have provisions which vary the applicable interest rates based upon our credit ratings. If our credit ratings were to decline, the interest expense under our Credit Facilities and certain of our senior unsecured notes would increase.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOur total debt related to senior unsecured notes was $4.5 billion at December 31, 2015 as compared to $3.7 billion at December 31, 2014. The increase in senior unsecured notes outstanding is a result of the issuance of $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes in March 2015, which we issued through our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Noble Holding International Limited ( NHIL\u201d). These Senior Notes were issued in three separate tranches, consisting of $250 million of 4.00% Senior Notes due 2018, $450 million of 5.95% Senior Notes due 2025 and $400 million of 6.95% Senior Notes due 2045. The weighted average coupon of all three tranches is 5.87%. The interest rate on these Senior Notes may be increased if the credit rating applicable to the notes is downgraded below investment grade (up to a maximum of 200 basis points). The net proceeds of approximately $1.08 billion, after expenses, were used to repay indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Facilities and commercial paper program.\nIn August 2015, we repaid our $350 million 3.45% Senior Notes using cash on hand.\nOur $300 million 3.05% Senior Notes matured during the first quarter of 2016. We anticipate using cash on hand to repay the outstanding balances.\nCovenants\nThe Credit Facilities and commercial paper program are guaranteed by our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries, Noble Holding International Limited ( NHIL\u201d) and Noble Holding Corporation ( NHC\u201d). The covenants and events of default under the two Credit\nFacilities are substantially similar, and each facility contains a covenant that limits our ratio of debt to total tangible capitalization, as defined in the Credit Facilities, to 0.60. At December 31, 2015, our ratio of debt to total tangible capitalization was approximately 0.38. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2015.\nIn addition to the covenants from the Credit Facilities noted above, the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes contain covenants that place restrictions on certain merger and consolidation transactions, unless we are the surviving entity or the other party assumes the obligations under the indenture, and on the ability to sell or transfer all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, there are restrictions on incurring or assuming certain liens and on entering into sale and lease-back transactions. At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. We continually monitor compliance with the covenants under our notes and expect to remain in compliance during 2016.\nOther\nAt December 31, 2015, we had letters of credit of $5 million, including bonds covering the temporary importation of equipment, performance bonds and expatriate visa guarantees.\nSummary of Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\n\n \n (1) Purchase commitments consist of obligations outstanding to external vendors primarily related to future capital purchases. \n (2) Tax reserves are included in Other\u201d due to the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements to taxing authorities. See Note 14 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements. \nAt December 31, 2015, we had other commitments that we are contractually obligated to fulfill with cash if the obligations are called. These obligations include letters of credit that guarantee our performance as it relates to our drilling contracts, tax and other obligations in various jurisdictions. These letters of credit obligations are not normally called, as we typically comply with the underlying performance requirement.\nThe following table summarizes our other commercial commitments at December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation. Critical accounting policies and estimates that most significantly impact our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts, those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and entities in which we hold a controlling financial interest. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of two joint ventures, in each of which\nwe own a 50 percent interest. Our ownership interest meets the definition of variable interest under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) codification and we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe combined joint venture carrying amount of the Bully-class drillships at December 31, 2015 totaled $1.4 billion, which was primarily funded through partner equity contributions. Operating revenues were $334 million, $372 million and $355 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net income totaled $154 million, $157 million and $145 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost, reduced by provisions to recognize economic impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $761 million and $970 million of construction-in-progress, respectively. Such amounts are included in Property and equipment, at cost\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are sold, retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the gain or loss is recognized. Drilling equipment and facilities are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as of the date placed in service or date of major refurbishment. Estimated useful lives of our drilling equipment range from three to thirty years. Other property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over useful lives ranging from two to forty years.\nDuring 2015, we sold for parts the previously retired semisubmersible rigs, the Noble Paul Wolff, the Noble Driller and the Noble Jim Thompson. In connection with the sale of these rigs, we received proceeds of approximately $5 million.\nInterest is capitalized on construction-in-progress using the weighted average cost of debt outstanding during the period of construction. Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $25 million, $47 million and $115 million, respectively.\nScheduled maintenance of equipment is performed based on the number of hours operated in accordance with our preventative maintenance program. Routine repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred; however, the costs of the overhauls and asset replacement projects that benefit future periods and which typically occur every three to five years are capitalized when incurred and depreciated over an equivalent period. These overhauls and asset replacement projects are included in Property and equipment, at cost\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts, net of accumulated depreciation, totaled $202 million and $179 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Depreciation expense from continuing operations related to overhauls and asset replacement totaled $75 million, $77 million and $70 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nWe evaluate the impairment of property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In addition, on an annual basis, we complete an impairment analysis on our rig fleet. An impairment loss on our property and equipment exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset's carrying value over the estimated fair value. As part of this analysis, we make assumptions and estimates regarding future market conditions. To the extent actual results do not meet our estimated assumptions, for a given rig class, we may take an impairment loss in the future.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, in connection with our annual impairment analysis, we decided that we would no longer market one of our drillships, the Noble Discoverer. The decision was a result of the termination of the contract for this rig by Shell in December 2015 and the decreased opportunities for rigs of this type in the current marketplace. We also reviewed assumptions on the future marketability of one of our jackups, the Noble Charles Copeland, after its contract completion in late September 2015, with consideration given to its years in service, limited technical features and anticipated capital requirements in light of the current market conditions. As a result of this analysis, we have decided to discontinue marketing this unit. Additionally, as a result of a fourth quarter review of capital spare equipment, we elected to retire certain capital spare equipment. In connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, we evaluated these units and certain capital spare equipment for impairment and recorded an impairment charge of $406 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAlso in 2015, we determined that certain corporate assets were partially impaired due to a declining market for, and the potential disposal of, the assets. We estimated the fair value of the assets based on quotes from brokers of similar assets (Level 2). Based on these estimates, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring 2014, we recorded a $685 million impairment charge on three of our semisubmersibles, the Noble Driller, the Noble Jim Thompson and the Noble Paul Wolff, which we decided to no longer actively market as a result of the declining market conditions.\nDuring 2012, we recorded a $13 million impairment charge on our submersible fleet, primarily as a result of the declining market outlook for drilling services for that rig type. During 2013, we recorded an additional impairment charge of approximately $4 million on our two cold stacked submersible rigs arising from the potential disposition of these assets to an unrelated third party. In January 2014, we completed the sale of the submersibles for a total sales price of $7 million.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur typical dayrate drilling contracts require our performance of a variety of services for a specified period of time. We determine progress towards completion of the contract by measuring efforts expended and the cost of services required to perform under a drilling contract, as the basis for our revenue recognition. Revenues generated from our dayrate-basis drilling contracts and labor contracts are recognized on a per day basis as services are performed and begin upon the contract commencement, as defined under the specified drilling or labor contract. Dayrate revenues are typically earned, and contract drilling expenses are typically incurred ratably over the term of our drilling contracts. We review and monitor our performance under our drilling contracts to confirm the basis for our revenue recognition. Revenues from bonuses are recognized when earned, and when collectability is reasonably assured.\nIn our dayrate drilling contracts, we typically receive compensation and incur costs for mobilization, equipment modification or other activities prior to the commencement of a contract. Any such compensation may be paid through a lump-sum payment or other daily compensation. Pre-contract compensation and costs are deferred until the contract commences. The deferred pre-contract compensation and costs are amortized into income, using the straight-line method, over the term of the initial contract period, regardless of the activity taking place. This approach is consistent with the economics for which the parties have contracted. Once a contract commences, we may conduct various activities, including drilling and well bore related activities, rig maintenance and equipment installation, movement between well locations or other activities.\nDeferred revenues from drilling contracts totaled $180 million and $263 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Such amounts are included in either Other current liabilities\u201d or Other liabilities\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based upon our expected time of recognition. Related expenses deferred under drilling contracts totaled $78 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to $94 million at December 31, 2014, and are included in either Prepaid expenses and other current assets\u201d or Other assets\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based upon our expected time of recognition.\nIn April 2015, we agreed to contract dayrate reductions for five rigs working for Saudi Aramco, which were effective from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. However, given current market conditions and based on discussions with the customer, we do not expect the rates to return to the original contract rates. In accordance with accounting guidance, we are recognizing the reductions on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the existing Saudi Aramco contracts. At December 31, 2015, revenues recorded in excess of billings as a result of this recognition totaled $53 million, and are included in either Prepaid expenses and other current assets\u201d or Other assets\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based upon our expected time of recognition.\nWe record reimbursements from customers for out-of-pocket\u201d expenses as revenues and the related direct cost as operating expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nWe operate in a number of countries throughout the world and our tax returns filed in those jurisdictions are subject to review and examination by tax authorities within those jurisdictions. We recognize uncertain tax positions that we believe have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained. We cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any existing or future assessments.\nDuring 2014, the IRS began its examination of our tax reporting in the U.S. for the taxable years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011. We believe that we have accurately reported all amounts in our 2010 and 2011 tax returns. We believe the ultimate resolution of the IRS examination will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nUnder the tax sharing agreement ( TSA\u201d) entered into at the time of the Spin-off, Noble and Paragon Offshore are each responsible for the taxes that relate to their respective business and provide a corresponding indemnity. In addition, in February 2016, we entered into an agreement in principle with Paragon Offshore (the Agreement in Principle\u201d) relating to tax matters in Mexico described below in exchange for a full and unconditional release of any claims by Paragon Offshore in connection with the Spin-off (including any claims that could be brought on behalf of its creditors).\nAudit claims of approximately $174 million attributable to income and other business taxes have been assessed against us in Mexico, as detailed below. Under our Agreement in Principle, we agreed to assume the administration of Paragon Offshore's Mexican income and value-added taxes for the years 2005 through 2010 and for Paragon Offshore's Mexican customs taxes through\n2010, as well as the related bonding obligations and certain of the tax related liabilities. In addition, under the Agreement in Principle, we would (i) pay all of the ultimate resolved amount of Mexican income and value-added taxes related to Paragon Offshore's business that were incurred through a Noble-retained entity, (ii) pay 50 percent of the ultimate resolved amount of Mexican income and value-added taxes related to Paragon Offshore's business that were incurred through a Paragon Offshore-retained entity, (iii) pay 50 percent of the ultimate resolved amount of Mexican custom taxes related to Paragon Offshore's business, and (iv) be required to post any tax appeal bond that may be required to challenge a final assessment. Tax assessments of approximately $50 million for income and value-added taxes have been made against Noble entities in Mexico. Tax assessments for income and value-added taxes of approximately $202 million have been made against Paragon Offshore entities in Mexico, of which approximately $46 million relates to Noble's business that operated through Paragon Offshore-retained entities in Mexico prior to the Spin-off. We will only be obligated to post a tax appeal bond in the event a final assessment is made by Mexican authorities. As of February 12, 2016, there have only been $3 million in final assessments that have been bonded.\nIn January, 2015, Noble received an official notification of a ruling from the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court in Mexico. The ruling settled an ongoing dispute in Mexico relating to the classification of a Noble subsidiary's business activity and the applicable rate of depreciation under the Mexican law applicable to the activities of that subsidiary. The ruling did not result in any additional tax liability to Noble. Additionally, the ruling is only applicable to the Noble subsidiary named in the ruling and, therefore, does not establish the depreciation rate applicable to the assets of other Noble subsidiaries. Under the Agreement in Principle, we would be responsible for any tax liability ultimately incurred because these depreciation liabilities would be incurred by Noble-retained entities, and such amounts are reflected in the discussion of Mexican audit claims in the preceding paragraph. We will continue to contest future assessments received, and do not believe we are liable for additional tax.\nParagon Offshore has received tax assessments of approximately $122 million attributable to income, customs and other business taxes in Brazil, of which $38 million relates to Noble's business that operated through a Paragon Offshore-retained entity in Brazil prior to the Spin-off. Under the TSA, we must indemnify Paragon Offshore for all assessed amounts that are related to Noble's Brazil business, approximately $38 million, if and when such payments become due.\nWe have contested, or intend to contest or cooperate with Paragon Offshore in Brazil where it is contesting, the assessments described above, including through litigation if necessary, and we believe the ultimate resolution, for which we have not made any accrual, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Tax authorities may issue additional assessments or pursue legal actions as a result of tax audits and we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of such assessments and legal actions or our ability to collect indemnities from Paragon Offshore under the TSA or the Agreement in Principle.\nWe have been notified by Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. ( Petrobras\u201d) that it is currently challenging assessments by Brazilian tax authorities of withholding taxes associated with the provision of drilling rigs for its operations in Brazil during 2008 and 2009. Petrobras has also notified us that if Petrobras must ultimately pay such withholding taxes, it will seek reimbursement from us for the portion allocable to our drilling rigs. The amount of withholding tax that Petrobras indicates may be allocable to Noble drilling rigs is R$79 million (approximately $20 million). We believe that our contract with Petrobras requires Petrobras to indemnify us for these withholding taxes. We will, if necessary, vigorously defend our rights.\nIn certain circumstances, we expect that, due to changing demands of the offshore drilling markets and the ability to redeploy our offshore drilling units, certain units will not reside in a location long enough to give rise to future tax consequences. As a result, no deferred tax asset or liability has been recognized in these circumstances. Should our expectations change regarding the length of time an offshore drilling unit will be used in a given location, we will adjust deferred taxes accordingly.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe maintain various levels of self-insured retention for certain losses including property damage, loss of hire, employment practices liability, employers' liability and general liability, among others. We accrue for property damage and loss of hire charges on a per event basis.\nEmployment practices liability claims are accrued based on actual claims during the year. Maritime employer's liability claims are generally estimated using actuarial determinations. General liability claims are estimated by our internal claims department by evaluating the facts and circumstances of each claim (including incurred but not reported claims) and making estimates based upon historical experience with similar claims. At both December 31, 2015 and 2014, loss reserves for personal injury and protection claims totaled $21 million, and such amounts are included in Other current liabilities\u201d in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCertain Significant Estimates and Contingent Liabilities\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. In addition, we are involved in several litigation matters, some of which could lead to potential liability to us. We follow FASB standards regarding contingent liabilities which are discussed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18-Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-08, which amends FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 205, Presentation of Financial Statements\u201d and ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment.\u201d This ASU alters the definition of a discontinued operation to cover only asset disposals that are a strategic shift with a major effect on an entity's operations and finances, and calls for more extensive disclosures about a discontinued operation's assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The guidance is effective for all disposals, or classifications as held-for-sale, of components of an entity that occur within annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. This standard was not early adopted in connection with the Spin-off. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, which creates ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition,\u201d including most industry-specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. In addition, ASU 2014-09 supersedes the cost guidance in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition-Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts,\u201d and creates new Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs-Contracts with Customers.\u201d In summary, the core principle of Topic 606 is to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. Companies are allowed to select between two transition methods: (1) a full retrospective transition method with the application of the new guidance to each prior reporting period presented, or (2) a retrospective transition method that recognizes the cumulative effect on prior periods at the date of adoption together with additional footnote disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, and early application is not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and have not made any decision on the method of adoption.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, which amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation.\u201d The guidance requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition and should not be reflected in the estimate of the grant-date fair value of the award. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The guidance can be applied prospectively for all awards granted or modified after the effective date or retrospectively to all awards with performance targets outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, which amends ASC Subtopic 205-40, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to continue as a Going Concern.\u201d The amendments in this ASU provide guidance related to management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, which amends ASC Subtopic 225-20, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items.\u201d The amendment in this ASU eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. The amendments in this\nupdate are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, which amends ASC Subtopic 810, Consolidations.\u201d This amendment affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, the amendments modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities; eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The standard may be applied retrospectively or through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, which amends ASC Subtopic 835-30, Interest - Imputation of Interest.\u201d The guidance requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the associated debt liability. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The new guidance will be applied on a retrospective basis. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15 which amends ASC Subtopic 835-30, Interest - Imputation of Interest.\u201d The guidance allows a debt issuance cost related to a line-of-credit to be presented in the balance sheet as an asset and subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the line-of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-04, which amends ASC Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits.\u201d The guidance gives an employer whose fiscal year end does not coincide with a calendar month end the ability, as a practical expedient, to measure defined benefit retirement obligations and related plan assets as of the month end that is closest to its fiscal year end. The ASU also provides a similar practical expedient for interim remeasurements of significant events. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-12, which amends ASC Topic 960, Plan Accounting-Defined Benefit Pension Plans,\u201d ASC Topic 962, Defined Contribution Pension Plans\u201d and ASC Topic 965, Health and Welfare Benefit Plans.\u201d There are three parts to the ASU that aim to simplify the accounting and presentation of plan accounting. Part I of this ASU requires fully benefit-responsive investment contracts to be measured at contract value instead of the current fair value measurement. Part II of this ASU requires investments (both participant-directed and nonparticipant-directed investments) of employee benefit plans be grouped only by general type, eliminating the need to disaggregate the investments in multiple ways. Part III of this ASU provides a similar measurement date practical expedient for employee benefit plans as available in ASU No. 2015-04, which allows employers to measure defined benefit plan assets on a month-end date that is nearest to the year's fiscal year-end when the fiscal period does not coincide with a month-end. Parts I and II of the new guidance should be applied on a retrospective basis. Part III of the new guidance should be applied on a prospective basis. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, which amends Topic 805, Business Combinations.\u201d This amendment eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, and revise comparative information for prior periods presented in financial statements. Those adjustments are required when new information about circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date would have affected the measurement of the amount initially recognized. This update requires an entity to recognize these adjustments in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. An acquirer must record the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. An entity must present separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment had been recognized as of the acquisition date. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this guidance is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, which amends ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.\u201d This amendment aligns the presentation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities with International Financial Reporting Standards. International Accounting Standard 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets be offset and presented as\na single amount is not affected by the amendments in this update. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments in this update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td>",

contains extensive information, but here is a summarized version:\n\n- Noble's financial performance for 2015 included $3.4 billion in operating revenues, $511 million in net income (diluted at $2.06 per share), $1.8 billion in net cash from operating activities, and a decrease in debt to 38% of total capitalization.\n- The offshore drilling market in 2015 was challenging due to rig oversupply, declining customer demand, and a sharp decrease in oil prices from June 2014 to December 2015.\n- Despite the difficult market, Noble is focusing on operational efficiency, cost control, and margin preservation, including possibly stacking or retiring additional rigs.\n- Noble remains confident in the long-term prospects of the industry and its own modern fleet of high-specification rigs.\n- Noble's strategy emphasizes deepwater drilling and high-specification jackups across global oil and gas basins.\n- Noble has one remaining newbuild, the Noble Lloyd Noble, expected to operate under a four-year contract in the North Sea in Q3 2016.\n- Impairment charges of $406 million were recognized in 2015 for rigs no longer marketed and certain capital spare equipment, as well as $13 million for certain corporate assets.\n- The spin-off of Paragon Offshore was completed on August 1, 2014, and Noble-UK entered into several agreements to govern the separation and relationship post-spin-off.\n- As of December 31, 2015, Noble has a contract drilling services backlog of approximately $6.9 billion, with 68% of available days committed for 2016.\n- Net income from continuing operations in 2014 was a loss of $152 million (diluted at $0.60 per share) on operating revenues of $3.2 billion, while 2013 saw a net income from continuing operations of $479 million (diluted at $1.86 per share) on operating revenues of $2.5 billion.\n- Cash flows and capital investments, pension contributions, tax matters, debt obligations, and interest payments are outlined, with measures in place to address obligations through operating cash, available credit, and potential asset sales.\n- Noble is compliant with all debt covenants, and while there are various legal and tax disputes, the resolution of these is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial statements.\n- The adoption of recent accounting standards is being assessed and is not anticipated to materially impact Noble's financial position.\n\n[The report is truncated due to the extensive original content, focusing on the most critical financial aspects and business conditions.]"}
