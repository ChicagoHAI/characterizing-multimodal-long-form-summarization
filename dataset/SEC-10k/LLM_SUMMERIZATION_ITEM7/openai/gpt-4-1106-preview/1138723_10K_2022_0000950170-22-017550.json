MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K, particularly in Risk Factors.\u201d See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nCompany\nAccuray Incorporated is a radiation therapy company that develops, manufactures, sells and supports market-changing solutions that are designed to deliver radiation treatments for even the most complex cases, while making commonly treatable cases even more straightforward, to meet the full spectrum of patient needs. We believe in comparison to conventional linear accelerators, our treatment delivery, planning, and data management solutions provide better accuracy, flexibility, and control; fewer treatments with shorter treatment times; and the technology to expand beyond cancer, making it easier for clinical teams around the world to provide treatments that help patients get back to living their lives, faster.\nOur innovative technologies, the CyberKnife\u00ae and TomoTherapy\u00ae platforms, including the Radixact\u00ae System, our next generation TomoTherapy platform, are designed to deliver advanced treatments, including stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), and adaptive radiation therapy (ART). The CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms have complementary clinical applications with the same goal: to empower our customers to deliver the most precise and accurate treatments while still minimizing dose to healthy tissue, helping to reduce the risk of side effects that may impact patients' quality of life. Each of these systems serves patient populations treated by the same medical specialty, radiation oncology, with advanced capabilities. The CyberKnife platform is also used by neurosurgeons specializing in radiosurgery to treat patients with tumors in the brain and spine, and neurologic disorders. In addition to these products, we also provide services, which include post-contract customer support (warranty period services and post warranty services), installation services, training, and other professional services.\nThe CyberKnife Platform\nThe CyberKnife platform is the only robotic, full-body stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivery device on the market. The latest generation is the CyberKnife S7 System, which combines speed, advanced precision, and real-time artificial intelligence (AI)-driven motion tracking and synchronized treatment delivery for all SRS and SBRT treatments, in as little as 15 minutes. The platform is designed to treat cancerous and benign tumors throughout the body, as well as neurologic disorders. The use of SRS and SBRT with the CyberKnife platform to treat tumors throughout the body has grown significantly in recent years. SRS and SBRT are performed on an outpatient basis in a limited number of treatment sessions - typically 1-5 fractions. They enable the treatment of patients who might not otherwise be treated with radiation, who may not be good candidates for surgery, or who desire a non-surgical treatment option.\nThe CyberKnife S7 System includes disease-specific tracking and treatment delivery solutions for brain, spine, lung and prostate tumors, improvements in treatment speed as compared to earlier systems, more options to configure the treatment room, and expanded number of nodes leading to more coverage and minimizing dose to healthy tissue. The system has the option of fixed collimators plus the Iris Variable Aperture Collimator and/or InCise Multileaf Collimator (MLC). With the addition of the InCise MLC, the CyberKnife S7 System enables treatment of larger tumors previously thought untreatable with radiosurgery and SBRT. The InCise MLC and IMRT planning tools enable expansion of indications that can be treated with a CyberKnife platform to include many IMRT indications.\nUsing our Synchrony\u00ae real-time target tracking with dynamic delivery technology and computer controlled robotic mobility, the CyberKnife platform is designed to deliver radiation from a wide array of beam angles and autonomously track, detect and correct for even the slightest tumor and patient movement in real time throughout the entire treatment. This design is intended to enable the CyberKnife platform to deliver high dose radiation with precision and accuracy, which minimizes damage to surrounding healthy tissue and eliminates the need for invasive head or body immobilization frames.\nThe Accuray Precision\u00ae Treatment Planning System (TPS) with the VOLO Optimizer software on the CyberKnife S7 System enables customers to significantly improve operational efficiency by reducing both the time to create high quality treatment plans and the time it takes to deliver patient treatments. The next-generation TPS with the optimizer facilitates the development of clinically optimal treatment plans up to 90 percent faster than before and the delivery of the treatment up to an estimated 50 percent faster than before the availability of this software.\nWe believe the CyberKnife platform offers clinicians and patients significant benefits over other vendors' radiation therapy systems in the market.\nThe long-term success of the CyberKnife platform is dependent on a number of factors including the following:\n\u2022Continued adoption of our CyberKnife platform, including the CyberKnife M6 System and CyberKnife S7 System, in markets where they are available;\n\u2022Greater awareness among doctors and patients of the benefits of radiosurgery delivered with the CyberKnife platform, including its robotic architecture and Synchrony technology and VOLO optimizer;\n\u2022Continued evolution in clinical studies demonstrating the safety, efficacy and other benefits of using the CyberKnife platform to treat tumors in various parts of the body;\n\u2022Change in medical practice leading to utilization of stereotactic body radiation therapy more regularly as an alternative to surgery or other treatments;\n\u2022Continued advances in our technology that improve the quality of treatments and ease of use of the CyberKnife platform;\n\u2022Receipt of regulatory approvals in various countries which are expected to improve access to radiosurgery with the CyberKnife S7 System in such countries;\n\u2022Medical insurance reimbursement policies that cover CyberKnife platform treatments; and\n\u2022Our ability to expand sales of CyberKnife M6 and S7 Systems in countries throughout the world where we do not currently sell or have not historically sold a significant number of any CyberKnife platform configurations.\nThe Radixact System, the Next-Generation TomoTherapy Platform\nThe Radixact System, the next generation TomoTherapy platform, allows for fully integrated radiation treatment planning, delivery and data management, enabling clinicians to deliver ultra-precise treatments to more than 50 patients per day. The platform's ring gantry architecture enables precise and efficient treatments with a high degree of dose conformity, while the high-speed binary MLC effectively modulates and shapes the radiation beam as it is emitted. The combination of the ring gantry and the MLC enable treatment to be delivered continuously in a 360 degree helical pattern around the patient's body (TomoHelical). Additionally, the TomoDirect feature provides the TomoTherapy platform with added versatility, enabling the delivery of high quality, fixed angle beams. The two treatment delivery modes - TomoHelical and TomoDirect - provide flexibility in the types of indications that can be treated with radiation, from the simplest to the most complex cases, multiple tumors and recurrent tumors.\nOur Synchrony real-time target tracking with dynamic delivery for the Radixact System adds intrafraction motion synchronization capabilities to this device, enabling real-time tracking, visualization and correction for tumor motion during treatment, with the goal of improving dose accuracy and treatment times as compared to conventional radiation therapy systems. Synchrony can be used on the Radixact System to adapt treatment delivery for tumors that move as a result of bodily processes, including respiration and digestion, as well as patient movement. Treatments are truly personalized, as delivery is adapted to the individual's unique movements throughout treatment delivery. If movement changes during treatment, delivery is adapted for that unique change.\nThe Radixact System seamlessly integrates with ClearRT helical kVCT high-fidelity imaging, providing clinicians with an option to produce exceptional diagnostic-like quality CT images, quickly and cost-effectively, to improve patient care. ClearRT imaging provides the largest imaging field of view available on a radiation delivery system at 50 cm (diameter) by 135 cm (long), and speed, as evidenced by its ability to capture a 1-meter image in only 1 minute. ClearRT delivers enhanced imaging capabilities compared to conventional linear accelerator systems that rely on cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging and as an alternative to MR-based radiation therapy systems that can be complex and cost prohibitive to use.\nThe TomoTherapy platform integrates into a single system all of the key elements for radiation therapy, including treatment planning, CT image guided patient positioning, treatment delivery, quality assurance and adaptive planning. The imaging and treatment planning capabilities of many traditional systems are more modular or require cumbersome add ons or separate treatment planning systems that result in clinicians taking more steps between scanning, planning and treatment of patients. Conversely, the integrated imaging and treatment features of the Radixact System allows clinicians to scan, plan and treat cancer patients efficiently. Treatment plans as well as daily images can be easily accessed remotely, enabling clinical teams to collaboratively work together, regardless of location, ensuring higher quality plan development and delivery.\nWe believe the TomoTherapy platform offers clinicians and patients significant benefits over other vendors' radiation therapy systems in the market. The long-term success of the TomoTherapy platform is dependent on a number of factors including the following:\n\u2022Continued adoption of our TomoTherapy platform, including the Radixact System, in markets where it is available;\n\u2022Greater awareness among doctors and patients of the unique benefits of radiation therapy using the TomoTherapy platform, including its ring gantry architecture that enables treatment delivery from multiple 360 degree rotations around the patient, and ClearRT helical kVCT imaging for the Radixact System, designed to produce exceptional diagnostic-like quality CT images, quickly and cost-effectively;\n\u2022Advances in our technology that improve the quality of treatments and ease of use of TomoTherapy platform;\n\u2022Greater awareness among doctors of the now-established reliability of TomoTherapy platform; and\n\u2022Our ability to expand sales of TomoTherapy platform in countries throughout the world where we do not currently sell or have not historically sold a significant number of any TomoTherapy platform configurations.\nSale of Our Products\nGenerating revenue from the sale of our platforms is a lengthy process. Selling our platforms, from first contact with a potential customer to a signed sales contract that meets our backlog criteria (as discussed below) varies significantly and generally spans between six months and two years. The length of time between receipt of a signed contract and revenue recognition is generally governed by the time required by the customer to build, renovate or prepare the treatment room for installation of the platform.\nIn the United States, we primarily market directly to customers, including hospitals and stand-alone treatment facilities, through our sales organization we also market to customers through sales agents and group purchasing organizations. Outside the United States, we market to customers directly and through use of distributors and sales agents. In addition to our offices in the United States, we have sales and service offices in Europe, India, Asia, and South America.\nAs of June 30, 2022, our systems were named in 100 out of 118 Class A user licenses awarded in the 13th five year plan by the China National Health Commission to purchase radiation therapy devices. The Chinese Ministry of Health requires a tender process following the license awards for all participating end user hospitals prior to being able to take receipt of a Class A device. This tender process defines the transactional terms and conditions related to each hospital's equipment order and does not put us in a competitive bidding situation that would result in changes in the specific device for which the hospital has received the Class A user license. During the year ended June 30, 2022, we delivered Class A devices to China and recognized system revenue related to such devices of approximately $65.1 million in the same period. We currently anticipate system revenue related to the remaining Class A user licenses awarded to date in the next 12 to 18 months. Despite the challenges and uncertainties in China and around the world, including those created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to believe that China remains the world's fastest growing market for radiation oncology systems and the pandemic does not affect the long-term demand for radiotherapy equipment in China.\nJoint Venture\nIn January 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Accuray Asia Limited ( Accuray Asia\u201d), entered into an agreement with CNNC High Energy Equipment (Tianjin) Co., Ltd. (the CIRC Subsidiary\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Isotope & Radiation Corporation, to form a joint venture, CNNC Accuray (Tianjin) Medical Technology Co. Ltd. (the JV\u201d), to manufacture and sell radiation oncology systems in China. The JV aims to be uniquely positioned to serve China, which we believe is the world's largest growth market for radiation oncology systems. China represents a significantly underserved market for linacs based on the country's population and cancer incidence rates on both an absolute and relative country basis. Accuray Asia has a 49% ownership interest in the JV and the CIRC Subsidiary has a 51% ownership interest in the JV.\nIn July 2019, the JV broke ground on its facility based in Tianjin, China, which serves as its headquarters and home of its manufacturing, sales organization and service operations. The JV has received its Radiation Safety License from the China Ministry of Environmental Protection, along with its license to do business in China and Medical Device Operating Permit, enabling the JV to sell, install and provide further service to our radiation therapy devices in China. The JV has also completed construction of its manufacturing facility and has obtained the Quality Management System certification with ISO13485 standard.\nWith the receipt of the necessary permits and licenses to operate, the JV has begun selling products in China, much like a distributor. In the long term, we anticipate that the JV will manufacture and sell a locally branded Made in China\u201d radiotherapy device in the Class B license category, or Class B device, which would replace our current offering in that category. We believe this strategy will allow us to best maximize both near and longer-term opportunities in China. Required testing for the Class B device is ongoing and the National Medical Products Administration (\"NMPA\") submission is expected to finish in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022 as the due date has been extended as a result of the COVID-19 travel restrictions.\nWe apply the equity method of accounting to our ownership interest in the JV as we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the JV but lack controlling financial interest and are not the primary beneficiary. We recognize revenue on sales to the JV in the current period, eliminating 49% of profit to the extent goods sold have not been sold through by the JV to an end customer at the end of such reporting period. We deferred $5.4 million and $2.1 million of intra-entity profit margin as of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. During the year ended June 30, 2022, we recognized $1.4 million of previously deferred intra-entity profit margin from sales and recorded intra-entity profit margin deferral of $4.7 million from sales executed during the period. Our consolidated accumulated deficit includes $1.0 million of accumulated gains related to our equity method investment.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we had carrying value of $12.9 million in the JV and owned a 49% interest in the entity. Our proportional share of the underlying equity in net assets of the JV was approximately $14.6 million. The difference between the carrying value of the equity investment and our proportional share of the underlying equity in net assets of the JV of $1.7 million, adding back $5.4 million of eliminated intra-entity profit, constitutes equity method goodwill of $4.7 million at June 30, 2022 that is subject to impairment analysis. No impairment was identified as of June 30, 2022.\nCOVID-19 and Economic Conditions\nIn fiscal year 2020, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19\u201d) was surfaced in Wuhan, China and was subsequently recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world and while conditions have improved, the pace and degree of recovery varies significantly. In response to this pandemic, governments and private industry have taken preventative or protective actions at varying levels, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, which has resulted in the temporary or permanent closure of certain businesses, as well as advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, particularly in group settings. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business operations as well as those of our customers and partners. In addition, across the healthcare industry, resources are being prioritized for the treatment and management of the pandemic and away from non-urgent or elective procedures. Some of our customers, which include hospitals, major academic medical centers, and other related entities, have incurred losses during the COVID-19 pandemic due to significantly reduced patient volume. The public health actions being undertaken to reduce the spread of the virus have created and may continue to create significant disruptions with respect to demand for our products and services; the operating procedures and workflow of our customers, particularly hospitals; our ability to continue to manufacture our products; and the reliability of our supply chain.\nOur financial results have also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in various ways. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to adversely impact the pace at which our backlog converts to revenue in the near-term. This is primarily the result of pandemic-related delays in the timing of deliveries and installations which has adversely affected our revenue. We have experienced such delays in deliveries and installations since the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 and expect that such delays will continue to some degree , which could have a negative impact on our revenue. We have also experienced disruptions in sales and delays in customer payments as a result of changes to and redirection of customer resources to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and closures of customer facilities. We have also received requests from a few customers to extend payment terms or temporarily suspend service and corresponding payment obligations and while we have only received a small number of requests thus far, there can be no guarantee that more customers will not ask for the same. In addition, the global supply chain is continuing to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other geopolitical uncertainty as disruptions in parts of our supply chain have resulted in delays in the receipt of certain components for our products as well as increased pricing pressure for such parts. These ongoing supply chain challenges and heightened logistics costs have affected our gross margins and net income (loss), and our current expectations are that gross margins and net income (loss) will continue to be adversely affected by increased material costs and freight and logistic expenses at least through the remainder of the calendar year of 2022, if not longer. Furthermore, certain parts required for the manufacture and servicing of our products, such as electronic components, are scarce and becoming increasingly difficult to source even at increased prices. If such parts become unavailable to us, we would not be able to manufacture or service our products, which would adversely impact revenue, gross margins, and net income (loss). As a result, we are carefully monitoring the pandemic and related economic impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We intend to continue to execute on our strategic plans and operational initiatives. However, given the uncertainty regarding the spread, severity and potential resurgence of COVID-19, the impact of new COVID-19 variants, vaccination deployment efforts, how long the pandemic and associated health measures will last, as well as the related economic impacts, including supply chain issues and inflation, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K, the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated with any certainty at this time, although the impacts are expected to continue and may significantly affect our business. We expect that the impacts on our customers' business and our business will continue through this period of economic uncertainty as supply chain issues, inflation and other factors continue to worsen or emerge. Accordingly, management is carefully evaluating our liquidity position, communicating with and monitoring the\nactions of our customers and suppliers, and reviewing our near-term financial performance as the uncertainty related to these factors continues to unfold.\nBacklog\nAs of June 30, 2022, backlog totaled $563.7 million, of which $0.2 million represented upgrades sold through service contracts. As of June 30, 2021, backlog totaled $616.4 million.\nIn order for the product portion of a system sales agreement to be counted as backlog, it must meet the following criteria:\n\u2022The contract is properly executed by both the customer and us. A customer purchase order that incorporates the terms of our contract quote will be considered equivalent to a signed and executed contract. The contract has either cleared all its contingencies or contained no contingencies when signed;\n\u2022We have received a minimum deposit or a letter of credit; or the sale is to a customer where a deposit is deemed not necessary or customary (i.e. sale to a government entity, a large hospital, group of hospitals or cancer care group that has sufficient credit, customers with trade-in of existing equipment, sales via tender awards, or indirect channel sales that have signed contracts with end-customers);\n\u2022The specific end customer site has been identified by the customer in the written contract or written amendment; and\n\u2022Less than 2.5 years have passed since the contract met all the criteria above.\nAlthough our backlog includes only contractual agreements with our customers for the purchase of our CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms, including the Radixact Systems and related upgrades, we cannot provide assurance that we will convert backlog into recognized revenue due primarily to factors outside of our control. The amount of backlog recognized into revenue is primarily impacted by three items: cancellations, age-outs and foreign currency fluctuations. Orders could be cancelled for reasons including, without limitation, changes in customers' needs, priorities or financial condition, changes in government or health insurance reimbursement policies, or changes to regulatory requirements. In addition to cancellations, after 2.5 years, if we have not been able to recognize revenue on a contract, we remove the revenue associated with the contract from backlog and the order is considered aged out. Contracts may age-out for many reasons, including but not limited to, inability of the customer to pay, inability of the customer to adapt their facilities to accommodate our products in a timely manner, or inability to timely obtain licenses necessary for customer facilities or operation of our equipment. Our backlog also includes amounts not denominated in U.S. Dollars and therefore fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar as compared to other currencies will impact revenue. Generally, strengthening of the U.S. Dollar will negatively impact revenue. Backlog is stated at historical foreign currency exchange rates, and revenue is released from backlog at current exchange rates, with any difference recorded as a backlog adjustment.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the pace of new orders and the pace at which our backlog converts to revenue in the near-term and we expect this to continue. Although the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact individual markets could vary based on a number of factors, we have seen and expect to continue to see a higher than normal level of age-outs in the coming quarters as a result.\nA summary of gross orders, net orders, and order backlog is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 5: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross orders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>332,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>325,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>377,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net age-outs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(148,869\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(122,132\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81,073\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cancellations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,348\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,119\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,939\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Currency impacts and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,735\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,746\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net orders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Order backlog at the end of the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>563,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>616,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>602,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Orders and Book to Bill Ratio\nGross orders are defined as the sum of new orders recorded during the period adjusted for any revisions to existing orders during the period. Our book to bill ratio is defined as gross orders for the period divided by product revenue for the period.\nGross orders increased by $6.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. This was primarily due to an increase in CyberKnife platform orders and upgrades of $8.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively. TomoTherapy platform orders decreased by $5.8 million while upgrades increased by $2.1 million. In addition, gross order activity during the year ended June 30, 2021 was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the Americas region. Our book to bill ratio for June 30, 2022 was 1.5 as compared to 1.8 for June 30, 2021.\nGross orders decreased by $51.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. This was primarily due to a decline in China Class A system orders as the prior year order volume reflected significant pent-up demand from our end users and distributor, which was triggered by the announcement of the China Class A system quotas back in 2018. In addition, gross order activity during the year ended June 30, 2021 was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the Americas region. Accordingly, TomoTherapy platform order and upgrades order volume decreased by $48.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year. CyberKnife platform orders decreased by $5.9 million while upgrades increased by $1.4 million. The decrease in CyberKnife platform orders was primarily due to the normalization of China Class A system orders for the year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to prior fiscal year where we experienced higher volumes of orders due to significant pent-up demand. Our book to bill ratio for June 30, 2021 was 1.8 as compared to 2.3 for June 30, 2020.\nNet Orders\nNet orders are defined as gross orders less cancellations, age-outs, foreign exchange and other adjustments during the period.\nNet orders decreased by $24.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, resulting from an increase in age-outs of $35.0 million and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $7.9 million offset by an increase in age-ins of $8.2 million, an increase in gross orders of $6.3 million, and a decrease in cancellations of $3.8 million.\n\u2022The age-outs for the year ended June 30, 2022 were $183.8 million. There were $34.9 million of age-ins. Age-ins represent orders that previously aged-out but have been recognized as revenue in the current period, compared to $148.8 million of age-outs and $26.6 million of age-ins in the same period last fiscal year.\n\u2022There were $11.3 million of cancellations in year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to $15.1 million of cancellations in the year ended June 30, 2021. Cancellations are outside of our control and are difficult to\nforecast; however, we continue to work closely with our customers to minimize the impact of cancellations on our business.\n\u2022Foreign currency impacts and other adjustments decreased net orders by $4.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to an increase in net orders by $3.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nNet orders decreased by $88.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020, resulting from a decrease of gross orders of $51.4 million, an increase in age-outs of $47.2 million, an increase in cancellations of $1.2 million, partially offset by an increase in age-ins of $6.1 million and a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $4.9 million.\n\u2022The age-outs for the year ended June 30, 2021 were $122.1 million. There were $6.1 million of age-ins. Age-ins represent orders that previously aged-out but have been recognized as revenue in the current period, compared to $81.1 million of age-outs and $20.5 million of age-ins in the same period last fiscal year.\n\u2022There were $15.1 million of cancellations in year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to $13.9 million of cancellations in the year ended June 30, 2020. Cancellations are outside of our control and are difficult to forecast; however, we continue to work closely with our customers to minimize the impact of cancellations on our business.\n\u2022Foreign currency impacts and other adjustments increased net orders by $3.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to a decrease in net orders by $1.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2020.\nIn recent years, the percentage of gross orders received from our distribution partners in the international markets represented 71%, 82%, and 76% of gross orders for fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We anticipate that distributor orders from international markets will continue to represent a significant portion of our gross orders in the foreseeable future. International orders are affected by foreign currency fluctuation as well as government programs that stimulate the purchase of healthcare products, both of which could affect the demand for our products and timing of orders from period to period. In addition, our order-to-revenue conversion cycle for international distributor orders has been generally longer compared to that of direct channel sales and could cause fluctuations in our age-outs from period to period.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal 2022 results compared to 2021 (in thousands, except percentages)\nTable 6: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

See Note 13.\nNet revenue\nProduct Net Revenue\nProduct net revenue increased by $38.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 or 22%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to an increase in unit volume sales due to strong performance in the Americas region due to pent-up demand post-COVID coupled with an increase in system average product revenue. The increase is driven by an increase in revenue from the Americas, EMEA, and China regions offset by a unit volume decline in the Japan region.\nService Net Revenue\nService net revenue decreased by $4.4 million, or 2%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in service contract revenue of $3.6 million driven by the strong US dollar that reduced the dollar value of all foreign currency service contract revenue, primarily in Japan and Europe, slightly offset by an increase in installation revenue.\nNet revenue by geographic region, based on the shipping location of our customer, is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 7: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>429,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>396,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Europe, Middle East, India and Africa\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Asia Pacific, excluding Japan and China\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Japan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>China\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit\nThe overall gross profit for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased by $0.4 million, relatively flat as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, due to an increase in product gross profit of $12.9 million, or 17%, driven by an increase in product revenue as a result of higher shipments offset by a decrease in service gross profit of $12.4 million or 15% driven by $8.0 million increase in service cost mainly due to higher part consumption and $4.4 million lower service revenue.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $5.0 million, or 10%, for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase was driven by an increase of $4.3 million in compensation and employee benefits expenses mainly due to additional headcount and an increase of $1.2 million in outside services offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in operational cost due to a decrease in materials costs for research and development projects.\nSelling and marketing expenses\nSelling and marketing expenses increased $6.8 million, or 16%, for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $4.1 million in compensation and benefits cost due to an increase in headcount, an increase of $2.0 million in marketing expenses due to a greater number of in-person tradeshows as compared to virtual tradeshows in the previous year and an increase of $1.3 million in traveling expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $2.7 million, or 6%, for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.3 million in operating cost due to increases in insurance premiums and higher bad debt expense and an increase of $0.9 million in outside services related to consulting fees and our reinstatement of compensatory fees for our board of directors in fiscal 2022.\nIncome on equity method investment, net\nIncome (loss) on equity method investment was an income of $0.2 million as compared to an income of $0.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2021.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net decreased by $17.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The decrease was primarily related to lower interest cost due to lower interest rates on our debt in fiscal 2022 and the loss on extinguishment of old convertible notes in fiscal 2021. The impact of these items was partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange gain.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was higher in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily driven by a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to undistributed earnings in France, Japan and Switzerland.\nFiscal 2021 results compared to 2020 (in thousands,

increase in unit volume sales coupled with an increase in system average product revenue of $18.8 million. The increase is driven by an increase in revenue from China, offset by a unit volume decline in the Americas, EMEA and Japan regions partly as a result of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic\non revenue conversion timing with our customers in those regions and a decrease in system upgrades of $9.5 million due to the timing of release of ClearRT that was anticipated by customers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nService Net Revenue\nService net revenue increased by $4.0 million, or 2%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to an increase in service contract revenue of $2.8 million, a reduced cost of service of $2.6 million, and an increase in upgrade and installation revenue of $1.8 million, offset by a decrease in training revenue and revenue from service parts.\nNet revenue by geographic region, based on the shipping location of our customer, is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>396,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>382,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Europe, Middle East, India and Africa\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Asia Pacific, excluding Japan and China\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Japan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>China\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit\nThe overall gross profit for the year ended June 30, 2021 increased by $9.8 million, or 7%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020, due to an increase in service gross profit of $6.7 million, or 9%, driven by an increase in service contract revenue of $4.0 million including, upgrades and installation services, from an increase in the number of installed systems, coupled with a reduced cost of service of $2.6 million and an increase in product gross profit of $3.1 million, or 4%, which was driven by higher revenue from system unit sales volume coupled with an increase in system average product revenue.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $2.9 million, or 6%, for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase was driven by an increase of $2.5 million in compensation and employee benefits expenses mainly due to reinstatement of bonuses to employees in fiscal year 2021, which were suspended in fiscal year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase of $2.2 million in outside services offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in travel expenses due to decreased travel as a result of travel restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and a decrease of $0.5 million in facilities expenses.\nSelling and marketing expenses\nSelling and marketing expenses decreased $4.4 million, or 9%, for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of $3.0 million due to the lower cost of key trade shows that were held virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease of $2.0 million in travel expenses, a decrease of $0.9 million in marketing promotion and materials and $0.2 million lower consulting expense, offset by an increase of $1.7 million in compensation and employee benefits mainly due to the reinstatement of bonuses to employees in fiscal year 2021, which were suspended in fiscal year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $1.6 million, or 4%, for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.6 million in compensation and employee benefits mainly due to the reinstatement of bonuses to employees in fiscal year 2021, which were suspended in fiscal year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase of $1.7 million this fiscal year compared to prior fiscal year due to the conclusion of a foreign indirect tax audit in fiscal year 2020 offset by a decrease in expense for allowance for credit losses of $1.6 million and a decrease in outside services and consulting of $1.2 million.\nIncome on equity method investment, net\nIncome (loss) on equity method investment was an income of $0.9 million as compared to a loss of $0.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net increased by $21.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the non-cash gain of $13.0 million related to the value of the Accuray systems contributed to the JV in exchange for 49% equity interest that was recorded in fiscal year 2020, an increase of $5.7 million due to loss on extinguishment of debt and a $4.3 million due to loss on the exchange of our 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2022 that was treated as an extinguishment of old notes. The impact of these items was offset by an increase of $0.4 million in net foreign currency exchange gain, a decrease of $1.2 million in interest expense and a $0.2 million payment received for building improvements to a facility that was vacated in 2020.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was lower in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to lower foreign earnings in fiscal 2021. We also released income tax benefits in fiscal 2020 related to final tax assessments from the Swiss tax authorities for the fiscal period 2018 that otherwise would have reflected a much higher income tax expense for us in fiscal 2020.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded share-based compensation expense of $10.6 million, $9.3 million, and $8.2 million, respectively, related to awards under our stock incentive plans. Share-based compensation expense was recorded net of estimated forfeitures. As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately $14.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock options, shares under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period from 0.6 to 2.4 years.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt June 30, 2022, we had $88.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates and inflation, world events, including the Russian-Ukraine war, continuing uncertainty associated with COVID-19 and the risks included in Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors.\u201d Also refer to Note 10, Debt to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the New Credit Facilities and the Notes as of June 30, 2022. Based on our cash and cash equivalents balance, available debt facilities, current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that we will have sufficient cash resources and anticipated cash flows to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, we continue to critically review our liquidity and anticipated capital requirements in light of the significant uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn May 2021, we issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 under an indenture between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. $97.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2026 were issued to certain holders of 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2022 in exchange for $82.1 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2022 outstanding and $2.9 million aggregate principal amount were issued for cash. Concurrently, in May 2021, we entered into a senior secured credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, individually as a lender and agent, and\nthe other lenders (the Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides for a new five-year $80 million term loan facility and a $40 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement, including $25 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, were funded on May 14, 2021, and as of June 30, 2022 we had an outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility of $5.0 million.\nOur liquidity and cash flows has been and could continue to be materially impacted by the diversion of customer resources to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as delays in payments from customers and could be further impacted by additional and prolonged delays in payments from customers, the potential risk mitigation measures, facility closures, or other reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic. There remain uncertainties as to how the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to materially impact our liquidity in the future.\nIn addition, we are unable to predict with certainty the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to maintain compliance with the debt covenants contained in the credit and security agreements related to our Credit Facilities, including financial covenants regarding the fixed charge coverage ratio and the consolidated senior net leverage ratio. While we were in compliance with such covenants for the year ended June 30, 2022, failure to meet the covenant requirements in the future could cause us to be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately payable. This may require us to obtain waivers or amendments to the credit and security agreement in order to maintain compliance and there can be no certainty that any such waiver or amendment will be available, or what the cost of such waiver or amendment, if obtained, would be. If we are unable to obtain necessary waivers or amendment and the debt under such credit facility is accelerated, we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates, which may not be favorable to us. There is no guarantee that we would be able to satisfy our obligations if any of our indebtedness is accelerated.\nAdditionally, the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at June 30, 2022 for all countries except Japan, France and Switzerland are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and unavailable for distribution in the form of dividends or otherwise. Repatriation of the Company's foreign earnings from Japan, France and Switzerland are subject to income taxes. As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately $55.1 million of cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries. When such funds are repatriated, there will be additional foreign tax withholdings imposed depending on the country from which the funds were repatriated.\nIn addition, the long sales cycle, together with delays in the shipment of CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms or customer cancellations that have increased in light of the COVID-19 pandemic have affected our ability to recognize revenue, which could adversely affect our cash flows.\nCash Flows\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,400\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,469\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,717\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,399\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,728\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,369\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,805\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash\nequivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,561\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,047\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted our global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets all of which could negatively impact our business operations and cash flows for the foreseeable future, including reductions in revenue and delays in payments from customers. The challenges posed by COVID-19 on our business are expected to evolve rapidly. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption and volatility in the financial markets, could materially affect our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $2.4 million in fiscal 2022, resulting primarily from changes in working capital of $22.6 million and a net loss of $5.3 million offset by $25.5 million of non cash items.\n\u2022The net change in working capital was primarily due to increases of $22.9 million in inventories, $12.5 million in accounts receivable, $6.0 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, and decreases of $0.8 million in operating lease liabilities and $1.4 million in deferred revenues, offset by increases of $11.7 million in accounts payable, $6.7 million in accrued liabilities, $1.2 million in customer advances and decrease of $1.5 million in deferred costs.\n\u2022Non-cash items primarily consisted of share-based compensation expense of $10.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $5.5 million, a write-down of inventory of $3.5 million, profit elimination in transactions with the JV of $3.3 million, and provision for deferred income tax of $1.8 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $38.5 million in fiscal 2021, resulting primarily from non cash items of $39.4 million and changes in working capital of $7.6 million offset by, a net loss of $6.3 million.\n\u2022Non-cash items primarily consisted of the loss on extinguishment of debt of $4.3 million related to the exchange of our 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2022 for our 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2026 and $5.7 million related to refinancing of our credit facilities with new lenders, depreciation and amortization expense of $6.4 million, share-based compensation expense of $9.3 million, inventories write-down of $6.9 million, non-cash interest expense on debt of $4.9 million, amortization of debt issuance cost of $1.4 million and intra-entity profit elimination from transactions with the JV of $0.3 million, offset by an in-kind system upgrade contribution to the JV of $1.4 million and an income on equity method investment of $0.9 million;\n\u2022The net change in working capital of $7.6 million was primarily due to an increase of $8.1 million in compensation related accrued liabilities due to bonus accrual, a decrease in accounts receivable of $5.2 million and a decrease of $1.7 million in inventories offset by a decrease of $4.0 million in accounts payable, a decrease of $1.6 million in customer advances, deferred revenue and deferred cost of revenue, an increase of $1.0 million in prepaid expenses and other assets and a decrease of $0.7 million in net operating lease liabilities.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $1.5 million in fiscal 2020, resulting primarily from a net negative change in working capital of $21.2 million offset by non cash items of $15.9 million and a net income of $3.8 million.\n\u2022Non-cash items primarily consisted of the gain on contribution to the JV of $13.0 million, offset by depreciation and amortization expense of $7.5 million, share-based compensation expense of $8.2 million, non-cash interest expense on debt of $4.2 million, inventories write-down of $4.2 million, provision of bad debt of $1.8 million, intra-entity profit elimination from transactions with the JV of $1.8 million, amortization of debt issuance cost of $1.3 million, deferred tax benefit of $0.4 million and a loss on equity method investment of $0.1 million;\n\u2022The net change in operating assets and liabilities of $21.2 million was primarily due to an increase of $23.2 million in inventories due to slower than anticipated conversion of our order backlog to revenue, a decrease of $16.6 million in compensation related accrued liabilities and reduction in bonus accrual, a decrease of $6.8 million in accounts payable and a decrease of $0.2 million in net operating lease liabilities offset by receivable collection and a decrease in accounts receivable of $19.0 million, a decrease of $4.4 million in prepaid expense and other assets and an increase of $1.5 million in customer advances, deferred revenue and deferred cost of revenue.\nCash Flows From Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $4.7 million in fiscal 2022, which primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment of $4.7 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.4 million in fiscal 2021, which primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment of $2.3 million and an additional investment in the JV of $0.1 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $3.7 million in fiscal 2020, which primarily consisted of purchases of property and equipment.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2022 was $15.4 million, which was primarily due to $15.0 million of repayments under Revolving Credit Facility and $4.0 million paydown in debt offset by $2.3 million in proceeds from employee stock plans and proceeds from options exercises.\nNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2021 was $28.8 million, primarily due to the repayment of all outstanding obligations and termination of the Prior Revolving Credit Facility and Prior Term Loan of $105.4 million, the prepayment during the year of $10.0 million of the principal amount outstanding on our Prior Term Loan, the amendment fee of $0.5 million related to our Prior Credit Facilities, the repurchase of our common stock of $14.1 million, the paydown on our New Revolving Credit Facility of $5.0 million, $0.1 million net cost related to the exchange of our 3.75% Convertible Notes 3.75% due 2022 for our 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2026 and $0.3 million in taxes paid related to net settlement of equity awards, offset by net proceeds from New Revolving Credit Facility and New Term Loan Facility of $103.7 million, proceeds from employee stock plans of $2.2 million and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $0.9 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2020 was $26.7 million, which was primarily due to a net draw of $24.7 million, net, drawn against our Prior Term Loan Facility and $2.5 million in proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan offset by $0.3 million, net repayments under our Prior Revolving Credit Facility and $0.2 million in taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards.\nOperating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nOur future capital requirements depend on numerous factors. These factors include but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022Revenue generated by sales of our products and service plans;\n\u2022Our ability to generate cash flows from operations;\n\u2022Costs associated with our sales and marketing initiatives and manufacturing activities;\n\u2022Facilities, equipment and IT systems required to support current and future operations;\n\u2022Rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities;\n\u2022Costs of obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory clearances of our products;\n\u2022Effects of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022Number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\n\u2022Servicing and maturity of our current future indebtedness;\n\u2022The impact of inflation of our expenses; and\n\u2022The unpredictable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on collections, supply chains and logistics.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents balance will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. If these sources of cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, or we believe market conditions are favorable, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or enter into additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional financing may not be available at all, or in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain this additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements and Contractual Obligations\nOur purchase commitments and obligations include all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services and acquisition and licensing of intellectual property. A majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. Our long-term material cash requirements include lease obligations. See Note 5. Leases.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt June 30, 2022 we had open currency forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies with a stated, or notional, value of approximately $68.3 million. The fair value of the underlying currency based upon the June 30, 2022 exchange rate was approximately $68.3 million. At June 30, 2021 we had open currency forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies with a stated, or notional, value of approximately $54.2 million. The fair value of the underlying currency based upon the June 30, 2022 exchange rate was approximately $54.2 million. We did not have any off balance sheet arrangements for the year ended June 30, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. However, the economic uncertainty in the current environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could limit our ability to accurately make and evaluate our estimates and judgments. Actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates if actual conditions differ from our assumptions.\nAll of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1, The Company and its Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Management believes the critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, assessment of recoverability of goodwill, valuation of inventories, convertible notes, impairment of investments and allowance for credit losses.\nConcentration of Credit and Other Risks\nOur cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several major financial institutions. At times, deposits in these institutions exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. We have not experienced any losses in such accounts and do not believe that we are exposed to any significant risk of loss on these balances.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022 there was one customer that represented 10% or more of total net revenue and for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, there were one and no customers, respectively, that represented 10% or more of total net revenue. We had two customers as of June 30, 2022 and two customers as of June 30, 2021, respectively, that each accounted for more than 10% of our total accounts receivable, net.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain reserves for potential credit losses. Accounts receivable are deemed past due in accordance with the contractual terms of the agreement. Accounts receivable balances are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once collection efforts are unsuccessful.\nSingle-source suppliers presently provide us with several components. In most cases, if a supplier was unable to deliver these components, we believe that we would be able to find other sources for these components subject to any regulatory qualifications, if required.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is primarily derived from sales of CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms and services, which include PCS contracts (warranty period services and post-warranty services), installation services, training and other professional services. We record our revenue net of any value added or sales tax. We recognize revenue for certain performance obligations at the point in time when control is transferred, such as delivery of products. We recognize revenue for certain other performance obligations over a period of time as control of the goods or services is transferred, such as PCS and construction contracts. Payments received in advance of system shipment are recorded as customer advances and are deferred until product shipment when they are recognized in revenue. We assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer. We generally do not request collateral from our customers.\nWe frequently enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple performance obligations. For sale arrangements that contain multiple performance obligations, we account for individual products and services separately if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on relative its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The stand-alone selling price ( SSP\u201d). The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which we separately sell the products and services. If a SSP is not directly observable, then we will estimate the SSP considering market conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.\nProduct Revenue\nThe majority of product revenue is generated from sales of CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms, including Radixact Systems. Revenue is recognized once the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product to a customer, which is generally upon delivery.\nWe record revenue from sales of systems, product upgrades and accessories to our customers based on the general terms and conditions of the executed sales and distribution agreements as well as the specific terms and conditions executed for each sale, and once the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product to a customer.\nWe record revenue considering all discounts given to, or expected by, customers. As a result, management may make estimates of potential future product returns or trade ins and other allowances related to product revenue in the current period. In general, we do not allow returns from customers and all discounts and allowances are clearly identified in the terms and conditions of each sale. We derive some product revenue from sales to the JV.\nService Revenue\nService revenue is generated primarily from PCS, installation services, training and professional services. Service revenue is recognized either ratably over the contractual period as control and benefit transfer to the customer or when service is performed, depending on specific terms and conditions in agreements with customers. We derive some service revenue from sales to the JV.\nCosts associated with service revenue are expensed when incurred, except when those costs are related to system upgrades purchased within a service contract. In those cases, the costs of such upgrades are recognized at the time control and benefit of the upgrade transfers to the customer.\nAssessment of Recoverability of Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identified intangible net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis and when impairment indicators are present. We have one operating segment and one reporting unit. Therefore, our consolidated net assets, including existing goodwill are considered to be the carrying value of the reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on the closing price of our common stock on the trading day closest to the annual review date multiplied by the outstanding shares on that date. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is in excess of its fair value, an impairment may exist, and we must perform the second step of the analysis, in which the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to its carrying value to determine the impairment charge, if any. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required.\nValuation of Inventories\nThe valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as damaged inventory. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of product demand to support future sales and service. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce purchasing and manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory beyond the current reserve, which would negatively impact our gross margin.\nConvertible Notes\nWe account for convertible notes in accordance with applicable guidance which specifies that an issuer of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity component of the conversion option. The amount recorded as debt is based on the fair value of the debt component as a standalone instrument, determined based on an implied credit spread interest rate for nonconvertible debt. This implied credit spread was derived from the trading history of our convertible notes and a range of estimated market volatility. The difference between the debt recorded at inception and its principal amount is accreted to principal during the estimated life of the note. ASC 470-50, provides guidance on modifications to or exchanges of line-of-credit or revolving arrangements which should be evaluated based on borrowing. We adopted ASU 2020-06 in fiscal year 2022, using the modified retrospective method, which no longer accounts for the liability and equity component separately.\nImpairment of Investments\nWe have an equity investment in CNNC Accuray (Tianjin) Medical Technologies Co. Ltd., the Company's joint venture in China. The Company's equity method investment is held at cost and adjusted for impairment when it would be deemed to be impaired. We monitor this investment for events or circumstances indicative of a potential\nimpairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying value if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition or near term prospects of the investee.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers prior to authorizing shipment for all major sale transactions. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. If our evaluation of our customers' financial conditions does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions may be needed and our operating results could be negatively affected.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K, particularly in Risk Factors.\u201d See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nCompany\nAccuray Incorporated is a radiation therapy company that develops, manufactures, sells and supports market-changing solutions that are designed to deliver radiation treatments for even the most complex cases, while making commonly treatable cases even more straightforward, to meet the full spectrum of patient needs. We believe in comparison to conventional linear accelerators, our treatment delivery, planning, and data management solutions provide better accuracy, flexibility, and control; fewer treatments with shorter treatment times; and the technology to expand beyond cancer, making it easier for clinical teams around the world to provide treatments that help patients get back to living their lives, faster.\nOur innovative technologies, the CyberKnife\u00ae and TomoTherapy\u00ae platforms, including the Radixact\u00ae System, our next generation TomoTherapy platform, are designed to deliver advanced treatments, including stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), and adaptive radiation therapy (ART). The CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms have complementary clinical applications with the same goal: to empower our customers to deliver the most precise and accurate treatments while still minimizing dose to healthy tissue, helping to reduce the risk of side effects that may impact patients' quality of life. Each of these systems serves patient populations treated by the same medical specialty, radiation oncology, with advanced capabilities. The CyberKnife platform is also used by neurosurgeons specializing in radiosurgery to treat patients with tumors in the brain and spine, and neurologic disorders. In addition to these products, we also provide services, which include post-contract customer support (warranty period services and post warranty services), installation services, training, and other professional services.\nThe CyberKnife Platform\nThe CyberKnife platform is the only robotic, full-body stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivery device on the market. The latest generation is the CyberKnife S7 System, which combines speed, advanced precision, and real-time artificial intelligence (AI)-driven motion tracking and synchronized treatment delivery for all SRS and SBRT treatments, in as little as 15 minutes. The platform is designed to treat cancerous and benign tumors throughout the body, as well as neurologic disorders. The use of SRS and SBRT with the CyberKnife platform to treat tumors throughout the body has grown significantly in recent years. SRS and SBRT are performed on an outpatient basis in a limited number of treatment sessions - typically 1-5 fractions. They enable the treatment of patients who might not otherwise be treated with radiation, who may not be good candidates for surgery, or who desire a non-surgical treatment option.\nThe CyberKnife S7 System includes disease-specific tracking and treatment delivery solutions for brain, spine, lung and prostate tumors, improvements in treatment speed as compared to earlier systems, more options to configure the treatment room, and expanded number of nodes leading to more coverage and minimizing dose to healthy tissue. The system has the option of fixed collimators plus the Iris Variable Aperture Collimator and/or InCise Multileaf Collimator (MLC). With the addition of the InCise MLC, the CyberKnife S7 System enables treatment of larger tumors previously thought untreatable with radiosurgery and SBRT. The InCise MLC and IMRT planning tools enable expansion of indications that can be treated with a CyberKnife platform to include many IMRT indications.\nUsing our Synchrony\u00ae real-time target tracking with dynamic delivery technology and computer controlled robotic mobility, the CyberKnife platform is designed to deliver radiation from a wide array of beam angles and autonomously track, detect and correct for even the slightest tumor and patient movement in real time throughout the entire treatment. This design is intended to enable the CyberKnife platform to deliver high dose radiation with precision and accuracy, which minimizes damage to surrounding healthy tissue and eliminates the need for invasive head or body immobilization frames.\nThe Accuray Precision\u00ae Treatment Planning System (TPS) with the VOLO Optimizer software on the CyberKnife S7 System enables customers to significantly improve operational efficiency by reducing both the time to create high quality treatment plans and the time it takes to deliver patient treatments. The next-generation TPS with the optimizer facilitates the development of clinically optimal treatment plans up to 90 percent faster than before and the delivery of the treatment up to an estimated 50 percent faster than before the availability of this software.\nWe believe the CyberKnife platform offers clinicians and patients significant benefits over other vendors' radiation therapy systems in the market.\nThe long-term success of the CyberKnife platform is dependent on a number of factors including the following:\n\u2022Continued adoption of our CyberKnife platform, including the CyberKnife M6 System and CyberKnife S7 System, in markets where they are available;\n\u2022Greater awareness among doctors and patients of the benefits of radiosurgery delivered with the CyberKnife platform, including its robotic architecture and Synchrony technology and VOLO optimizer;\n\u2022Continued evolution in clinical studies demonstrating the safety, efficacy and other benefits of using the CyberKnife platform to treat tumors in various parts of the body;\n\u2022Change in medical practice leading to utilization of stereotactic body radiation therapy more regularly as an alternative to surgery or other treatments;\n\u2022Continued advances in our technology that improve the quality of treatments and ease of use of the CyberKnife platform;\n\u2022Receipt of regulatory approvals in various countries which are expected to improve access to radiosurgery with the CyberKnife S7 System in such countries;\n\u2022Medical insurance reimbursement policies that cover CyberKnife platform treatments; and\n\u2022Our ability to expand sales of CyberKnife M6 and S7 Systems in countries throughout the world where we do not currently sell or have not historically sold a significant number of any CyberKnife platform configurations.\nThe Radixact System, the Next-Generation TomoTherapy Platform\nThe Radixact System, the next generation TomoTherapy platform, allows for fully integrated radiation treatment planning, delivery and data management, enabling clinicians to deliver ultra-precise treatments to more than 50 patients per day. The platform's ring gantry architecture enables precise and efficient treatments with a high degree of dose conformity, while the high-speed binary MLC effectively modulates and shapes the radiation beam as it is emitted. The combination of the ring gantry and the MLC enable treatment to be delivered continuously in a 360 degree helical pattern around the patient's body (TomoHelical). Additionally, the TomoDirect feature provides the TomoTherapy platform with added versatility, enabling the delivery of high quality, fixed angle beams. The two treatment delivery modes - TomoHelical and TomoDirect - provide flexibility in the types of indications that can be treated with radiation, from the simplest to the most complex cases, multiple tumors and recurrent tumors.\nOur Synchrony real-time target tracking with dynamic delivery for the Radixact System adds intrafraction motion synchronization capabilities to this device, enabling real-time tracking, visualization and correction for tumor motion during treatment, with the goal of improving dose accuracy and treatment times as compared to conventional radiation therapy systems. Synchrony can be used on the Radixact System to adapt treatment delivery for tumors that move as a result of bodily processes, including respiration and digestion, as well as patient movement. Treatments are truly personalized, as delivery is adapted to the individual's unique movements throughout treatment delivery. If movement changes during treatment, delivery is adapted for that unique change.\nThe Radixact System seamlessly integrates with ClearRT helical kVCT high-fidelity imaging, providing clinicians with an option to produce exceptional diagnostic-like quality CT images, quickly and cost-effectively, to improve patient care. ClearRT imaging provides the largest imaging field of view available on a radiation delivery system at 50 cm (diameter) by 135 cm (long), and speed, as evidenced by its ability to capture a 1-meter image in only 1 minute. ClearRT delivers enhanced imaging capabilities compared to conventional linear accelerator systems that rely on cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging and as an alternative to MR-based radiation therapy systems that can be complex and cost prohibitive to use.\nThe TomoTherapy platform integrates into a single system all of the key elements for radiation therapy, including treatment planning, CT image guided patient positioning, treatment delivery, quality assurance and adaptive planning. The imaging and treatment planning capabilities of many traditional systems are more modular or require cumbersome add ons or separate treatment planning systems that result in clinicians taking more steps between scanning, planning and treatment of patients. Conversely, the integrated imaging and treatment features of the Radixact System allows clinicians to scan, plan and treat cancer patients efficiently. Treatment plans as well as daily images can be easily accessed remotely, enabling clinical teams to collaboratively work together, regardless of location, ensuring higher quality plan development and delivery.\nWe believe the TomoTherapy platform offers clinicians and patients significant benefits over other vendors' radiation therapy systems in the market. The long-term success of the TomoTherapy platform is dependent on a number of factors including the following:\n\u2022Continued adoption of our TomoTherapy platform, including the Radixact System, in markets where it is available;\n\u2022Greater awareness among doctors and patients of the unique benefits of radiation therapy using the TomoTherapy platform, including its ring gantry architecture that enables treatment delivery from multiple 360 degree rotations around the patient, and ClearRT helical kVCT imaging for the Radixact System, designed to produce exceptional diagnostic-like quality CT images, quickly and cost-effectively;\n\u2022Advances in our technology that improve the quality of treatments and ease of use of TomoTherapy platform;\n\u2022Greater awareness among doctors of the now-established reliability of TomoTherapy platform; and\n\u2022Our ability to expand sales of TomoTherapy platform in countries throughout the world where we do not currently sell or have not historically sold a significant number of any TomoTherapy platform configurations.\nSale of Our Products\nGenerating revenue from the sale of our platforms is a lengthy process. Selling our platforms, from first contact with a potential customer to a signed sales contract that meets our backlog criteria (as discussed below) varies significantly and generally spans between six months and two years. The length of time between receipt of a signed contract and revenue recognition is generally governed by the time required by the customer to build, renovate or prepare the treatment room for installation of the platform.\nIn the United States, we primarily market directly to customers, including hospitals and stand-alone treatment facilities, through our sales organization we also market to customers through sales agents and group purchasing organizations. Outside the United States, we market to customers directly and through use of distributors and sales agents. In addition to our offices in the United States, we have sales and service offices in Europe, India, Asia, and South America.\nAs of June 30, 2022, our systems were named in 100 out of 118 Class A user licenses awarded in the 13th five year plan by the China National Health Commission to purchase radiation therapy devices. The Chinese Ministry of Health requires a tender process following the license awards for all participating end user hospitals prior to being able to take receipt of a Class A device. This tender process defines the transactional terms and conditions related to each hospital's equipment order and does not put us in a competitive bidding situation that would result in changes in the specific device for which the hospital has received the Class A user license. During the year ended June 30, 2022, we delivered Class A devices to China and recognized system revenue related to such devices of approximately $65.1 million in the same period. We currently anticipate system revenue related to the remaining Class A user licenses awarded to date in the next 12 to 18 months. Despite the challenges and uncertainties in China and around the world, including those created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to believe that China remains the world's fastest growing market for radiation oncology systems and the pandemic does not affect the long-term demand for radiotherapy equipment in China.\nJoint Venture\nIn January 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Accuray Asia Limited ( Accuray Asia\u201d), entered into an agreement with CNNC High Energy Equipment (Tianjin) Co., Ltd. (the CIRC Subsidiary\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Isotope & Radiation Corporation, to form a joint venture, CNNC Accuray (Tianjin) Medical Technology Co. Ltd. (the JV\u201d), to manufacture and sell radiation oncology systems in China. The JV aims to be uniquely positioned to serve China, which we believe is the world's largest growth market for radiation oncology systems. China represents a significantly underserved market for linacs based on the country's population and cancer incidence rates on both an absolute and relative country basis. Accuray Asia has a 49% ownership interest in the JV and the CIRC Subsidiary has a 51% ownership interest in the JV.\nIn July 2019, the JV broke ground on its facility based in Tianjin, China, which serves as its headquarters and home of its manufacturing, sales organization and service operations. The JV has received its Radiation Safety License from the China Ministry of Environmental Protection, along with its license to do business in China and Medical Device Operating Permit, enabling the JV to sell, install and provide further service to our radiation therapy devices in China. The JV has also completed construction of its manufacturing facility and has obtained the Quality Management System certification with ISO13485 standard.\nWith the receipt of the necessary permits and licenses to operate, the JV has begun selling products in China, much like a distributor. In the long term, we anticipate that the JV will manufacture and sell a locally branded Made in China\u201d radiotherapy device in the Class B license category, or Class B device, which would replace our current offering in that category. We believe this strategy will allow us to best maximize both near and longer-term opportunities in China. Required testing for the Class B device is ongoing and the National Medical Products Administration (\"NMPA\") submission is expected to finish in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022 as the due date has been extended as a result of the COVID-19 travel restrictions.\nWe apply the equity method of accounting to our ownership interest in the JV as we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the JV but lack controlling financial interest and are not the primary beneficiary. We recognize revenue on sales to the JV in the current period, eliminating 49% of profit to the extent goods sold have not been sold through by the JV to an end customer at the end of such reporting period. We deferred $5.4 million and $2.1 million of intra-entity profit margin as of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. During the year ended June 30, 2022, we recognized $1.4 million of previously deferred intra-entity profit margin from sales and recorded intra-entity profit margin deferral of $4.7 million from sales executed during the period. Our consolidated accumulated deficit includes $1.0 million of accumulated gains related to our equity method investment.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we had carrying value of $12.9 million in the JV and owned a 49% interest in the entity. Our proportional share of the underlying equity in net assets of the JV was approximately $14.6 million. The difference between the carrying value of the equity investment and our proportional share of the underlying equity in net assets of the JV of $1.7 million, adding back $5.4 million of eliminated intra-entity profit, constitutes equity method goodwill of $4.7 million at June 30, 2022 that is subject to impairment analysis. No impairment was identified as of June 30, 2022.\nCOVID-19 and Economic Conditions\nIn fiscal year 2020, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19\u201d) was surfaced in Wuhan, China and was subsequently recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world and while conditions have improved, the pace and degree of recovery varies significantly. In response to this pandemic, governments and private industry have taken preventative or protective actions at varying levels, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, which has resulted in the temporary or permanent closure of certain businesses, as well as advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, particularly in group settings. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business operations as well as those of our customers and partners. In addition, across the healthcare industry, resources are being prioritized for the treatment and management of the pandemic and away from non-urgent or elective procedures. Some of our customers, which include hospitals, major academic medical centers, and other related entities, have incurred losses during the COVID-19 pandemic due to significantly reduced patient volume. The public health actions being undertaken to reduce the spread of the virus have created and may continue to create significant disruptions with respect to demand for our products and services; the operating procedures and workflow of our customers, particularly hospitals; our ability to continue to manufacture our products; and the reliability of our supply chain.\nOur financial results have also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in various ways. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to adversely impact the pace at which our backlog converts to revenue in the near-term. This is primarily the result of pandemic-related delays in the timing of deliveries and installations which has adversely affected our revenue. We have experienced such delays in deliveries and installations since the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 and expect that such delays will continue to some degree , which could have a negative impact on our revenue. We have also experienced disruptions in sales and delays in customer payments as a result of changes to and redirection of customer resources to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and closures of customer facilities. We have also received requests from a few customers to extend payment terms or temporarily suspend service and corresponding payment obligations and while we have only received a small number of requests thus far, there can be no guarantee that more customers will not ask for the same. In addition, the global supply chain is continuing to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other geopolitical uncertainty as disruptions in parts of our supply chain have resulted in delays in the receipt of certain components for our products as well as increased pricing pressure for such parts. These ongoing supply chain challenges and heightened logistics costs have affected our gross margins and net income (loss), and our current expectations are that gross margins and net income (loss) will continue to be adversely affected by increased material costs and freight and logistic expenses at least through the remainder of the calendar year of 2022, if not longer. Furthermore, certain parts required for the manufacture and servicing of our products, such as electronic components, are scarce and becoming increasingly difficult to source even at increased prices. If such parts become unavailable to us, we would not be able to manufacture or service our products, which would adversely impact revenue, gross margins, and net income (loss). As a result, we are carefully monitoring the pandemic and related economic impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We intend to continue to execute on our strategic plans and operational initiatives. However, given the uncertainty regarding the spread, severity and potential resurgence of COVID-19, the impact of new COVID-19 variants, vaccination deployment efforts, how long the pandemic and associated health measures will last, as well as the related economic impacts, including supply chain issues and inflation, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K, the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated with any certainty at this time, although the impacts are expected to continue and may significantly affect our business. We expect that the impacts on our customers' business and our business will continue through this period of economic uncertainty as supply chain issues, inflation and other factors continue to worsen or emerge. Accordingly, management is carefully evaluating our liquidity position, communicating with and monitoring the\nactions of our customers and suppliers, and reviewing our near-term financial performance as the uncertainty related to these factors continues to unfold.\nBacklog\nAs of June 30, 2022, backlog totaled $563.7 million, of which $0.2 million represented upgrades sold through service contracts. As of June 30, 2021, backlog totaled $616.4 million.\nIn order for the product portion of a system sales agreement to be counted as backlog, it must meet the following criteria:\n\u2022The contract is properly executed by both the customer and us. A customer purchase order that incorporates the terms of our contract quote will be considered equivalent to a signed and executed contract. The contract has either cleared all its contingencies or contained no contingencies when signed;\n\u2022We have received a minimum deposit or a letter of credit; or the sale is to a customer where a deposit is deemed not necessary or customary (i.e. sale to a government entity, a large hospital, group of hospitals or cancer care group that has sufficient credit, customers with trade-in of existing equipment, sales via tender awards, or indirect channel sales that have signed contracts with end-customers);\n\u2022The specific end customer site has been identified by the customer in the written contract or written amendment; and\n\u2022Less than 2.5 years have passed since the contract met all the criteria above.\nAlthough our backlog includes only contractual agreements with our customers for the purchase of our CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms, including the Radixact Systems and related upgrades, we cannot provide assurance that we will convert backlog into recognized revenue due primarily to factors outside of our control. The amount of backlog recognized into revenue is primarily impacted by three items: cancellations, age-outs and foreign currency fluctuations. Orders could be cancelled for reasons including, without limitation, changes in customers' needs, priorities or financial condition, changes in government or health insurance reimbursement policies, or changes to regulatory requirements. In addition to cancellations, after 2.5 years, if we have not been able to recognize revenue on a contract, we remove the revenue associated with the contract from backlog and the order is considered aged out. Contracts may age-out for many reasons, including but not limited to, inability of the customer to pay, inability of the customer to adapt their facilities to accommodate our products in a timely manner, or inability to timely obtain licenses necessary for customer facilities or operation of our equipment. Our backlog also includes amounts not denominated in U.S. Dollars and therefore fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar as compared to other currencies will impact revenue. Generally, strengthening of the U.S. Dollar will negatively impact revenue. Backlog is stated at historical foreign currency exchange rates, and revenue is released from backlog at current exchange rates, with any difference recorded as a backlog adjustment.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the pace of new orders and the pace at which our backlog converts to revenue in the near-term and we expect this to continue. Although the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact individual markets could vary based on a number of factors, we have seen and expect to continue to see a higher than normal level of age-outs in the coming quarters as a result.\nA summary of gross orders, net orders, and order backlog is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 5: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross orders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>332,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>325,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>377,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net age-outs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(148,869\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(122,132\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81,073\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cancellations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,348\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,119\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13,939\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Currency impacts and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,735\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,746\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net orders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Order backlog at the end of the period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>563,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>616,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>602,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Orders and Book to Bill Ratio\nGross orders are defined as the sum of new orders recorded during the period adjusted for any revisions to existing orders during the period. Our book to bill ratio is defined as gross orders for the period divided by product revenue for the period.\nGross orders increased by $6.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. This was primarily due to an increase in CyberKnife platform orders and upgrades of $8.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively. TomoTherapy platform orders decreased by $5.8 million while upgrades increased by $2.1 million. In addition, gross order activity during the year ended June 30, 2021 was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the Americas region. Our book to bill ratio for June 30, 2022 was 1.5 as compared to 1.8 for June 30, 2021.\nGross orders decreased by $51.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. This was primarily due to a decline in China Class A system orders as the prior year order volume reflected significant pent-up demand from our end users and distributor, which was triggered by the announcement of the China Class A system quotas back in 2018. In addition, gross order activity during the year ended June 30, 2021 was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the Americas region. Accordingly, TomoTherapy platform order and upgrades order volume decreased by $48.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year. CyberKnife platform orders decreased by $5.9 million while upgrades increased by $1.4 million. The decrease in CyberKnife platform orders was primarily due to the normalization of China Class A system orders for the year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to prior fiscal year where we experienced higher volumes of orders due to significant pent-up demand. Our book to bill ratio for June 30, 2021 was 1.8 as compared to 2.3 for June 30, 2020.\nNet Orders\nNet orders are defined as gross orders less cancellations, age-outs, foreign exchange and other adjustments during the period.\nNet orders decreased by $24.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, resulting from an increase in age-outs of $35.0 million and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $7.9 million offset by an increase in age-ins of $8.2 million, an increase in gross orders of $6.3 million, and a decrease in cancellations of $3.8 million.\n\u2022The age-outs for the year ended June 30, 2022 were $183.8 million. There were $34.9 million of age-ins. Age-ins represent orders that previously aged-out but have been recognized as revenue in the current period, compared to $148.8 million of age-outs and $26.6 million of age-ins in the same period last fiscal year.\n\u2022There were $11.3 million of cancellations in year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to $15.1 million of cancellations in the year ended June 30, 2021. Cancellations are outside of our control and are difficult to\nforecast; however, we continue to work closely with our customers to minimize the impact of cancellations on our business.\n\u2022Foreign currency impacts and other adjustments decreased net orders by $4.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to an increase in net orders by $3.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nNet orders decreased by $88.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020, resulting from a decrease of gross orders of $51.4 million, an increase in age-outs of $47.2 million, an increase in cancellations of $1.2 million, partially offset by an increase in age-ins of $6.1 million and a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $4.9 million.\n\u2022The age-outs for the year ended June 30, 2021 were $122.1 million. There were $6.1 million of age-ins. Age-ins represent orders that previously aged-out but have been recognized as revenue in the current period, compared to $81.1 million of age-outs and $20.5 million of age-ins in the same period last fiscal year.\n\u2022There were $15.1 million of cancellations in year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to $13.9 million of cancellations in the year ended June 30, 2020. Cancellations are outside of our control and are difficult to forecast; however, we continue to work closely with our customers to minimize the impact of cancellations on our business.\n\u2022Foreign currency impacts and other adjustments increased net orders by $3.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to a decrease in net orders by $1.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2020.\nIn recent years, the percentage of gross orders received from our distribution partners in the international markets represented 71%, 82%, and 76% of gross orders for fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We anticipate that distributor orders from international markets will continue to represent a significant portion of our gross orders in the foreseeable future. International orders are affected by foreign currency fluctuation as well as government programs that stimulate the purchase of healthcare products, both of which could affect the demand for our products and timing of orders from period to period. In addition, our order-to-revenue conversion cycle for international distributor orders has been generally longer compared to that of direct channel sales and could cause fluctuations in our age-outs from period to period.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal 2022 results compared to 2021 (in thousands, except percentages)\nTable 6: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

See Note 13.\nNet revenue\nProduct Net Revenue\nProduct net revenue increased by $38.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 or 22%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to an increase in unit volume sales due to strong performance in the Americas region due to pent-up demand post-COVID coupled with an increase in system average product revenue. The increase is driven by an increase in revenue from the Americas, EMEA, and China regions offset by a unit volume decline in the Japan region.\nService Net Revenue\nService net revenue decreased by $4.4 million, or 2%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in service contract revenue of $3.6 million driven by the strong US dollar that reduced the dollar value of all foreign currency service contract revenue, primarily in Japan and Europe, slightly offset by an increase in installation revenue.\nNet revenue by geographic region, based on the shipping location of our customer, is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 7: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>429,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>396,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Europe, Middle East, India and Africa\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Asia Pacific, excluding Japan and China\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Japan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>China\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit\nThe overall gross profit for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased by $0.4 million, relatively flat as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, due to an increase in product gross profit of $12.9 million, or 17%, driven by an increase in product revenue as a result of higher shipments offset by a decrease in service gross profit of $12.4 million or 15% driven by $8.0 million increase in service cost mainly due to higher part consumption and $4.4 million lower service revenue.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $5.0 million, or 10%, for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase was driven by an increase of $4.3 million in compensation and employee benefits expenses mainly due to additional headcount and an increase of $1.2 million in outside services offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in operational cost due to a decrease in materials costs for research and development projects.\nSelling and marketing expenses\nSelling and marketing expenses increased $6.8 million, or 16%, for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $4.1 million in compensation and benefits cost due to an increase in headcount, an increase of $2.0 million in marketing expenses due to a greater number of in-person tradeshows as compared to virtual tradeshows in the previous year and an increase of $1.3 million in traveling expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $2.7 million, or 6%, for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.3 million in operating cost due to increases in insurance premiums and higher bad debt expense and an increase of $0.9 million in outside services related to consulting fees and our reinstatement of compensatory fees for our board of directors in fiscal 2022.\nIncome on equity method investment, net\nIncome (loss) on equity method investment was an income of $0.2 million as compared to an income of $0.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2021.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net decreased by $17.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The decrease was primarily related to lower interest cost due to lower interest rates on our debt in fiscal 2022 and the loss on extinguishment of old convertible notes in fiscal 2021. The impact of these items was partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange gain.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was higher in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily driven by a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to undistributed earnings in France, Japan and Switzerland.\nFiscal 2021 results compared to 2020 (in thousands,

increase in unit volume sales coupled with an increase in system average product revenue of $18.8 million. The increase is driven by an increase in revenue from China, offset by a unit volume decline in the Americas, EMEA and Japan regions partly as a result of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic\non revenue conversion timing with our customers in those regions and a decrease in system upgrades of $9.5 million due to the timing of release of ClearRT that was anticipated by customers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nService Net Revenue\nService net revenue increased by $4.0 million, or 2%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to an increase in service contract revenue of $2.8 million, a reduced cost of service of $2.6 million, and an increase in upgrade and installation revenue of $1.8 million, offset by a decrease in training revenue and revenue from service parts.\nNet revenue by geographic region, based on the shipping location of our customer, is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>396,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>382,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Americas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Europe, Middle East, India and Africa\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Asia Pacific, excluding Japan and China\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Japan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>China\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit\nThe overall gross profit for the year ended June 30, 2021 increased by $9.8 million, or 7%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020, due to an increase in service gross profit of $6.7 million, or 9%, driven by an increase in service contract revenue of $4.0 million including, upgrades and installation services, from an increase in the number of installed systems, coupled with a reduced cost of service of $2.6 million and an increase in product gross profit of $3.1 million, or 4%, which was driven by higher revenue from system unit sales volume coupled with an increase in system average product revenue.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $2.9 million, or 6%, for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase was driven by an increase of $2.5 million in compensation and employee benefits expenses mainly due to reinstatement of bonuses to employees in fiscal year 2021, which were suspended in fiscal year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase of $2.2 million in outside services offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in travel expenses due to decreased travel as a result of travel restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and a decrease of $0.5 million in facilities expenses.\nSelling and marketing expenses\nSelling and marketing expenses decreased $4.4 million, or 9%, for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of $3.0 million due to the lower cost of key trade shows that were held virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease of $2.0 million in travel expenses, a decrease of $0.9 million in marketing promotion and materials and $0.2 million lower consulting expense, offset by an increase of $1.7 million in compensation and employee benefits mainly due to the reinstatement of bonuses to employees in fiscal year 2021, which were suspended in fiscal year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $1.6 million, or 4%, for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.6 million in compensation and employee benefits mainly due to the reinstatement of bonuses to employees in fiscal year 2021, which were suspended in fiscal year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase of $1.7 million this fiscal year compared to prior fiscal year due to the conclusion of a foreign indirect tax audit in fiscal year 2020 offset by a decrease in expense for allowance for credit losses of $1.6 million and a decrease in outside services and consulting of $1.2 million.\nIncome on equity method investment, net\nIncome (loss) on equity method investment was an income of $0.9 million as compared to a loss of $0.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net increased by $21.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the non-cash gain of $13.0 million related to the value of the Accuray systems contributed to the JV in exchange for 49% equity interest that was recorded in fiscal year 2020, an increase of $5.7 million due to loss on extinguishment of debt and a $4.3 million due to loss on the exchange of our 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2022 that was treated as an extinguishment of old notes. The impact of these items was offset by an increase of $0.4 million in net foreign currency exchange gain, a decrease of $1.2 million in interest expense and a $0.2 million payment received for building improvements to a facility that was vacated in 2020.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was lower in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to lower foreign earnings in fiscal 2021. We also released income tax benefits in fiscal 2020 related to final tax assessments from the Swiss tax authorities for the fiscal period 2018 that otherwise would have reflected a much higher income tax expense for us in fiscal 2020.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded share-based compensation expense of $10.6 million, $9.3 million, and $8.2 million, respectively, related to awards under our stock incentive plans. Share-based compensation expense was recorded net of estimated forfeitures. As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately $14.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock options, shares under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period from 0.6 to 2.4 years.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt June 30, 2022, we had $88.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates and inflation, world events, including the Russian-Ukraine war, continuing uncertainty associated with COVID-19 and the risks included in Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors.\u201d Also refer to Note 10, Debt to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the New Credit Facilities and the Notes as of June 30, 2022. Based on our cash and cash equivalents balance, available debt facilities, current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that we will have sufficient cash resources and anticipated cash flows to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, we continue to critically review our liquidity and anticipated capital requirements in light of the significant uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn May 2021, we issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 under an indenture between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. $97.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2026 were issued to certain holders of 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2022 in exchange for $82.1 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2022 outstanding and $2.9 million aggregate principal amount were issued for cash. Concurrently, in May 2021, we entered into a senior secured credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, individually as a lender and agent, and\nthe other lenders (the Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides for a new five-year $80 million term loan facility and a $40 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement, including $25 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, were funded on May 14, 2021, and as of June 30, 2022 we had an outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility of $5.0 million.\nOur liquidity and cash flows has been and could continue to be materially impacted by the diversion of customer resources to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as delays in payments from customers and could be further impacted by additional and prolonged delays in payments from customers, the potential risk mitigation measures, facility closures, or other reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic. There remain uncertainties as to how the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to materially impact our liquidity in the future.\nIn addition, we are unable to predict with certainty the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to maintain compliance with the debt covenants contained in the credit and security agreements related to our Credit Facilities, including financial covenants regarding the fixed charge coverage ratio and the consolidated senior net leverage ratio. While we were in compliance with such covenants for the year ended June 30, 2022, failure to meet the covenant requirements in the future could cause us to be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately payable. This may require us to obtain waivers or amendments to the credit and security agreement in order to maintain compliance and there can be no certainty that any such waiver or amendment will be available, or what the cost of such waiver or amendment, if obtained, would be. If we are unable to obtain necessary waivers or amendment and the debt under such credit facility is accelerated, we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates, which may not be favorable to us. There is no guarantee that we would be able to satisfy our obligations if any of our indebtedness is accelerated.\nAdditionally, the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at June 30, 2022 for all countries except Japan, France and Switzerland are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and unavailable for distribution in the form of dividends or otherwise. Repatriation of the Company's foreign earnings from Japan, France and Switzerland are subject to income taxes. As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately $55.1 million of cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries. When such funds are repatriated, there will be additional foreign tax withholdings imposed depending on the country from which the funds were repatriated.\nIn addition, the long sales cycle, together with delays in the shipment of CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms or customer cancellations that have increased in light of the COVID-19 pandemic have affected our ability to recognize revenue, which could adversely affect our cash flows.\nCash Flows\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,400\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,469\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,717\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,399\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,728\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,369\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,805\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash\nequivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,561\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,047\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted our global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets all of which could negatively impact our business operations and cash flows for the foreseeable future, including reductions in revenue and delays in payments from customers. The challenges posed by COVID-19 on our business are expected to evolve rapidly. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption and volatility in the financial markets, could materially affect our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $2.4 million in fiscal 2022, resulting primarily from changes in working capital of $22.6 million and a net loss of $5.3 million offset by $25.5 million of non cash items.\n\u2022The net change in working capital was primarily due to increases of $22.9 million in inventories, $12.5 million in accounts receivable, $6.0 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, and decreases of $0.8 million in operating lease liabilities and $1.4 million in deferred revenues, offset by increases of $11.7 million in accounts payable, $6.7 million in accrued liabilities, $1.2 million in customer advances and decrease of $1.5 million in deferred costs.\n\u2022Non-cash items primarily consisted of

investment of $0.1 million;\n\u2022The net change in operating assets and liabilities of $21.2 million was primarily due to an increase of $23.2 million in inventories due to slower than anticipated conversion of our order backlog to revenue, a decrease of $16.6 million in compensation related accrued liabilities and reduction in bonus accrual, a decrease of $6.8 million in accounts payable and a decrease of $0.2 million in net operating lease liabilities offset by receivable collection and a decrease in accounts receivable of $19.0 million, a decrease of $4.4 million in prepaid expense and other assets and an increase of $1.5 million in customer advances, deferred revenue and deferred cost of revenue.\nCash Flows From Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $4.7 million in fiscal 2022, which primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment of $4.7 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.4 million in fiscal 2021, which primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment of $2.3 million and an additional investment in the JV of $0.1 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $3.7 million in fiscal 2020, which primarily consisted of purchases of property and equipment.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2022 was $15.4 million, which was primarily due to $15.0 million of repayments under Revolving Credit Facility and $4.0 million paydown in debt offset by $2.3 million in proceeds from employee stock plans and proceeds from options exercises.\nNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2021 was $28.8 million, primarily due to the repayment of all outstanding obligations and termination of the Prior Revolving Credit Facility and Prior Term Loan of $105.4 million, the prepayment during the year of $10.0 million of the principal amount outstanding on our Prior Term Loan, the amendment fee of $0.5 million related to our Prior Credit Facilities, the repurchase of our common stock of $14.1 million, the paydown on our New Revolving Credit Facility of $5.0 million, $0.1 million net cost related to the exchange of our 3.75% Convertible Notes 3.75% due 2022 for our 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2026 and $0.3 million in taxes paid related to net settlement of equity awards, offset by net proceeds from New Revolving Credit Facility and New Term Loan Facility of $103.7 million, proceeds from employee stock plans of $2.2 million and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $0.9 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2020 was $26.7 million, which was primarily due to a net draw of $24.7 million, net, drawn against our Prior Term Loan Facility and $2.5 million in proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan offset by $0.3 million, net repayments under our Prior Revolving Credit Facility and $0.2 million in taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards.\nOperating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nOur future capital requirements depend on numerous factors. These factors include but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022Revenue generated by sales of our products and service plans;\n\u2022Our ability to generate cash flows from operations;\n\u2022Costs associated with our sales and marketing initiatives and manufacturing activities;\n\u2022Facilities, equipment and IT systems required to support current and future operations;\n\u2022Rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities;\n\u2022Costs of obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory clearances of our products;\n\u2022Effects of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022Number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\n\u2022Servicing and maturity of our current future indebtedness;\n\u2022The impact of inflation of our expenses; and\n\u2022The unpredictable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on collections, supply chains and logistics.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents balance will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. If these sources of cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, or we believe market conditions are favorable, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or enter into additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional financing may not be available at all, or in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain this additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements and Contractual Obligations\nOur purchase commitments and obligations include all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services and acquisition and licensing of intellectual property. A majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. Our long-term material cash requirements include lease obligations. See Note 5. Leases.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt June 30, 2022 we had open currency forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies with a stated, or notional, value of approximately $68.3 million. The fair value of the underlying currency based upon the June 30, 2022 exchange rate was approximately $68.3 million. At June 30, 2021 we had open currency forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies with a stated, or notional, value of approximately $54.2 million. The fair value of the underlying currency based upon the June 30, 2022 exchange rate was approximately $54.2 million. We did not have any off balance sheet arrangements for the year ended June 30, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. However, the economic uncertainty in the current environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could limit our ability to accurately make and evaluate our estimates and judgments. Actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates if actual conditions differ from our assumptions.\nAll of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1, The Company and its Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Management believes the critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, assessment of recoverability of goodwill, valuation of inventories, convertible notes, impairment of investments and allowance for credit losses.\nConcentration of Credit and Other Risks\nOur cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several major financial institutions. At times, deposits in these institutions exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. We have not experienced any losses in such accounts and do not believe that we are exposed to any significant risk of loss on these balances.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022 there was one customer that represented 10% or more of total net revenue and for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, there were one and no customers, respectively, that represented 10% or more of total net revenue. We had two customers as of June 30, 2022 and two customers as of June 30, 2021, respectively, that each accounted for more than 10% of our total accounts receivable, net.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain reserves for potential credit losses. Accounts receivable are deemed past due in accordance with the contractual terms of the agreement. Accounts receivable balances are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once collection efforts are unsuccessful.\nSingle-source suppliers presently provide us with several components. In most cases, if a supplier was unable to deliver these components, we believe that we would be able to find other sources for these components subject to any regulatory qualifications, if required.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is primarily derived from sales of CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms and services, which include PCS contracts (warranty period services and post-warranty services), installation services, training and other professional services. We record our revenue net of any value added or sales tax. We recognize revenue for certain performance obligations at the point in time when control is transferred, such as delivery of products. We recognize revenue for certain other performance obligations over a period of time as control of the goods or services is transferred, such as PCS and construction contracts. Payments received in advance of system shipment are recorded as customer advances and are deferred until product shipment when they are recognized in revenue. We assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer. We generally do not request collateral from our customers.\nWe frequently enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple performance obligations. For sale arrangements that contain multiple performance obligations, we account for individual products and services separately if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on relative its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The stand-alone selling price ( SSP\u201d). The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which we separately sell the products and services. If a SSP is not directly observable, then we will estimate the SSP considering market conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.\nProduct Revenue\nThe majority of product revenue is generated from sales of CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms, including Radixact Systems. Revenue is recognized once the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product to a customer, which is generally upon delivery.\nWe record revenue from sales of systems, product upgrades and accessories to our customers based on the general terms and conditions of the executed sales and distribution agreements as well as the specific terms and conditions executed for each sale, and once the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product to a customer.\nWe record revenue considering all discounts given to, or expected by, customers. As a result, management may make estimates of potential future product returns or trade ins and other allowances related to product revenue in the current period. In general, we do not allow returns from customers and all discounts and allowances are clearly identified in the terms and conditions of each sale. We derive some product revenue from sales to the JV.\nService Revenue\nService revenue is generated primarily from PCS, installation services, training and professional services. Service revenue is recognized either ratably over the contractual period as control and benefit transfer to the customer or when service is performed, depending on specific terms and conditions in agreements with customers. We derive some service revenue from sales to the JV.\nCosts associated with service revenue are expensed when incurred, except when those costs are related to system upgrades purchased within a service contract. In those cases, the costs of such upgrades are recognized at the time control and benefit of the upgrade transfers to the customer.\nAssessment of Recoverability of Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identified intangible net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis and when impairment indicators are present. We have one operating segment and one reporting unit. Therefore, our consolidated net assets, including existing goodwill are considered to be the carrying value of the reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on the closing price of our common stock on the trading day closest to the annual review date multiplied by the outstanding shares on that date. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is in excess of its fair value, an impairment may exist, and we must perform the second step of the analysis, in which the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to its carrying value to determine the impairment charge, if any. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required.\nValuation of Inventories\nThe valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as damaged inventory. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of product demand to support future sales and service. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce purchasing and manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory beyond the current reserve, which would negatively impact our gross margin.\nConvertible Notes\nWe account for convertible notes in accordance with applicable guidance which specifies that an issuer of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity component of the conversion option. The amount recorded as debt is based on the fair value of the debt component as a standalone instrument, determined based on an implied credit spread interest rate for nonconvertible debt. This implied credit spread was derived from the trading history of our convertible notes and a range of estimated market volatility. The difference between the debt recorded at inception and its principal amount is accreted to principal during the estimated life of the note. ASC 470-50, provides guidance on modifications to or exchanges of line-of-credit or revolving arrangements which should be evaluated based on borrowing. We adopted ASU 2020-06 in fiscal year 2022, using the modified retrospective method, which no longer accounts for the liability and equity component separately.\nImpairment of Investments\nWe have an equity investment in CNNC Accuray (Tianjin) Medical Technologies Co. Ltd., the Company's joint venture in China. The Company's equity method investment is held at cost and adjusted for impairment when it would be deemed to be impaired. We monitor this investment for events or circumstances indicative of a potential\nimpairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying value if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition or near term prospects of the investee.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers prior to authorizing shipment for all major sale transactions. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. If our evaluation of our customers' financial conditions does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions may be needed and our operating results could be negatively affected.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K, particularly in Risk Factors.\u201d See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nCompany\nAccuray Incorporated is a radiation therapy company that develops, manufactures, sells and supports market-changing solutions that are designed to deliver radiation treatments for even the most complex cases, while making commonly treatable cases even more straightforward, to meet the full spectrum of patient needs. We believe in comparison to conventional linear accelerators, our treatment delivery, planning, and data management solutions provide better accuracy, flexibility, and control; fewer treatments with shorter treatment times; and the technology to expand beyond cancer, making it easier for clinical teams around the world to provide treatments that help patients get back to living their lives, faster.\nOur innovative technologies, the CyberKnife\u00ae and TomoTherapy\u00ae platforms, including the Radixact\u00ae System, our next generation TomoTherapy platform, are designed to deliver advanced treatments, including stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), and adaptive radiation therapy (ART). The CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms have complementary clinical applications with the same goal: to empower our customers to deliver the most precise and accurate treatments while still minimizing dose to healthy tissue, helping to reduce the risk of side effects that may impact patients' quality of life. Each of these systems serves patient populations treated by the same medical specialty, radiation oncology, with advanced capabilities. The CyberKnife platform is also used by neurosurgeons specializing in radiosurgery to treat patients with tumors in the brain and spine, and neurologic disorders. In addition to these products, we also provide services, which include post-contract customer support (warranty period services and post warranty services), installation services, training, and other professional services.\nThe CyberKnife Platform\nThe CyberKnife platform is the only robotic, full-body stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivery device on the market. The latest generation is the CyberKnife S7 System, which combines speed, advanced precision, and real-time artificial intelligence (AI)-driven motion tracking and synchronized treatment delivery for all SRS and SBRT treatments, in as little as 15 minutes. The platform is designed to treat cancerous and benign tumors throughout the body, as well as neurologic disorders. The use of SRS and SBRT with the CyberKnife platform to treat tumors throughout the body has grown significantly in recent years. SRS and SBRT are performed on an outpatient basis in a limited number of treatment sessions - typically 1-5 fractions. They enable the treatment of patients who might not otherwise be treated with radiation, who may not be good candidates for surgery, or who desire a non-surgical treatment option.\nThe CyberKnife S7 System includes disease-specific tracking and treatment delivery solutions for brain, spine, lung and prostate tumors, improvements in treatment speed as compared to earlier systems, more options to configure the treatment room, and expanded number of nodes leading to more coverage and minimizing dose to healthy tissue. The system has the option of fixed collimators plus the Iris Variable Aperture Collimator and/or InCise Multileaf Collimator (MLC). With the addition of the InCise MLC, the CyberKnife S7 System enables treatment of larger tumors previously thought untreatable with radiosurgery and SBRT. The InCise MLC and IMRT planning tools enable expansion of indications that can be treated with a CyberKnife platform to include many IMRT indications.\nUsing our Synchrony\u00ae real-time target tracking with dynamic delivery technology and computer controlled robotic mobility, the CyberKnife platform is designed to deliver radiation from a wide array of beam angles and autonomously track, detect and correct for even the slightest tumor and patient movement in real time throughout the entire treatment. This design is intended to enable the CyberKnife platform to deliver high dose radiation with precision and accuracy, which minimizes damage to surrounding healthy tissue and eliminates the need for invasive head or body immobilization frames.\nThe Accuray Precision\u00ae Treatment Planning System (TPS) with the VOLO Optimizer software on the CyberKnife S7 System enables customers to significantly improve operational efficiency by reducing both the time to create high quality treatment plans and the time it takes to deliver patient treatments. The next-generation TPS with the optimizer facilitates the development of clinically optimal treatment plans up to 90 percent faster than before and the delivery of the treatment up to an estimated 50 percent faster than before the availability of this software.\nWe believe the CyberKnife platform offers clinicians and patients significant benefits over other vendors' radiation therapy systems in the market.\nThe long-term success of the CyberKnife platform is dependent on a number of factors including the following:\n\u2022Continued adoption of our CyberKnife platform, including the CyberKnife M6 System and CyberKnife S7 System, in markets where they are available;\n\u2022Greater awareness among doctors and patients of the benefits of radiosurgery delivered with the CyberKnife platform, including its robotic architecture and Synchrony technology and VOLO optimizer;\n\u2022Continued evolution in clinical studies demonstrating the safety, efficacy and other benefits of using the CyberKnife platform to treat tumors in various parts of the body;\n\u2022Change in medical practice leading to utilization of stereotactic body radiation therapy more regularly as an alternative to surgery or other treatments;\n\u2022Continued advances in our technology that improve the quality of treatments and ease of use of the CyberKnife platform;\n\u2022Receipt of regulatory approvals in various countries which are expected to improve access to radiosurgery with the CyberKnife S7 System in such countries;\n\u2022Medical insurance reimbursement policies that cover CyberKnife platform treatments; and\n\u2022Our ability to expand sales of CyberKnife M6 and S7 Systems in countries throughout the world where we do not currently sell or have not historically sold a significant number of any CyberKnife platform configurations.\nThe Radixact System, the Next-Generation TomoTherapy Platform\nThe Radixact System, the next generation TomoTherapy platform, allows for fully integrated radiation treatment planning, delivery and data management, enabling clinicians to deliver ultra-precise treatments to more than 50 patients per day. The platform's ring gantry architecture enables precise and efficient treatments with a high degree of dose conformity, while the high-speed binary MLC effectively modulates and shapes the radiation beam as it is emitted. The combination of the ring gantry and the MLC enable treatment to be delivered continuously in a 360 degree helical pattern around the patient's body (TomoHelical). Additionally, the TomoDirect feature provides the TomoTherapy platform with added versatility, enabling the delivery of high quality, fixed angle beams. The two treatment delivery modes - TomoHelical and TomoDirect - provide flexibility in the types of indications that can be treated with radiation, from the simplest to the most complex cases, multiple tumors and recurrent tumors.\nOur Synchrony real-time target tracking with dynamic delivery for the Radixact System adds intrafraction motion synchronization capabilities to this device, enabling real-time tracking, visualization and correction for tumor motion during treatment, with the goal of improving dose accuracy and treatment times as compared to conventional radiation therapy systems. Synchrony can be used on the Radixact System to adapt treatment delivery for tumors that move as a result of bodily processes, including respiration and digestion, as well as patient movement. Treatments are truly personalized, as delivery is adapted to the individual's unique movements throughout treatment delivery. If movement changes during treatment, delivery is adapted for that unique change.\nThe Radixact System seamlessly integrates with ClearRT helical kVCT high-fidelity imaging, providing clinicians with an option to produce exceptional diagnostic-like quality CT images, quickly and cost-effectively, to improve patient care. ClearRT imaging provides the largest imaging field of view available on a radiation delivery system at 50 cm (diameter) by 135 cm (long), and speed, as evidenced by its ability to capture a 1-meter image in only 1 minute. ClearRT delivers enhanced imaging capabilities compared to conventional linear accelerator systems that rely on cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging and as an alternative to MR-based radiation therapy systems that can be complex and cost prohibitive to use.\nThe TomoTherapy platform integrates into a single system all of the key elements for radiation therapy, including treatment planning, CT image guided patient positioning, treatment delivery, quality assurance and adaptive planning. The imaging and treatment planning capabilities of many traditional systems are more modular or require cumbersome add ons or separate treatment planning systems that result in clinicians taking more steps between scanning, planning and treatment of patients. Conversely, the integrated imaging and treatment features of the Radixact System allows clinicians to scan, plan and treat cancer patients efficiently. Treatment plans as well as daily images can be easily accessed remotely, enabling clinical teams to collaboratively work together, regardless of location, ensuring higher quality plan development and delivery.\nWe believe the TomoTherapy platform offers clinicians and patients significant benefits over other vendors' radiation therapy systems in the market. The long-term success of the TomoTherapy platform is dependent on a number of factors including the following:\n\u2022Continued adoption of our TomoTherapy platform, including the Radixact System, in markets where it is available;\n\u2022Greater awareness among doctors and patients of the unique benefits of radiation therapy using the TomoTherapy platform, including its ring gantry architecture that enables treatment delivery from multiple 360 degree rotations around the patient, and ClearRT helical kVCT imaging for the Radixact System, designed to produce exceptional diagnostic-like quality CT images, quickly and cost-effectively;\n\u2022Advances in our technology that improve the quality of treatments and ease of use of TomoTherapy platform;\n\u2022Greater awareness among doctors of the now-established reliability of TomoTherapy platform; and\n\u2022Our ability to expand sales of TomoTherapy platform in countries throughout the world where we do not currently sell or have not historically sold a significant number of any TomoTherapy platform configurations.\nSale of Our Products\nGenerating revenue from the sale of our platforms is a lengthy process. Selling our platforms, from first contact with a potential customer to a signed sales contract that meets our backlog criteria (as discussed below) varies significantly and generally spans between six months and two years. The length of time between receipt of a signed contract and revenue recognition is generally governed by the time required by the customer to build, renovate or prepare the treatment room for installation of the platform.\nIn the United States, we primarily market directly to customers, including hospitals and stand-alone treatment facilities, through our sales organization we also market to customers through sales agents and group purchasing organizations. Outside the United States, we market to customers directly and through use of distributors and sales agents. In addition to our offices in the United States, we have sales and service offices in Europe, India, Asia, and South America.\nAs of June 30, 2022, our systems were named in 100 out of 118 Class A user licenses awarded in the 13th five year plan by the China National Health Commission to purchase radiation therapy devices. The Chinese Ministry of Health requires a tender process following the license awards for all participating end user hospitals prior to being able to take receipt of a Class A device. This tender process defines the transactional terms and conditions related to each hospital's equipment order and does not put us in a competitive bidding situation that would result in changes in the specific device for which the hospital has received the Class A user license. During the year ended June 30, 2022, we delivered Class A devices to China and recognized system revenue related to such devices of approximately $65.1 million in the same period. We currently anticipate system revenue related to the remaining Class A user licenses awarded to date in the next 12 to 18 months. Despite the challenges and uncertainties in China and around the world, including those created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to believe that China remains the world's fastest growing market for radiation oncology systems and the pandemic does not affect the long-term demand for radiotherapy equipment in China.\nJoint Venture\nIn January 2019, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Accuray Asia Limited ( Accuray Asia\u201d), entered into an agreement with CNNC High Energy Equipment (Tianjin) Co., Ltd. (the CIRC Subsidiary\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Isotope & Radiation Corporation, to form a joint venture, CNNC Accuray (Tianjin) Medical Technology Co. Ltd. (the JV\u201d), to manufacture and sell radiation oncology systems in China. The JV aims to be uniquely positioned to serve China, which we believe is the world's largest growth market for radiation oncology systems. China represents a significantly underserved market for linacs based on the country's population and cancer incidence rates on both an absolute and relative country basis. Accuray Asia has a 49% ownership interest in the JV and the CIRC Subsidiary has a 51% ownership interest in the JV.\nIn July 2019, the JV broke ground on its facility based in Tianjin, China, which serves as its headquarters and home of its manufacturing, sales organization and service operations. The JV has received its Radiation Safety License from the China Ministry of Environmental Protection, along with its license to do business in China and Medical Device Operating Permit, enabling the JV to sell, install and provide further service to our radiation therapy devices in China. The JV has also completed construction of its manufacturing facility and has obtained the Quality Management System certification with ISO13485 standard.\nWith the receipt of the necessary permits and licenses to operate, the JV has begun selling products in China, much like a distributor. In the long term, we anticipate that the JV will manufacture and sell a locally branded Made in China\u201d radiotherapy device in the Class B license category, or Class B device, which would replace our current offering in that category. We believe this strategy will allow us to best maximize both near and longer-term opportunities in China. Required testing for the Class B device is ongoing and the National Medical Products Administration (\"NMPA\") submission is expected to finish in the fourth calendar quarter of 2022 as the due date has been extended as a result of the COVID-19 travel restrictions.\nWe apply the equity method of accounting to our ownership interest in the JV as we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the JV but lack controlling financial interest and are not the primary beneficiary. We recognize revenue on sales to the JV in the current period, eliminating 49% of profit to the extent goods sold have not been sold through by the JV to an end customer at the end of such reporting period. We deferred $5.4 million and $2.1 million of intra-entity profit margin as of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. During the year ended June 30, 2022, we recognized $1.4 million of previously deferred intra-entity profit margin from sales and recorded intra-entity profit margin deferral of $4.7 million from sales executed during the period. Our consolidated accumulated deficit includes $1.0 million of accumulated gains related to our equity method investment.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we had carrying value of $12.9 million in the JV and owned a 49% interest in the entity. Our proportional share of the underlying equity in net assets of the JV was approximately $14.6 million. The difference between the carrying value of the equity investment and our proportional share of the underlying equity in net assets of the JV of $1.7 million, adding back $5.4 million of eliminated intra-entity profit, constitutes equity method goodwill of $4.7 million at June 30, 2022 that is subject to impairment analysis. No impairment was identified as of June 30, 2022.\nCOVID-19 and Economic Conditions\nIn fiscal year 2020, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19\u201d) was surfaced in Wuhan, China and was subsequently recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world and while conditions have improved, the pace and degree of recovery varies significantly. In response to this pandemic, governments and private industry have taken preventative or protective actions at varying levels, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, which has resulted in the temporary or permanent closure of certain businesses, as well as advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes, particularly in group settings. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business operations as well as those of our customers and partners. In addition, across the healthcare industry, resources are being prioritized for the treatment and management of the pandemic and away from non-urgent or elective procedures. Some of our customers, which include hospitals, major academic medical centers, and other related entities, have incurred losses during the COVID-19 pandemic due to significantly reduced patient volume. The public health actions being undertaken to reduce the spread of the virus have created and may continue to create significant disruptions with respect to demand for our products and services; the operating procedures and workflow of our customers, particularly hospitals; our ability to continue to manufacture our products; and the reliability of our supply chain.\nOur financial results have also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in various ways. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to adversely impact the pace at which our backlog converts to revenue in the near-term. This is primarily the result of pandemic-related delays in the timing of deliveries and installations which has adversely affected our revenue. We have experienced such delays in deliveries and installations since the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 and expect that such delays will continue to some degree , which could have a negative impact on our revenue. We have also experienced disruptions in sales and delays in customer payments as a result of changes to and redirection of customer resources to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and closures of customer facilities. We have also received requests from a few customers to extend payment terms or temporarily suspend service and corresponding payment obligations and while we have only received a small number of requests thus far, there can be no guarantee that more customers will not ask for the same. In addition, the global supply chain is continuing to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other geopolitical uncertainty as disruptions in parts of our supply chain have resulted in delays in the receipt of certain components for our products as well as increased pricing pressure for such parts. These ongoing supply chain challenges and heightened logistics costs have affected our gross margins and net income (loss), and our current expectations are that gross margins and net income (loss) will continue to be adversely affected by increased material costs and freight and logistic expenses at least through the remainder of the calendar year of 2022, if not longer. Furthermore, certain parts required for the manufacture and servicing of our products, such as electronic components, are scarce and becoming increasingly difficult to source even at increased prices. If such parts become unavailable to us, we would not be able to manufacture or service our products, which would adversely impact revenue, gross margins, and net income (loss). As a result, we are carefully monitoring the pandemic and related economic impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We intend to continue to execute on our strategic plans and operational initiatives. However, given the uncertainty regarding the spread, severity and potential resurgence of COVID-19, the impact of new COVID-19 variants, vaccination deployment efforts, how long the pandemic and associated health measures will last, as well as the related economic impacts, including supply chain issues and inflation, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K, the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated with any certainty at this time, although the impacts are expected to continue and may significantly affect our business. We expect that the impacts on our customers' business and our business will continue through this period of economic uncertainty as supply chain issues, inflation and other factors continue to worsen or emerge. Accordingly, management is carefully evaluating our liquidity position, communicating with and monitoring the\nactions of our customers and suppliers, and reviewing our near-term financial performance as the uncertainty related to these factors continues to unfold.\nBacklog\nAs of June 30, 2022, backlog totaled $563.7 million, of which $0.2 million represented upgrades sold through service contracts. As of June 30, 2021, backlog totaled $616.4 million.\nIn order for the product portion of a system sales agreement to be counted as backlog, it must meet the following criteria:\n\u2022The contract is properly executed by both the customer and us. A customer purchase order that incorporates the terms of our contract quote will be considered equivalent to a signed and executed contract. The contract has either cleared all its contingencies or contained no contingencies when signed;\n\u2022We have received a minimum deposit or a letter of credit; or the sale is to a customer where a deposit is deemed not necessary or customary (i.e. sale to a government entity, a large hospital, group of hospitals or cancer care group that has sufficient credit, customers with trade-in of existing equipment, sales via tender awards, or indirect channel sales that have signed contracts with end-customers);\n\u2022The specific end customer site has been identified by the customer in the written contract or written amendment; and\n\u2022Less than 2.5 years have passed since the contract met all the criteria above.\nAlthough our backlog includes only contractual agreements with our customers for the purchase of our CyberKnife or TomoTherapy platforms, including the Radixact Systems and related upgrades, we cannot provide assurance that we will convert backlog into recognized revenue due primarily to factors outside of our control. The amount of backlog recognized into revenue is primarily impacted by three items: cancellations, age-outs and foreign currency fluctuations. Orders could be cancelled for reasons including, without limitation, changes in customers' needs, priorities or financial condition, changes in government or health insurance reimbursement policies, or changes to regulatory requirements. In addition to cancellations, after 2.5 years, if we have not been able to recognize revenue on a contract, we remove the revenue associated with the contract from backlog and the order is considered aged out. Contracts may age-out for many reasons, including but not limited to, inability of the customer to pay, inability of the customer to adapt their facilities to accommodate our products in a timely manner, or inability to timely obtain licenses necessary for customer facilities or operation of our equipment. Our backlog also includes amounts not denominated in U.S. Dollars and therefore fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar as compared to other currencies will impact revenue. Generally, strengthening of the U.S. Dollar will negatively impact revenue. Backlog is stated at historical foreign currency exchange rates, and revenue is released from backlog at current exchange rates, with any difference recorded as a backlog adjustment.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the pace of new orders and the pace at which our backlog converts to revenue in the near-term and we expect this to continue. Although the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact individual markets could vary based on a number of factors, we have seen and expect to continue to see a higher than normal level of age-outs in the coming quarters as a result.\nA summary of gross orders, net orders, and order backlog is as follows (in thousands):\n\nGross Orders and Book to Bill Ratio\nGross orders are defined as the sum of new orders recorded during the period adjusted for any revisions to existing orders during the period. Our book to bill ratio is defined as gross orders for the period divided by product revenue for the period.\nGross orders increased by $6.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. This was primarily due to an increase in CyberKnife platform orders and upgrades of $8.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively. TomoTherapy platform orders decreased by $5.8 million while upgrades increased by $2.1 million. In addition, gross order activity during the year ended June 30, 2021 was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the Americas region. Our book to bill ratio for June 30, 2022 was 1.5 as compared to 1.8 for June 30, 2021.\nGross orders decreased by $51.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. This was primarily due to a decline in China Class A system orders as the prior year order volume reflected significant pent-up demand from our end users and distributor, which was triggered by the announcement of the China Class A system quotas back in 2018. In addition, gross order activity during the year ended June 30, 2021 was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the Americas region. Accordingly, TomoTherapy platform order and upgrades order volume decreased by $48.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year. CyberKnife platform orders decreased by $5.9 million while upgrades increased by $1.4 million. The decrease in CyberKnife platform orders was primarily due to the normalization of China Class A system orders for the year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to prior fiscal year where we experienced higher volumes of orders due to significant pent-up demand. Our book to bill ratio for June 30, 2021 was 1.8 as compared to 2.3 for June 30, 2020.\nNet Orders\nNet orders are defined as gross orders less cancellations, age-outs, foreign exchange and other adjustments during the period.\nNet orders decreased by $24.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, resulting from an increase in age-outs of $35.0 million and an unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $7.9 million offset by an increase in age-ins of $8.2 million, an increase in gross orders of $6.3 million, and a decrease in cancellations of $3.8 million.\n\u2022The age-outs for the year ended June 30, 2022 were $183.8 million. There were $34.9 million of age-ins. Age-ins represent orders that previously aged-out but have been recognized as revenue in the current period, compared to $148.8 million of age-outs and $26.6 million of age-ins in the same period last fiscal year.\n\u2022There were $11.3 million of cancellations in year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to $15.1 million of cancellations in the year ended June 30, 2021. Cancellations are outside of our control and are difficult to\nforecast; however, we continue to work closely with our customers to minimize the impact of cancellations on our business.\n\u2022Foreign currency impacts and other adjustments decreased net orders by $4.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to an increase in net orders by $3.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nNet orders decreased by $88.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020, resulting from a decrease of gross orders of $51.4 million, an increase in age-outs of $47.2 million, an increase in cancellations of $1.2 million, partially offset by an increase in age-ins of $6.1 million and a favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $4.9 million.\n\u2022The age-outs for the year ended June 30, 2021 were $122.1 million. There were $6.1 million of age-ins. Age-ins represent orders that previously aged-out but have been recognized as revenue in the current period, compared to $81.1 million of age-outs and $20.5 million of age-ins in the same period last fiscal year.\n\u2022There were $15.1 million of cancellations in year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to $13.9 million of cancellations in the year ended June 30, 2020. Cancellations are outside of our control and are difficult to forecast; however, we continue to work closely with our customers to minimize the impact of cancellations on our business.\n\u2022Foreign currency impacts and other adjustments increased net orders by $3.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to a decrease in net orders by $1.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2020.\nIn recent years, the percentage of gross orders received from our distribution partners in the international markets represented 71%, 82%, and 76% of gross orders for fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We anticipate that distributor orders from international markets will continue to represent a significant portion of our gross orders in the foreseeable future. International orders are affected by foreign currency fluctuation as well as government programs that stimulate the purchase of healthcare products, both of which could affect the demand for our products and timing of orders from period to period. In addition, our order-to-revenue conversion cycle for international distributor orders has been generally longer compared to that of direct channel sales and could cause fluctuations in our age-outs from period to period.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal 2022 results compared to 2021 (in thousands, except percentages)\n\n(*) Expressed as a percentage of total net revenue, except for product and services gross profits which are expressed as a percentage of related product and services revenue.\n(a)Includes sales to the JV, an equity method investment of $55,877 and $24,393 for fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See Note 13.\nNet revenue\nProduct Net Revenue\nProduct net revenue increased by $38.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 or 22%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to an increase in unit volume sales due to strong performance in the Americas region due to pent-up demand post-COVID coupled with an increase in system average product revenue. The increase is driven by an increase in revenue from the Americas, EMEA, and China regions offset by a unit volume decline in the Japan region.\nService Net Revenue\nService net revenue decreased by $4.4 million, or 2%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in service contract revenue of $3.6 million driven by the strong US dollar that reduced the dollar value of all foreign currency service contract revenue, primarily in Japan and Europe, slightly offset by an increase in installation revenue.\nNet revenue by geographic region, based on the shipping location of our customer, is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nGross profit\nThe overall gross profit for the year ended June 30, 2022 increased by $0.4 million, relatively flat as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, due to an increase in product gross profit of $12.9 million, or 17%, driven by an increase in product revenue as a result of higher shipments offset by a decrease in service gross profit of $12.4 million or 15% driven by $8.0 million increase in service cost mainly due to higher part consumption and $4.4 million lower service revenue.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $5.0 million, or 10%, for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase was driven by an increase of $4.3 million in compensation and employee benefits expenses mainly due to additional headcount and an increase of $1.2 million in outside services offset by a decrease of $0.5 million in operational cost due to a decrease in materials costs for research and development projects.\nSelling and marketing expenses\nSelling and marketing expenses increased $6.8 million, or 16%, for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $4.1 million in compensation and benefits cost due to an increase in headcount, an increase of $2.0 million in marketing expenses due to a greater number of in-person tradeshows as compared to virtual tradeshows in the previous year and an increase of $1.3 million in traveling expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $2.7 million, or 6%, for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $1.3 million in operating cost due to increases in insurance premiums and higher bad debt expense and an increase of $0.9 million in outside services related to consulting fees and our reinstatement of compensatory fees for our board of directors in fiscal 2022.\nIncome on equity method investment, net\nIncome (loss) on equity method investment was an income of $0.2 million as compared to an income of $0.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2021.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net decreased by $17.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The decrease was primarily related to lower interest cost due to lower interest rates on our debt in fiscal 2022 and the loss on extinguishment of old convertible notes in fiscal 2021. The impact of these items was partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange gain.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was higher in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily driven by a change in our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to undistributed earnings in France, Japan and Switzerland.\nFiscal 2021 results compared to 2020 (in thousands, except percentages)\n\n(*) Expressed as a percentage of total net revenue, except for product and services gross profits which are expressed as a percentage of related product and services revenue.\nNet revenue\nProduct Net Revenue\nProduct net revenue increased by $9.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 or 6%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to an increase in unit volume sales coupled with an increase in system average product revenue of $18.8 million. The increase is driven by an increase in revenue from China, offset by a unit volume decline in the Americas, EMEA and Japan regions partly as a result of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic\non revenue conversion timing with our customers in those regions and a decrease in system upgrades of $9.5 million due to the timing of release of ClearRT that was anticipated by customers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nService Net Revenue\nService net revenue increased by $4.0 million, or 2%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to an increase in service contract revenue of $2.8 million, a reduced cost of service of $2.6 million, and an increase in upgrade and installation revenue of $1.8 million, offset by a decrease in training revenue and revenue from service parts.\nNet revenue by geographic region, based on the shipping location of our customer, is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nGross profit\nThe overall gross profit for the year ended June 30, 2021 increased by $9.8 million, or 7%, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020, due to an increase in service gross profit of $6.7 million, or 9%, driven by an increase in service contract revenue of $4.0 million including, upgrades and installation services, from an increase in the number of installed systems, coupled with a reduced cost of service of $2.6 million and an increase in product gross profit of $3.1 million, or 4%, which was driven by higher revenue from system unit sales volume coupled with an increase in system average product revenue.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $2.9 million, or 6%, for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase was driven by an increase of $2.5 million in compensation and employee benefits expenses mainly due to reinstatement of bonuses to employees in fiscal year 2021, which were suspended in fiscal year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase of $2.2 million in outside services offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in travel expenses due to decreased travel as a result of travel restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and a decrease of $0.5 million in facilities expenses.\nSelling and marketing expenses\nSelling and marketing expenses decreased $4.4 million, or 9%, for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease of $3.0 million due to the lower cost of key trade shows that were held virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease of $2.0 million in travel expenses, a decrease of $0.9 million in marketing promotion and materials and $0.2 million lower consulting expense, offset by an increase of $1.7 million in compensation and employee benefits mainly due to the reinstatement of bonuses to employees in fiscal year 2021, which were suspended in fiscal year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $1.6 million, or 4%, for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.6 million in compensation and employee benefits mainly due to the reinstatement of bonuses to employees in fiscal year 2021, which were suspended in fiscal year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increase of $1.7 million this fiscal year compared to prior fiscal year due to the conclusion of a foreign indirect tax audit in fiscal year 2020 offset by a decrease in expense for allowance for credit losses of $1.6 million and a decrease in outside services and consulting of $1.2 million.\nIncome on equity method investment, net\nIncome (loss) on equity method investment was an income of $0.9 million as compared to a loss of $0.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2020.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net increased by $21.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the non-cash gain of $13.0 million related to the value of the Accuray systems contributed to the JV in exchange for 49% equity interest that was recorded in fiscal year 2020, an increase of $5.7 million due to loss on extinguishment of debt and a $4.3 million due to loss on the exchange of our 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2022 that was treated as an extinguishment of old notes. The impact of these items was offset by an increase of $0.4 million in net foreign currency exchange gain, a decrease of $1.2 million in interest expense and a $0.2 million payment received for building improvements to a facility that was vacated in 2020.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was lower in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 due to lower foreign earnings in fiscal 2021. We also released income tax benefits in fiscal 2020 related to final tax assessments from the Swiss tax authorities for the fiscal period 2018 that otherwise would have reflected a much higher income tax expense for us in fiscal 2020.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded share-based compensation expense of $10.6 million, $9.3 million, and $8.2 million, respectively, related to awards under our stock incentive plans. Share-based compensation expense was recorded net of estimated forfeitures. As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately $14.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock options, shares under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period from 0.6 to 2.4 years.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt June 30, 2022, we had $88.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to supply chain disruptions, rising interest rates and inflation, world events, including the Russian-Ukraine war, continuing uncertainty associated with COVID-19 and the risks included in Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors.\u201d Also refer to Note 10, Debt to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the New Credit Facilities and the Notes as of June 30, 2022. Based on our cash and cash equivalents balance, available debt facilities, current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that we will have sufficient cash resources and anticipated cash flows to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, we continue to critically review our liquidity and anticipated capital requirements in light of the significant uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn May 2021, we issued $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 under an indenture between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. $97.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2026 were issued to certain holders of 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2022 in exchange for $82.1 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% Convertible Notes due 2022 outstanding and $2.9 million aggregate principal amount were issued for cash. Concurrently, in May 2021, we entered into a senior secured credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, individually as a lender and agent, and\nthe other lenders (the Credit Agreement\u201d), which provides for a new five-year $80 million term loan facility and a $40 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The initial borrowings under the Credit Agreement, including $25 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, were funded on May 14, 2021, and as of June 30, 2022 we had an outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility of $5.0 million.\nOur liquidity and cash flows has been and could continue to be materially impacted by the diversion of customer resources to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as delays in payments from customers and could be further impacted by additional and prolonged delays in payments from customers, the potential risk mitigation measures, facility closures, or other reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic. There remain uncertainties as to how the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to materially impact our liquidity in the future.\nIn addition, we are unable to predict with certainty the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability to maintain compliance with the debt covenants contained in the credit and security agreements related to our Credit Facilities, including financial covenants regarding the fixed charge coverage ratio and the consolidated senior net leverage ratio. While we were in compliance with such covenants for the year ended June 30, 2022, failure to meet the covenant requirements in the future could cause us to be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately payable. This may require us to obtain waivers or amendments to the credit and security agreement in order to maintain compliance and there can be no certainty that any such waiver or amendment will be available, or what the cost of such waiver or amendment, if obtained, would be. If we are unable to obtain necessary waivers or amendment and the debt under such credit facility is accelerated, we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates, which may not be favorable to us. There is no guarantee that we would be able to satisfy our obligations if any of our indebtedness is accelerated.\nAdditionally, the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries at June 30, 2022 for all countries except Japan, France and Switzerland are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and unavailable for distribution in the form of dividends or otherwise. Repatriation of the Company's foreign earnings from Japan, France and Switzerland are subject to income taxes. As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately $55.1 million of cash and cash equivalents at our foreign subsidiaries. When such funds are repatriated, there will be additional foreign tax withholdings imposed depending on the country from which the funds were repatriated.\nIn addition, the long sales cycle, together with delays in the shipment of CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms or customer cancellations that have increased in light of the COVID-19 pandemic have affected our ability to recognize revenue, which could adversely affect our cash flows.\nCash Flows\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted our global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets all of which could negatively impact our business operations and cash flows for the foreseeable future, including reductions in revenue and delays in payments from customers. The challenges posed by COVID-19 on our business are expected to evolve rapidly. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption and volatility in the financial markets, could materially affect our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $2.4 million in fiscal 2022, resulting primarily from changes in working capital of $22.6 million and a net loss of $5.3 million offset by $25.5 million of non cash items.\n\u2022The net change in working capital was primarily due to increases of $22.9 million in inventories, $12.5 million

million in fiscal 2022, which primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment of $4.7 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $2.4 million in fiscal 2021, which primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment of $2.3 million and an additional investment in the JV of $0.1 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $3.7 million in fiscal 2020, which primarily consisted of purchases of property and equipment.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2022 was $15.4 million, which was primarily due to $15.0 million of repayments under Revolving Credit Facility and $4.0 million paydown in debt offset by $2.3 million in proceeds from employee stock plans and proceeds from options exercises.\nNet cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2021 was $28.8 million, primarily due to the repayment of all outstanding obligations and termination of the Prior Revolving Credit Facility and Prior

stock purchase plan offset by $0.3 million, net repayments under our Prior Revolving Credit Facility and $0.2 million in taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards.\nOperating Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements\nOur future capital requirements depend on numerous factors. These factors include but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022Revenue generated by sales of our products and service plans;\n\u2022Our ability to generate cash flows from operations;\n\u2022Costs associated with our sales and marketing initiatives and manufacturing activities;\n\u2022Facilities, equipment and IT systems required to support current and future operations;\n\u2022Rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities;\n\u2022Costs of obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory clearances of our products;\n\u2022Effects of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022Number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\n\u2022Servicing and maturity of our current future indebtedness;\n\u2022The impact of inflation of our expenses; and\n\u2022The unpredictable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on collections, supply chains and logistics.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents balance will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. If these sources of cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, or we believe market conditions are favorable, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or enter into additional credit facilities. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Additional financing may not be available at all, or in amounts or on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to obtain this additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts.\nOperating and Capital Expenditure Requirements and Contractual Obligations\nOur purchase commitments and obligations include all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services and acquisition and licensing of intellectual property. A majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. Our long-term material cash requirements include lease obligations. See Note 5. Leases.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt June 30, 2022 we had open currency forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies with a stated, or notional, value of approximately $68.3 million. The fair value of the underlying currency based upon the June 30, 2022 exchange rate was approximately $68.3 million. At June 30, 2021 we had open currency forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies with a stated, or notional, value of approximately $54.2 million. The fair value of the underlying currency based upon the June 30, 2022 exchange rate was approximately $54.2 million. We did not have any off balance sheet arrangements for the year ended June 30, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities. However, the economic uncertainty in the current environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could limit our ability to accurately make and evaluate our estimates and judgments. Actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates if actual conditions differ from our assumptions.\nAll of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in Note 1, The Company and its Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Management believes the critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, assessment of recoverability of goodwill, valuation of inventories, convertible notes, impairment of investments and allowance for credit losses.\nConcentration of Credit and Other Risks\nOur cash and cash equivalents are deposited with several major financial institutions. At times, deposits in these institutions exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. We have not experienced any losses in such accounts and do not believe that we are exposed to any significant risk of loss on these balances.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022 there was one customer that represented 10% or more of total net revenue and for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, there were one and no customers, respectively, that represented 10% or more of total net revenue. We had two customers as of June 30, 2022 and two customers as of June 30, 2021, respectively, that each accounted for more than 10% of our total accounts receivable, net.\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain reserves for potential credit losses. Accounts receivable are deemed past due in accordance with the contractual terms of the agreement. Accounts receivable balances are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts once collection efforts are unsuccessful.\nSingle-source suppliers presently provide us with several components. In most cases, if a supplier was unable to deliver these components, we believe that we would be able to find other sources for these components subject to any regulatory qualifications, if required.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is primarily derived from sales of CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms and services, which include PCS contracts (warranty period services and post-warranty services), installation services, training and other professional services. We record our revenue net of any value added or sales tax. We recognize revenue for certain performance obligations at the point in time when control is transferred, such as delivery of products. We recognize revenue for certain other performance obligations over a period of time as control of the goods or services is transferred, such as PCS and construction contracts. Payments received in advance of system shipment are recorded as customer advances and are deferred until product shipment when they are recognized in revenue. We assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and creditworthiness of the customer. We generally do not request collateral from our customers.\nWe frequently enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple performance obligations. For sale arrangements that contain multiple performance obligations, we account for individual products and services separately if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on relative its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The stand-alone selling price ( SSP\u201d). The SSP is determined based on observable prices at which we separately sell the products and services. If a SSP is not directly observable, then we will estimate the SSP considering market conditions, entity-specific factors, and information about the customer or class of customer that is reasonably available.\nProduct Revenue\nThe majority of product revenue is generated from sales of CyberKnife and TomoTherapy platforms, including Radixact Systems. Revenue is recognized once the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product to a customer, which is generally upon delivery.\nWe record revenue from sales of systems, product upgrades and accessories to our customers based on the general terms and conditions of the executed sales and distribution agreements as well as the specific terms and conditions executed for each sale, and once the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product to a customer.\nWe record revenue considering all discounts given to, or expected by, customers. As a result, management may make estimates of potential future product returns or trade ins and other allowances related to product revenue in the current period. In general, we do not allow returns from customers and all discounts and allowances are clearly identified in the terms and conditions of each sale. We derive some product revenue from sales to the JV.\nService Revenue\nService revenue is generated primarily from PCS, installation services, training and professional services. Service revenue is recognized either ratably over the contractual period as control and benefit transfer to the customer or when service is performed, depending on specific terms and conditions in agreements with customers. We derive some service revenue from sales to the JV.\nCosts associated with service revenue are expensed when incurred, except when those costs are related to system upgrades purchased within a service contract. In those cases, the costs of such upgrades are recognized at the time control and benefit of the upgrade transfers to the customer.\nAssessment of Recoverability of Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identified intangible net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis and when impairment indicators are present. We have one operating segment and one reporting unit. Therefore, our consolidated net assets, including existing goodwill are considered to be the carrying value of the reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on the closing price of our common stock on the trading day closest to the annual review date multiplied by the outstanding shares on that date. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is in excess of its fair value, an impairment may exist, and we must perform the second step of the analysis, in which the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to its carrying value to determine the impairment charge, if any. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required.\nValuation of Inventories\nThe valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as damaged inventory. The determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of product demand to support future sales and service. If our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce purchasing and manufacturing output accordingly, we could be required to write off inventory beyond the current reserve, which would negatively impact our gross margin.\nConvertible Notes\nWe account for convertible notes in accordance with applicable guidance which specifies that an issuer of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity component of the conversion option. The amount recorded as debt is based on the fair value of the debt component as a standalone instrument, determined based on an implied credit spread interest rate for nonconvertible debt. This implied credit spread was derived from the trading history of our convertible notes and a range of estimated market volatility. The difference between the debt recorded at inception and its principal amount is accreted to principal during the estimated life of the note. ASC 470-50, provides guidance on modifications to or exchanges of line-of-credit or revolving arrangements which should be evaluated based on borrowing. We adopted ASU 2020-06 in fiscal year 2022, using the modified retrospective method, which no longer accounts for the liability and equity component separately.\nImpairment of Investments\nWe have an equity investment in CNNC Accuray (Tianjin) Medical Technologies Co. Ltd., the Company's joint venture in China. The Company's equity method investment is held at cost and adjusted for impairment when it would be deemed to be impaired. We monitor this investment for events or circumstances indicative of a potential\nimpairment, and we make appropriate reductions in carrying value if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition or near term prospects of the investee.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers prior to authorizing shipment for all major sale transactions. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. If our evaluation of our customers' financial conditions does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions may be needed and our operating results could be negatively affected.", "item_7_tables": "Table 5: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
