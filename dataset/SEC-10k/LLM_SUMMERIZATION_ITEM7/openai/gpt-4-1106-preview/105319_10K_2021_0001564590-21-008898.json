This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, strategies, prospects, objectives, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements discussed in Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read as applying to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, without limitation, those discussed in Risk Factors\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a global wellness company powered by the world's leading commercial weight management program and an award-winning digital subscription platform. We are focused on inspiring people to adopt healthy habits for real life and aim to democratize and deliver wellness for all. With nearly six decades of weight management experience, expertise and know-how, we are one of the most recognized and trusted brand names among weight-conscious consumers. In 2018, we announced new articulations of our brands, including our evolving focus on WW, to further reinforce our mission to focus on overall health and wellness. We educate our members and provide them with guidance and an inspiring community to enable them to develop healthy habits. WW-branded services and products include digital offerings provided through our apps and websites, workshops, consumer products, and various events and experiences. Our business has gone through a significant shift to a digital subscription model over the past several years and our primary sources of revenue are subscriptions for our digital products and for our workshops. Our Digital\u201d business refers to providing subscriptions to our digital product offerings, including Digital 360 and Personal Coaching + Digital. Our Workshops + Digital\u201d (formerly known as Studio + Digital\u201d) business refers to providing unlimited access to our workshops combined with our digital subscription product offerings to commitment plan subscribers. It also includes the provision of access to workshops for members who do not subscribe to commitment plans, including our pay-as-you-go\u201d members.\nWe operate in numerous countries around the world, including through our franchise operations. We have four reportable segments based on an integrated geographical structure as follows: North America, Continental Europe (CE), United Kingdom and Other. See the section entitled Business-Business Organization and Global Operations\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on these reportable segments and the countries in which we operate.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues principally from:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Subscription Revenues.

Additional revenue details are as follows:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Subscription Revenues. Subscription Revenues decreased at a compound annual rate of 3.5% from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020 due to a decrease in Workshops + Digital Fees, partially offset by an increase in Digital Subscription Revenues. Our Workshops + Digital products are priced at a premium compared to our Digital products. Workshops + Digital Fees were negatively impacted by the significant recruitment decline in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 driven by the closure of certain of our studios and the limited reopening of others, as well as the shift in consumer sentiment in the COVID-19 environment. End of Period Subscribers grew in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, in each case on a year-over-year basis. In fiscal 2018, recruitment grew in all of our major markets driven by the successful launch of our program known as WW Freestyle in the majority of our markets. In fiscal 2019, recruitment declined year-over-year due to cycling against the successful launch of the WW Freestyle program and due to the impact of ineffective marketing at the start of fiscal 2019. Despite the negative impact of COVID-19, in fiscal 2020, recruitment grew compared to fiscal 2019 due to the growth in the Digital business, but was lower in total recruitment compared to fiscal 2018 levels. In addition, member retention in the aggregate has improved since fiscal 2018 and was at historic highs in fiscal 2020. Recruitment and retention continue to be a key strategic focus.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> In-studio product sales. In-studio product sales decreased at a compound annual rate of 47.9% from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020.

Operating costs primarily consist of salary expense paid to operations management, commissions and expenses paid to our employees, coaches and guides, studio room rent, customer service costs (both in-house and third-party), program material expenses, depreciation and amortization associated with field automation, credit card and fulfillment fees and training and other expenses. Cost to sell products includes costs of products purchased from our third-party suppliers, inventory reserves, royalties, and inbound and outbound shipping and related costs incurred in making our products available for sale or use. Costs to operate our digital products include salaries and related benefits, depreciation and amortization of website development, credit card processing fees and other costs incurred in developing our digital offerings.\nMarketing Expenses\nMarketing expenses primarily consist of costs to produce advertising and marketing materials as well as media costs to advertise our brand and products across multiple platforms (e.g., broadcast, digital, electronic customer relationship marketing (eCRM), direct mail, social media and public relations), costs paid to third-party agencies who help us develop our marketing campaigns and strategy, expenses in support of market research, as well as costs incurred in connection with local marketing and promotions.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of compensation, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, third-party consulting, temporary help, audit, legal and litigation expenses as well as facility costs and depreciation and amortization of systems in support of the business infrastructure and offices globally. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include amortization expense of certain of our intangible assets and certain one-time transaction expenses.\nGross Margin\nThe following table sets forth our gross profit and gross margin for the past three fiscal years, as adjusted for fiscal 2020 to exclude the impact of the charges associated with our previously disclosed 2020 organizational restructuring plan:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 777.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 786.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 866.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments to Reported Amounts (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2020 restructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Profit, as adjusted (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 801.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 786.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 866.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Margin impact\nfrom above adjustment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Margin, as adjusted (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The As adjusted\u201d measure is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts the consolidated statements of net income for fiscal 2020 to exclude the impact of the $23.3 million ($17.4 million after tax) of 2020 restructuring charges.

While the outbreak of COVID-19 did not have a significant effect on our reported results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, it did have a significant effect on our reported results for the remainder of fiscal 2020. The pandemic initially caused a significant decline in recruitments for both our Digital and our Workshops + Digital businesses, beginning in the middle of March 2020, as compared to the prior year period. Starting in the middle of April 2020, Digital recruitment trends returned to growth and full year fiscal 2020 Digital recruitments were higher as compared to the prior year. Our Workshops + Digital business continued to experience significant declines in recruitments as compared to the prior year through the end of fiscal 2020, a trend that is expected to continue in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and potentially in subsequent periods. With approximately 90% of recruitments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 coming from our Digital business, the recruitment mix shift in the quarter reflected the strength of our Digital business and the closure of certain of our studios as well as the limited re-opening of others. This trend in Workshops + Digital recruitments throughout the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted revenues in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior year. The pandemic did not materially impact our member cancellation rates or overall member retention year-over-year. These trends are reflected in the number of End of Period Subscribers for fiscal 2020, which was up 4% as compared to the prior year, consisting of 3.7 million Digital subscribers and 0.7 million Workshops + Digital subscribers.\nThe extent to which our operations and business trends will continue in future periods to be impacted by, and any unforeseen costs will result from, the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. These developments include, among other things, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak, health implications and vaccine availability, actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, and changes in consumer behavior resulting from the outbreak and such government actions. We continue to actively monitor the ongoing global outbreak of COVID-19 and its impact and related developments and expect, similar to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, that it will significantly impact our reported results for the first half of fiscal 2021 and may potentially do so in subsequent periods.\nIn response to the public health crisis posed by COVID-19, we suspended our in-person workshops and moved quickly to transition these workshops to an entirely virtual experience. In June 2020, we began a phased re-opening with reduced operations of a limited number of our studio locations. We continue to evolve our workshop strategy as we evaluate our cost structure and respond to shifting consumer sentiment. We are selectively resuming in-person workshops where we can in a cost-efficient manner that promotes the health and safety of our employees and members. However, during these uncertain times, we may need to close re-opened studios, may not be able to open studios as planned or may need to further reduce operations. We continue to serve our members virtually, both via our Digital business and through virtual workshops now available to our Workshops + Digital subscribers. Nevertheless, our business operations, recruitment trends with respect to our Workshops + Digital business and in-studio product sales remain substantially affected by our reduced operations. We expect that applicable regulatory restrictions, including continued or reinstated stay-at-home requirements and restrictions on in-person group gatherings, may impact our studio operations, including how we conduct our in-person workshops.\nAs we continue to address the impact of the pandemic, and the related evolving legal and consumer landscape, we are focused on how to best meet our members' and consumers' needs as restrictions are lifted or reinstated. We consolidated certain of our studios into branded studio locations and continue to close certain other branded studio locations. The decision to re-open a studio location, if at all, or further consolidate studio locations, will be influenced by a number of factors, including applicable legal restrictions, consumer confidence and preferences, changes in consumer behavior, and the protection of the health and safety of our employees and members, and will be dependent on cost efficiencies and alignment with our digital and brand strategy. The current number of our studio locations is significantly lower than that prior to the pandemic, and we expect it to remain below pre-COVID-19 levels for the foreseeable future. As a result, we have incurred and will incur significant costs associated with our real estate realignment.\nDue to the negative impact of COVID-19, and the uncertainty of the full extent of the magnitude and duration of such impact on our business and the economies and financial markets in which we operate, in fiscal 2020 we implemented a $100.0 million cost-savings initiative with respect to our cost structure. We undertook this initiative to proactively manage our liquidity so we can maintain flexibility to respond to evolving business and consumer conditions arising from the pandemic, as well as continue to fund investments in innovating our program and long-term debt obligations. Additionally, in June 2020, we amended our Credit Agreement (as defined below) to relax the requirements of the financial maintenance covenant until the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022 so as to provide additional flexibility for accessing liquidity available under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Long-Term Debt-Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d for additional details on this amendment. We expect to continue to assess the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and intend to refine our cost structure and resource allocation accordingly. For additional information on our cash flows and long-term debt, see -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWhile we expect the effects of the pandemic and the related responses to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position, the uncertainty of the full extent of the duration and severity of the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 means we cannot reasonably estimate the related financial impact at this time. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We continue to believe that our powerful communities and our ability to inspire people to adopt healthy habits will be invaluable to people across the globe as they continue to acclimate to new social and economic environments, and that they uniquely position us in the markets in which we operate.\nMarket Trends\nWe believe that our revenues and profitability can be sensitive to major trends in the wellness and weight management industries.

The increase in North America Total Paid Weeks was driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2018 versus the beginning of fiscal 2017, higher Digital recruitments versus the prior year driven by the successful launch of the WW Freestyle program, and improved retention versus the prior year.\nIn fiscal 2019, North America Total Paid Weeks increased 0.3% versus the prior year. The slight increase in North America Total Paid Weeks was driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2019 versus the beginning of fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower recruitments versus the prior year. A weak recruitment start to fiscal 2019 was driven by cycling against the launch of the WW Freestyle program and ineffective marketing in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2019 year-over-year recruitment trends improved through the year and, with the impact of the launch of the myWW program in mid-November 2019, the recruitment trend turned positive in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 versus the prior year period.\nIn fiscal 2020, North America Total Paid Weeks increased 8.1% versus the prior year. The increase in North America Total Paid Weeks was driven primarily by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2020 versus the beginning of fiscal 2019 and higher Digital recruitments in fiscal 2020 versus the prior year. Despite the negative impact of COVID-19, Digital recruitments were higher in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior year, driven by the successful launch of the new myWW program, the appeal of the program and our digital tools, and strong marketing execution versus the prior year. Workshops + Digital recruitments significantly declined in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nContinental Europe Metrics and Business Trends\nIn fiscal 2018, Continental Europe Total Paid Weeks increased 30.6% versus the prior year, driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2018 versus the beginning of fiscal 2017, higher recruitments versus the prior year driven by the successful launch of the WW Freestyle program, and improved retention versus the prior year.\nIn fiscal 2019, Continental Europe Total Paid Weeks increased 11.7% versus the prior year, driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2019 versus the beginning of fiscal 2018. A weak recruitment start to fiscal 2019 was driven by cycling against the launch of the WW Freestyle program in local markets and ineffective marketing in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2019 year-over-year recruitment trends were negative in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 versus the prior year period, and turned positive in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and remained so through the rest of the year.\nIn fiscal 2020, Continental Europe Total Paid Weeks increased 12.5% versus the prior year, driven primarily by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2020 versus the beginning of fiscal 2019 and higher Digital recruitments in fiscal 2020 versus the prior year. Despite the negative impact of COVID-19, Digital recruitments were higher in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior year, driven by the successful launch of the new myWW program, the appeal of the program and our digital tools, and strong marketing execution versus the prior year. Workshops + Digital recruitments significantly declined in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nUnited Kingdom Metrics and Business Trends\nIn fiscal 2018, UK Total Paid Weeks increased 13.2% versus the prior year. The increase in UK Total Paid Weeks was driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2018 versus the beginning of fiscal 2017, recruitment strength in our Digital business versus the prior year driven by the successful launch of the WW Freestyle program, and improved retention versus the prior year.\nIn fiscal 2019, UK Total Paid Weeks increased 3.4% versus the prior year. The increase in UK Total Paid Weeks was driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2019 versus the beginning of fiscal 2018 and improved retention versus the prior year, partially offset by lower recruitments versus the prior year. A weak recruitment start to fiscal 2019 was driven by cycling against the launch of the WW Freestyle program and ineffective marketing in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2019 year-over-year recruitment trends improved through the year and, with the impact of the launch of the myWW program in mid-November 2019, the recruitment trend turned positive in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 versus the prior year period.\nIn fiscal 2020, UK Total Paid Weeks decreased 1.2% versus the prior year. The decrease in UK Total Paid Weeks was driven primarily by lower Workshops + Digital recruitments, partially offset by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2020 versus the beginning of fiscal 2019 and higher Digital recruitments in fiscal 2020 versus the prior year. Despite the negative impact of COVID-19, Digital recruitments were higher in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior year, driven by the successful launch of the new myWW program, the appeal of the program and our digital tools, and strong marketing execution versus the prior year. Workshops + Digital recruitments significantly declined in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, we have disclosed non-GAAP financial measures of operating results that exclude or adjust certain items. Gross profit, gross profit margin, operating income and operating income margin are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both as reported (on a GAAP basis) and as adjusted (on a non-GAAP basis), as applicable, with respect to fiscal 2020 to exclude the impact of the 2020 restructuring charges, the Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the goodwill impairment charge related to our Brazil reporting unit. We generally refer to such non-GAAP measures as excluding or adjusting for the impact of the 2020 restructuring charges, the Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the goodwill impairment charge. We also present within this Annual Report on Form 10-K the non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation ( EBITDAS\u201d); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, 2020 restructuring charges and goodwill impairment ( Adjusted EBITDAS\u201d); total debt less unamortized deferred financing costs, unamortized debt discount and cash on hand (i.e., net debt); and a net debt/Adjusted EBITAS ratio. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-EBITDAS, Adjusted EBITDAS and Net Debt\u201d for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure in each case. Our management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the performance of our business and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of our business. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly entitled measures reported by other companies.\nUse of Constant Currency\nAs exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe in certain cases the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors' ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we calculate constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding or adjusting for the impact of foreign currency or being on a constant currency basis. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP and are not meant to be considered in isolation. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, the impairment analysis for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, share-based compensation, income taxes, tax contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most significant judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised services or goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services or goods.\nWe earn revenue from subscriptions for our digital products and by conducting workshops, for which we charge a fee, predominantly through commitment plans, as well as prepayment plans or the pay-as-you-go\u201d arrangement. We also earn revenue by selling consumer products online through our e-commerce platforms, at our studios and through our trusted partners; collecting royalties from franchisees; collecting royalties related to licensing agreements; and publishing.\nCommitment plan revenues and prepaid workshop fees are recorded to revenue on a straight-line basis as control is transferred since these performance obligations are satisfied over time. Digital Subscription Revenues, consisting of the fees associated with subscriptions for our Digital products, including Digital 360 and Personal Coaching + Digital, are recognized on a straight-line basis as control is transferred since these performance obligations are satisfied over time. One-time Digital sign-up fees are considered immaterial in the context of the contract and the related revenue is amortized into revenue over the commitment period. Workshops + Digital Fees, consisting of the fees associated with subscription plans for combined workshops and digital offerings and other payment arrangements for access to workshops, are recognized on a straight-line basis as control is transferred since these performance obligations are satisfied over time. In the Workshops + Digital business, we generally charge non-refundable registration and starter fees in exchange for access to our digital subscription products, an introductory information session and materials we provide to new members. Revenue from these registration and starter fees is considered immaterial in the context of the contract and is amortized into revenue over the commitment period. Revenue from consumer product sales online through e-commerce platforms and at studios, royalties and commissions, and pay-as-you-go\u201d workshop fees is recognized at the point in time control is transferred, which is when products are shipped to customers and partners and title and risk of loss passes to them, royalties and commissions are earned, and services are rendered, respectively. For revenue transactions that involve multiple performance obligations, the amount of revenue recognized is determined using the relative fair value approach, which is generally based on each performance obligation's stand-alone selling price. Discounts to customers, including free registration offers, are recorded as a deduction from gross revenue in the period such revenue was recognized.\nWe grant refunds in aggregate amounts that historically have not been material. Because the period of payment of the refund generally approximates the period revenue was originally recognized, refunds are recorded as a reduction of revenue over the same period.\nFranchise Rights Acquired\nFinite-lived franchise rights acquired are amortized over the remaining contractual period, which is generally less than one year. Indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired are tested on an annual basis for impairment.\nIn performing the impairment analysis for our indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired, the fair value for our franchise rights acquired is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach referred to as the hypothetical start-up approach for our franchise rights related to our Workshops + Digital business and a relief from royalty methodology for our franchise rights related to our Digital business. The aggregate estimated fair value for these rights is then compared to the carrying value of the unit of account for those franchise rights. We have determined the appropriate unit of account for purposes of assessing impairment to be the combination of the rights in both the Workshops + Digital business and the Digital business in the country in which the applicable acquisition occurred. The net book values of these franchise rights in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date were $681.5 million, $56.7 million, $12.3 million, $6.9 million, and $5.1 million, respectively.\nIn our hypothetical start-up approach analysis for fiscal 2020, we assumed that the year of maturity was reached after 7 years. Subsequent to the year of maturity, we estimated future cash flows for the Workshops + Digital business in each country based on assumptions regarding revenue growth and operating income margins. The cash flows associated with the Digital business in each country were based on the expected Digital revenue for such country and the application of a royalty rate based on current market terms. The cash flows for the Workshops + Digital and Digital businesses were discounted utilizing rates which were calculated using the weighted-average cost of capital, which included the cost of equity and the cost of debt.\nGoodwill\nIn performing the impairment analysis for goodwill, the fair value for our reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. This approach involves projecting future cash flows attributable to the reporting unit and discounting those estimated cash flows using an appropriate discount rate. The estimated fair value is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. We have determined the appropriate reporting unit for purposes of assessing annual impairment to be the country for all reporting units. The net book values of goodwill in the United States, Canada and other countries as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date were $103.0 million, $42.1 million and $10.5 million, respectively.\nFor all of our reporting units tested as of May 3, 2020, we estimated future cash flows by utilizing the historical debt-free cash flows (cash flows provided by operations less capital expenditures) attributable to that country and then applied expected future operating income growth rates for such country. We utilized operating income as the basis for measuring our potential growth because we believe it is the best indicator of the performance of our business. We then discounted the estimated future cash flows utilizing a discount rate which was calculated using the weighted-average cost of capital, which included the cost of equity and the cost of debt.\nIndefinite-Lived Franchise Rights Acquired and Goodwill Annual Impairment Test\nWe review indefinite-lived intangible assets, including franchise rights acquired with indefinite lives, and goodwill for potential impairment on at least an annual basis or more often if events so require. We performed fair value impairment testing as of May 3, 2020 and May 5, 2019, each the first day of fiscal May, on our indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill.\nIn performing our annual impairment analysis as of May 3, 2020 and May 5, 2019, we determined that the carrying amounts of our franchise rights acquired with indefinite lives units of account and goodwill reporting units did not exceed their respective fair values and, therefore, no impairment existed.\nWhen determining fair value, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. A change in these underlying assumptions could cause a change in the results of the impairment assessments and, as such, could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts and result in an impairment of those assets. In the event such a result occurred, we would be required to record a corresponding charge, which would impact earnings. We would also be required to reduce the carrying amounts of the related assets on our balance sheet. We continue to evaluate these assumptions and believe that these assumptions are appropriate.\nIn performing our annual impairment analysis, we also considered the trading value of both our equity and debt. If the trading values of both our equity and debt were to significantly decline from their current levels, we may have to take an impairment charge at the appropriate time, which could be material. For additional information on risks associated with our recognizing asset impairment charges, see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBased on the results of our May 3, 2020 annual franchise rights acquired impairment analysis performed for all of our units of account, except for Canada and New Zealand, as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date, those units had an estimated fair value at least 35% higher than the respective unit's carrying amount. Collectively, these units of account represent 91.9% of our total franchise rights acquired. Based on the results of our annual franchise rights acquired impairment test performed for our Canada unit of account, which holds 7.4% of our franchise rights acquired as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date, the estimated fair value of this unit of account exceeded its carrying value by approximately 16.5%. Based on the results of our annual franchise rights acquired impairment test performed for our New Zealand unit of account, which holds 0.7% of our franchise rights acquired as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date, the estimated fair value of this unit of account exceeded its carrying value by approximately 9.8%. Accordingly, a change in the underlying assumptions for New Zealand may change the results of the impairment assessment and, as such, could result in an impairment of the franchise rights acquired related to New Zealand, for which the net book value was $5.1 million as of January 2, 2021.\nIn performing this impairment analysis for fiscal 2020, for the year of maturity, we assumed Workshops + Digital revenue (comprised of Workshops + Digital Fees and revenues from products sold to members in studios) growth of (30.6%) to (39.3%) in the year of maturity from fiscal 2019, in each case, earned in the applicable country and assumed cumulative annual revenue growth rates for the years beyond the year of maturity of 1.7%. For the year of maturity and beyond, we assumed operating income margin rates of 0.2% to 12.4%.\nBased on the results of our May 3, 2020 annual goodwill impairment test performed for all of our reporting units as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date, there was significant headroom in the goodwill impairment analysis for those units, with the difference between the carrying value and the fair value exceeding 100%.\nThe following are the more significant assumptions utilized in our annual impairment analyses for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt-Free Cumulative Annual Cash Flow Growth Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0% to 13.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBrazil Goodwill Impairment\nWith respect to our Brazil reporting unit, during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we made a strategic decision to shift to an exclusively Digital business in that country. We determined that this decision, together with the negative impact of COVID-19, the ongoing challenging economic environment in Brazil and our reduced expectations regarding the reporting unit's future operating cash flows, required us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis. In performing this discounted cash flow analysis, we determined that the carrying amount of this reporting unit exceeded its fair value and as a result recorded an impairment charge of $3.7 million, which comprises the remaining balance of goodwill for this reporting unit.\nAs it relates to our goodwill impairment analysis for Brazil, we estimated future debt-free cash flows in contemplation of our growth strategies for that market. In developing these projections, we considered the growth strategies under the current market conditions in Brazil. We then discounted the estimated future cash flows utilizing a discount rate which was calculated using the weighted-average cost of capital, which included the cost of equity and the cost of debt.\nOther Critical Accounting Policies\nInformation concerning other critical accounting policies affecting us is set forth in Note 2 of our audited consolidated financial statements, contained in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2020 (53 weeks) COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 (52 weeks)\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31st and consists of either 52- or 53-week periods. Fiscal 2020 contained 53 weeks, while fiscal 2019 contained 52 weeks. The 2020 53rd week, which began on December 27, 2020 and ended on January 2, 2021, contributed 4.3 million, or 1.7%, to Total Paid Weeks for fiscal 2020. It drove additional revenues of $20.9 million, or 1.5%, for fiscal 2020. Due to the timing of the 53rd week, additional marketing expense drove a decline in fiscal 2020 operating income. The 53rd week also resulted in an additional week of interest expense. As a result, in the aggregate the 53rd week had a negative $0.03 per share impact on fiscal 2020 EPS.\nThe table below sets forth selected financial information for fiscal 2020 from our consolidated statements of net income for fiscal 2020 versus selected financial information for fiscal 2019 from our consolidated statements of net income for fiscal 2019.\nSummary of Selected Financial

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d above for an explanation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Results\nRevenues\nRevenues in fiscal 2020 were $1,378.1 million, a decrease of $35.2 million, or 2.5%, versus fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which positively impacted our revenues for fiscal 2020 by $4.7 million, revenues in fiscal 2020 would have decreased 2.8% versus the prior year. This decrease was driven primarily by lower revenues related to Workshops + Digital Fees and in-studio product sales as a result of the closure of our studios and reduced operations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. See -Segment Results\u201d for additional details on revenues.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\nTotal cost of revenues in fiscal 2020 decreased $26.4 million, or 4.2%, versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of $23.3 million of 2020 restructuring charges, total cost of revenues in fiscal 2020 would have decreased by 7.9%, or 8.1% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year. Gross profit decreased $8.8 million, or 1.1%, in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which positively impacted gross profit for fiscal 2020 by $3.6 million, gross profit in fiscal 2020 would have decreased 1.6% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of $23.3 million of 2020 restructuring charges, gross profit in fiscal 2020 would have increased by 1.8%, or 1.4% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year. Gross margin in fiscal 2020 increased 0.8% to 56.4% versus 55.7% in fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of $23.3 million of 2020 restructuring charges, gross margin in fiscal 2020 would have increased 2.5% to 58.1% versus the prior year. Gross margin increase was driven primarily by a mix shift to our higher margin Digital business, offset in part by a contraction of margins in the Workshops + Digital business and lower margins related to consumer product sales.\nMarketing\nMarketing expenses for fiscal 2020 increased $16.7 million, or 6.9%, versus fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which increased marketing expenses for fiscal 2020 by $1.0 million, marketing expenses in fiscal 2020 would have increased 6.4% versus fiscal 2019. This increase in marketing expense was primarily due to fiscal 2020 including a 53rd week, which bridged the last week of December 2020 and ended on January 2, 2021, and had a high concentration of advertising spending. Marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 18.9% in fiscal 2020 as compared to 17.3% in fiscal 2019.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 increased $42.6 million, or 16.7%, versus fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which increased selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 by $0.3 million, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 would have increased 16.6% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of the $32.7 million Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and $9.8 million of 2020 restructuring charges, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 would have been flat, or decreased by 0.1% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2020 increased to 21.6% from 18.0% for fiscal 2019.\nImpairment\nIn performing our interim impairment analysis for our Brazil reporting unit, we determined that, based on the fair values calculated, the carrying amount of goodwill related to our Brazil reporting unit exceeded our fair value and recorded an impairment charge of $3.7 million for fiscal 2020.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for fiscal 2020 decreased $71.8 million, or 24.9%, versus fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which positively impacted operating income for fiscal 2020 by $3.3 million, operating income in fiscal 2020 would have decreased 26.1% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of the $33.1 million of 2020 restructuring charges, the $32.7 million Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the $3.7 million goodwill impairment charge related to our Brazil reporting unit, operating income in fiscal 2020 would have decreased by 0.8%, or 1.6% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year. This decrease in operating income was driven primarily by an increase in marketing expenses, partially offset by an increase in gross profit as compared to the prior year. Operating income margin for fiscal 2020 decreased 4.7% to 15.7% from 20.4% for fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of the 2020 restructuring charges, the Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the goodwill impairment charge, operating income margin in fiscal 2020 would have increased by 0.3%, both as reported and on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year. This slight increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by an increase in gross margin, almost fully offset by an increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, versus the prior year.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in fiscal 2020 decreased $12.0 million, or 8.8%, versus fiscal 2019. The decrease in interest expense was driven primarily by a decrease in our outstanding indebtedness resulting from principal repayments. The effective interest rate on our debt, based on interest incurred (which includes amortization of our deferred financing costs and debt discount) and our average borrowings during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 and excluding the impact of our interest rate swaps then in effect, decreased to 6.94% per annum at fiscal 2020 year end from 8.07% per annum at fiscal 2019 year end. Including the impact of our interest rate swaps then in effect, the effective interest rate on our debt, based on interest incurred (which includes amortization of our deferred financing costs and debt discount) and our average borrowings during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, decreased to 7.72% per annum at fiscal 2020 year end from 8.02% per annum at fiscal 2019 year end. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Long-Term Debt\u201d for additional details regarding our debt, including interest rates and payments thereon. For additional details on our interest rate swaps, see", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d included in Item 6 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We are focused on inspiring people to adopt healthy habits for real life and aim to democratize and deliver wellness for all. With nearly six decades of weight management experience, expertise and know-how, we are one of the most recognized and trusted brand names among weight-conscious consumers. In 2018, we announced new articulations of our brands, including our evolving focus on WW, to further reinforce our mission to focus on overall health and wellness. We educate our members and provide them with guidance and an inspiring community to enable them to develop healthy habits. WW-branded services and products include digital offerings provided through our apps and websites, workshops, consumer products, and various events and experiences. Our business has gone through a significant shift to a digital subscription model over the past several years and our primary sources of revenue are subscriptions for our digital products and for our workshops. Our Digital\u201d business refers to providing subscriptions to our digital product offerings, including Digital 360 and Personal Coaching + Digital. Our Workshops + Digital\u201d (formerly known as Studio + Digital\u201d) business refers to providing unlimited access to our workshops combined with our digital subscription product offerings to commitment plan subscribers. It also includes the provision of access to workshops for members who do not subscribe to commitment plans, including our pay-as-you-go\u201d members.\nWe operate in numerous countries around the world, including through our franchise operations. We have four reportable segments based on an integrated geographical structure as follows: North America, Continental Europe (CE), United Kingdom and Other. See the section entitled Business-Business Organization and Global Operations\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on these reportable segments and the countries in which we operate.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues principally from:\n \u2022 Subscription Revenues. Our Subscription Revenues\u201d consist of Digital Subscription Revenues\u201d and Workshops + Digital Fees\u201d (formerly known as Studio + Digital Fees\u201d). Digital Subscription Revenues\u201d consist of the fees associated with subscriptions for our Digital offerings, including Digital 360 and Personal Coaching + Digital. Workshops + Digital Fees\u201d consist of the fees associated with our subscription plans for combined workshops and digital offerings and other payment arrangements for access to workshops. \n \u2022 In-studio product sales. We sell a range of consumer products, including bars, snacks, cookbooks and kitchen tools, in our studios. \n \u2022 E-commerce, licensing, franchise royalties and other. We license our trademarks and other intellectual property in certain categories of food, beverages and other relevant consumer products and services. We also co-brand or endorse with carefully selected branded consumer products and services. In addition, our franchisees typically pay us a royalty fee of 10% of their Workshops + Digital fee revenues as well as purchase products for sale in their workshops. \nWe also generate other revenues including revenues from sales of products online through our e-commerce platforms and through our trusted partners and publishing.\nThe following table sets forth our revenues by category for the past three fiscal years.\nRevenue Sources\n(in millions)\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (53 weeks)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (52 weeks)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (52 weeks)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,186.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,207.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,273.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In-studio product sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 148.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> E-commerce, licensing, franchise royalties and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 151.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,378.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,413.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,514.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\nFrom fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020, our revenues decreased at a compound annual rate of 4.6% driven primarily by a decrease in in-studio product sales. Additional revenue details are as follows:\n \u2022 Subscription Revenues. Subscription Revenues decreased at a compound annual rate of 3.5% from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020 due to a decrease in Workshops + Digital Fees, partially offset by an increase in Digital Subscription Revenues. Our Workshops + Digital products are priced at a premium compared to our Digital products. Workshops + Digital Fees were negatively impacted by the significant recruitment decline in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 driven by the closure of certain of our studios and the limited reopening of others, as well as the shift in consumer sentiment in the COVID-19 environment. End of Period Subscribers grew in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, in each case on a year-over-year basis. In fiscal 2018, recruitment grew in all of our major markets driven by the successful launch of our program known as WW Freestyle in the majority of our markets. In fiscal 2019, recruitment declined year-over-year due to cycling against the successful launch of the WW Freestyle program and due to the impact of ineffective marketing at the start of fiscal 2019. Despite the negative impact of COVID-19, in fiscal 2020, recruitment grew compared to fiscal 2019 due to the growth in the Digital business, but was lower in total recruitment compared to fiscal 2018 levels. In addition, member retention in the aggregate has improved since fiscal 2018 and was at historic highs in fiscal 2020. Recruitment and retention continue to be a key strategic focus. \n \u2022 In-studio product sales. In-studio product sales decreased at a compound annual rate of 47.9% from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020. From fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019, the decrease in in-studio product sales was driven primarily by a decrease in the number of our Workshops + Digital subscribers. From fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020, the decrease in in-studio product sales was driven primarily by the closure of certain of our studios and the limited reopening of others, as well as the shift in consumer sentiment in the COVID-19 environment. \n \u2022 E-commerce, licensing, franchise royalties and other. All other revenues increased 28.2% on a compound annual rate from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in e-commerce product sales. \nCost of Revenues\nTotal cost of revenues primarily consists of expenses to operate our studios and workshops, costs to sell consumer products and costs to develop and operate our digital products. Operating costs primarily consist of salary expense paid to operations management, commissions and expenses paid to our employees, coaches and guides, studio room rent, customer service costs (both in-house and third-party), program material expenses, depreciation and amortization associated with field automation, credit card and fulfillment fees and training and other expenses. Cost to sell products includes costs of products purchased from our third-party suppliers, inventory reserves, royalties, and inbound and outbound shipping and related costs incurred in making our products available for sale or use. Costs to operate our digital products include salaries and related benefits, depreciation and amortization of website development, credit card processing fees and other costs incurred in developing our digital offerings.\nMarketing Expenses\nMarketing expenses primarily consist of costs to produce advertising and marketing materials as well as media costs to advertise our brand and products across multiple platforms (e.g., broadcast, digital, electronic customer relationship marketing (eCRM), direct mail, social media and public relations), costs paid to third-party agencies who help us develop our marketing campaigns and strategy, expenses in support of market research, as well as costs incurred in connection with local marketing and promotions.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of compensation, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, third-party consulting, temporary help, audit, legal and litigation expenses as well as facility costs and depreciation and amortization of systems in support of the business infrastructure and offices globally. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include amortization expense of certain of our intangible assets and certain one-time transaction expenses.\nGross Margin\nThe following table sets forth our gross profit and gross margin for the past three fiscal years, as adjusted for fiscal 2020 to exclude the impact of the charges associated with our previously disclosed 2020 organizational restructuring plan:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 777.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 786.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 866.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments to Reported Amounts (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2020 restructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Profit, as adjusted (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 801.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 786.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 866.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Margin impact\nfrom above adjustment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross Margin, as adjusted (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n (1) The As adjusted\u201d measure is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts the consolidated statements of net income for fiscal 2020 to exclude the impact of the $23.3 million ($17.4 million after tax) of 2020 restructuring charges. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for an explanation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures. \nIn fiscal 2020, excluding the impact of the 2020 restructuring charges, the gross margin increase from fiscal 2019 was driven primarily by a mix shift to our higher margin Digital business, offset in part by a contraction of margins in the Workshops + Digital business and lower margins related to consumer product sales.\nIn fiscal 2019, the gross margin decrease from fiscal 2018 was driven primarily by decreased operating leverage across our businesses, partially offset by a mix shift to the higher margin Digital business.\nOperating Income Margin\nThe following table sets forth our operating income for the past three fiscal years, as adjusted for fiscal 2020 to exclude the impact of the 2020 restructuring charges, the Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the impairment charge for our goodwill related to our Brazil reporting unit, as applicable:\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 216.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 288.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 389.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments to Reported Amounts (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2020 restructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Winfrey Stock Compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income, as adjusted (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 285.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 288.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 389.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income Margin impact\nfrom above adjustment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Income Margin, as\nadjusted (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n (1) The As adjusted\u201d measure is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts the consolidated statements of net income for fiscal 2020 to exclude the impact of the $33.1 million ($24.8 million after tax) of 2020 restructuring charges, the $32.7 million ($24.5 million after tax) Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the $3.7 million ($2.7 million after tax) goodwill impairment charge related to our Brazil reporting unit. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for an explanation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures. \nIn fiscal 2020, excluding the impact of the 2020 restructuring charges, the Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the goodwill impairment charge, the slight increase in operating income margin from fiscal 2019 was driven primarily by an increase in gross margin, almost fully offset by an increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nIn fiscal 2019, the decrease in operating income margin from fiscal 2018 was driven primarily by an increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue, by a decrease in gross margin and by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nMaterial Trends\nPerformance Indicators\nOur management team regularly reviews and analyzes a number of financial and operating metrics, including the key performance indicators listed below, in order to manage our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, determine the allocation of resources, make decisions regarding corporate strategies and assess the quality and potential variability of our cash flows and earnings. We also believe that these key performance indicators are useful to both management and investors for forecasting purposes and to facilitate comparisons to our historical operating results. These metrics are supplemental to our GAAP results and include operational measures.\n \u2022 Revenues-Our Subscription Revenues\u201d consist of Digital Subscription Revenues\u201d and Workshops + Digital Fees\u201d. Digital Subscription Revenues\u201d consist of the fees associated with subscriptions for our Digital offerings, including Digital 360 and Personal Coaching + Digital. Workshops + Digital Fees\u201d consist of the fees associated with our subscription plans for combined workshops and digital offerings and other payment arrangements for access to workshops. In addition, product sales and other\u201d consists of sales of consumer products via e-commerce, in studios and through our trusted partners, revenues from licensing and publishing, other revenues (including revenues from the WW Presents: Oprah's 2020 Vision tour), and, in the case of the consolidated financial results and Other reportable segment, franchise fees with respect to commitment plans and royalties. \n \u2022 Paid Weeks-The Paid Weeks\u201d metric reports paid weeks by WW customers in Company-owned operations for a given period as follows: (i) Digital Paid Weeks\u201d is the total paid subscription weeks for our digital subscription products (including Digital 360 and Personal Coaching + Digital); (ii) Workshops + Digital Paid Weeks\u201d (formerly known as Studio + Digital Paid Weeks\u201d) is the sum of total paid commitment plan weeks which include workshops and digital offerings and total pay-as-you-go\u201d weeks; and (iii) Total Paid Weeks\u201d is the sum of Digital Paid Weeks and Workshops + Digital Paid Weeks. \n \u2022 Incoming Subscribers- Subscribers\u201d refer to Digital subscribers and Workshops + Digital subscribers who participate in recur bill programs in Company-owned operations. The Incoming Subscribers\u201d metric reports WW subscribers in Company-owned operations at a given period start as follows: (i) Incoming Digital Subscribers\u201d is the total number of Digital, including Digital 360 and Personal Coaching + Digital, subscribers; (ii) Incoming Workshops + Digital Subscribers\u201d (formerly known as Incoming Studio + Digital Subscribers\u201d) is the total number of commitment plan subscribers that have access to combined workshops and digital offerings; and (iii) Incoming Subscribers\u201d is the sum of Incoming Digital Subscribers and Incoming Workshops + Digital Subscribers. Recruitment and retention are key drivers for this metric. \n \u2022 End of Period Subscribers-The End of Period Subscribers\u201d metric reports WW subscribers in Company-owned operations at a given period end as follows: (i) End of Period Digital Subscribers\u201d is the total number of Digital, including Digital 360 and Personal Coaching + Digital, subscribers; (ii) End of Period Workshops + Digital Subscribers\u201d (formerly known as End of Period Studio + Digital Subscribers\u201d) is the total number of commitment plan subscribers that have access to combined workshops and digital offerings; and (iii) End of Period Subscribers\u201d is the sum of End of Period Digital Subscribers and End of Period Workshops + Digital Subscribers. Recruitment and retention are key drivers for this metric. \n \u2022 Gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. \nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread globally and to impact our business operations and the markets in which we operate. While the outbreak of COVID-19 did not have a significant effect on our reported results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, it did have a significant effect on our reported results for the remainder of fiscal 2020. The pandemic initially caused a significant decline in recruitments for both our Digital and our Workshops + Digital businesses, beginning in the middle of March 2020, as compared to the prior year period. Starting in the middle of April 2020, Digital recruitment trends returned to growth and full year fiscal 2020 Digital recruitments were higher as compared to the prior year. Our Workshops + Digital business continued to experience significant declines in recruitments as compared to the prior year through the end of fiscal 2020, a trend that is expected to continue in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and potentially in subsequent periods. With approximately 90% of recruitments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 coming from our Digital business, the recruitment mix shift in the quarter reflected the strength of our Digital business and the closure of certain of our studios as well as the limited re-opening of others. This trend in Workshops + Digital recruitments throughout the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted revenues in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior year. The pandemic did not materially impact our member cancellation rates or overall member retention year-over-year. These trends are reflected in the number of End of Period Subscribers for fiscal 2020, which was up 4% as compared to the prior year, consisting of 3.7 million Digital subscribers and 0.7 million Workshops + Digital subscribers.\nThe extent to which our operations and business trends will continue in future periods to be impacted by, and any unforeseen costs will result from, the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. These developments include, among other things, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak, health implications and vaccine availability, actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, and changes in consumer behavior resulting from the outbreak and such government actions. We continue to actively monitor the ongoing global outbreak of COVID-19 and its impact and related developments and expect, similar to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, that it will significantly impact our reported results for the first half of fiscal 2021 and may potentially do so in subsequent periods.\nIn response to the public health crisis posed by COVID-19, we suspended our in-person workshops and moved quickly to transition these workshops to an entirely virtual experience. In June 2020, we began a phased re-opening with reduced operations of a limited number of our studio locations. We continue to evolve our workshop strategy as we evaluate our cost structure and respond to shifting consumer sentiment. We are selectively resuming in-person workshops where we can in a cost-efficient manner that promotes the health and safety of our employees and members. However, during these uncertain times, we may need to close re-opened studios, may not be able to open studios as planned or may need to further reduce operations. We continue to serve our members virtually, both via our Digital business and through virtual workshops now available to our Workshops + Digital subscribers. Nevertheless, our business operations, recruitment trends with respect to our Workshops + Digital business and in-studio product sales remain substantially affected by our reduced operations. We expect that applicable regulatory restrictions, including continued or reinstated stay-at-home requirements and restrictions on in-person group gatherings, may impact our studio operations, including how we conduct our in-person workshops.\nAs we continue to address the impact of the pandemic, and the related evolving legal and consumer landscape, we are focused on how to best meet our members' and consumers' needs as restrictions are lifted or reinstated. We consolidated certain of our studios into branded studio locations and continue to close certain other branded studio locations. The decision to re-open a studio location, if at all, or further consolidate studio locations, will be influenced by a number of factors, including applicable legal restrictions, consumer confidence and preferences, changes in consumer behavior, and the protection of the health and safety of our employees and members, and will be dependent on cost efficiencies and alignment with our digital and brand strategy. The current number of our studio locations is significantly lower than that prior to the pandemic, and we expect it to remain below pre-COVID-19 levels for the foreseeable future. As a result, we have incurred and will incur significant costs associated with our real estate realignment.\nDue to the negative impact of COVID-19, and the uncertainty of the full extent of the magnitude and duration of such impact on our business and the economies and financial markets in which we operate, in fiscal 2020 we implemented a $100.0 million cost-savings initiative with respect to our cost structure. We undertook this initiative to proactively manage our liquidity so we can maintain flexibility to respond to evolving business and consumer conditions arising from the pandemic, as well as continue to fund investments in innovating our program and long-term debt obligations. Additionally, in June 2020, we amended our Credit Agreement (as defined below) to relax the requirements of the financial maintenance covenant until the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022 so as to provide additional flexibility for accessing liquidity available under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Long-Term Debt-Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d for additional details on this amendment. We expect to continue to assess the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and intend to refine our cost structure and resource allocation accordingly. For additional information on our cash flows and long-term debt, see -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWhile we expect the effects of the pandemic and the related responses to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position, the uncertainty of the full extent of the duration and severity of the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 means we cannot reasonably estimate the related financial impact at this time. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We continue to believe that our powerful communities and our ability to inspire people to adopt healthy habits will be invaluable to people across the globe as they continue to acclimate to new social and economic environments, and that they uniquely position us in the markets in which we operate.\nMarket Trends\nWe believe that our revenues and profitability can be sensitive to major trends in the wellness and weight management industries. In particular, we believe that our business could be adversely impacted by:\n \u2022 increased competition from weight loss and wellness apps; \n \u2022 increased consumer interest in fad diets and weight loss trends; \n \u2022 the development of more effective or more favorably perceived weight management methods or technologies, including by the pharmaceutical, genetics and biotechnology industries; \n \u2022 a failure to develop and market new, innovative services and products, to enhance our existing services and products, or to successfully expand into new channels of distribution or respond to consumer trends, including consumer focus on integrated lifestyle and fitness approaches; \n \u2022 a failure to successfully implement new strategic initiatives; \n \u2022 a decrease in the effectiveness of our marketing, advertising, and social media programs or an increase in the effectiveness of our competitors' similar programs; \n \u2022 an impairment of our brands and other intellectual property; \n \u2022 a failure of our technology or systems to perform as designed; \n \u2022 any event or condition, including health epidemics and natural disasters, that may discourage or impede people from gathering with others or accessing resources; and \n \u2022 a downturn in general economic conditions or consumer confidence. \nNorth America Metrics and Business Trends\nIn fiscal 2018, North America Total Paid Weeks increased 26.3% versus the prior year. The increase in North America Total Paid Weeks was driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2018 versus the beginning of fiscal 2017, higher Digital recruitments versus the prior year driven by the successful launch of the WW Freestyle program, and improved retention versus the prior year.\nIn fiscal 2019, North America Total Paid Weeks increased 0.3% versus the prior year. The slight increase in North America Total Paid Weeks was driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2019 versus the beginning of fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower recruitments versus the prior year. A weak recruitment start to fiscal 2019 was driven by cycling against the launch of the WW Freestyle program and ineffective marketing in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2019 year-over-year recruitment trends improved through the year and, with the impact of the launch of the myWW program in mid-November 2019, the recruitment trend turned positive in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 versus the prior year period.\nIn fiscal 2020, North America Total Paid Weeks increased 8.1% versus the prior year. The increase in North America Total Paid Weeks was driven primarily by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2020 versus the beginning of fiscal 2019 and higher Digital recruitments in fiscal 2020 versus the prior year. Despite the negative impact of COVID-19, Digital recruitments were higher in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior year, driven by the successful launch of the new myWW program, the appeal of the program and our digital tools, and strong marketing execution versus the prior year. Workshops + Digital recruitments significantly declined in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nContinental Europe Metrics and Business Trends\nIn fiscal 2018, Continental Europe Total Paid Weeks increased 30.6% versus the prior year, driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2018 versus the beginning of fiscal 2017, higher recruitments versus the prior year driven by the successful launch of the WW Freestyle program, and improved retention versus the prior year.\nIn fiscal 2019, Continental Europe Total Paid Weeks increased 11.7% versus the prior year, driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2019 versus the beginning of fiscal 2018. A weak recruitment start to fiscal 2019 was driven by cycling against the launch of the WW Freestyle program in local markets and ineffective marketing in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2019 year-over-year recruitment trends were negative in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 versus the prior year period, and turned positive in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and remained so through the rest of the year.\nIn fiscal 2020, Continental Europe Total Paid Weeks increased 12.5% versus the prior year, driven primarily by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2020 versus the beginning of fiscal 2019 and higher Digital recruitments in fiscal 2020 versus the prior year. Despite the negative impact of COVID-19, Digital recruitments were higher in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior year, driven by the successful launch of the new myWW program, the appeal of the program and our digital tools, and strong marketing execution versus the prior year. Workshops + Digital recruitments significantly declined in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nUnited Kingdom Metrics and Business Trends\nIn fiscal 2018, UK Total Paid Weeks increased 13.2% versus the prior year. The increase in UK Total Paid Weeks was driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2018 versus the beginning of fiscal 2017, recruitment strength in our Digital business versus the prior year driven by the successful launch of the WW Freestyle program, and improved retention versus the prior year.\nIn fiscal 2019, UK Total Paid Weeks increased 3.4% versus the prior year. The increase in UK Total Paid Weeks was driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2019 versus the beginning of fiscal 2018 and improved retention versus the prior year, partially offset by lower recruitments versus the prior year. A weak recruitment start to fiscal 2019 was driven by cycling against the launch of the WW Freestyle program and ineffective marketing in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2019 year-over-year recruitment trends improved through the year and, with the impact of the launch of the myWW program in mid-November 2019, the recruitment trend turned positive in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 versus the prior year period.\nIn fiscal 2020, UK Total Paid Weeks decreased 1.2% versus the prior year. The decrease in UK Total Paid Weeks was driven primarily by lower Workshops + Digital recruitments, partially offset by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2020 versus the beginning of fiscal 2019 and higher Digital recruitments in fiscal 2020 versus the prior year. Despite the negative impact of COVID-19, Digital recruitments were higher in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior year, driven by the successful launch of the new myWW program, the appeal of the program and our digital tools, and strong marketing execution versus the prior year. Workshops + Digital recruitments significantly declined in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, we have disclosed non-GAAP financial measures of operating results that exclude or adjust certain items. Gross profit, gross profit margin, operating income and operating income margin are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both as reported (on a GAAP basis) and as adjusted (on a non-GAAP basis), as applicable, with respect to fiscal 2020 to exclude the impact of the 2020 restructuring charges, the Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the goodwill impairment charge related to our Brazil reporting unit. We generally refer to such non-GAAP measures as excluding or adjusting for the impact of the 2020 restructuring charges, the Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the goodwill impairment charge. We also present within this Annual Report on Form 10-K the non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation ( EBITDAS\u201d); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, 2020 restructuring charges and goodwill impairment ( Adjusted EBITDAS\u201d); total debt less unamortized deferred financing costs, unamortized debt discount and cash on hand (i.e., net debt); and a net debt/Adjusted EBITAS ratio. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-EBITDAS, Adjusted EBITDAS and Net Debt\u201d for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure in each case. Our management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the performance of our business and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of our business. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly entitled measures reported by other companies.\nUse of Constant Currency\nAs exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe in certain cases the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors' ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we calculate constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding or adjusting for the impact of foreign currency or being on a constant currency basis. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP and are not meant to be considered in isolation. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, the impairment analysis for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, share-based compensation, income taxes, tax contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most significant judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised services or goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services or goods.\nWe earn revenue from subscriptions for our digital products and by conducting workshops, for which we charge a fee, predominantly through commitment plans, as well as prepayment plans or the pay-as-you-go\u201d arrangement. We also earn revenue by selling consumer products online through our e-commerce platforms, at our studios and through our trusted partners; collecting royalties from franchisees; collecting royalties related to licensing agreements; and publishing.\nCommitment plan revenues and prepaid workshop fees are recorded to revenue on a straight-line basis as control is transferred since these performance obligations are satisfied over time. Digital Subscription Revenues, consisting of the fees associated with subscriptions for our Digital products, including Digital 360 and Personal Coaching + Digital, are recognized on a straight-line basis as control is transferred since these performance obligations are satisfied over time. One-time Digital sign-up fees are considered immaterial in the context of the contract and the related revenue is amortized into revenue over the commitment period. Workshops + Digital Fees, consisting of the fees associated with subscription plans for combined workshops and digital offerings and other payment arrangements for access to workshops, are recognized on a straight-line basis as control is transferred since these performance obligations are satisfied over time. In the Workshops + Digital business, we generally charge non-refundable registration and starter fees in exchange for access to our digital subscription products, an introductory information session and materials we provide to new members. Revenue from these registration and starter fees is considered immaterial in the context of the contract and is amortized into revenue over the commitment period. Revenue from consumer product sales online through e-commerce platforms and at studios, royalties and commissions, and pay-as-you-go\u201d workshop fees is recognized at the point in time control is transferred, which is when products are shipped to customers and partners and title and risk of loss passes to them, royalties and commissions are earned, and services are rendered, respectively. For revenue transactions that involve multiple performance obligations, the amount of revenue recognized is determined using the relative fair value approach, which is generally based on each performance obligation's stand-alone selling price. Discounts to customers, including free registration offers, are recorded as a deduction from gross revenue in the period such revenue was recognized.\nWe grant refunds in aggregate amounts that historically have not been material. Because the period of payment of the refund generally approximates the period revenue was originally recognized, refunds are recorded as a reduction of revenue over the same period.\nFranchise Rights Acquired\nFinite-lived franchise rights acquired are amortized over the remaining contractual period, which is generally less than one year. Indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired are tested on an annual basis for impairment.\nIn performing the impairment analysis for our indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired, the fair value for our franchise rights acquired is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach referred to as the hypothetical start-up approach for our franchise rights related to our Workshops + Digital business and a relief from royalty methodology for our franchise rights related to our Digital business. The aggregate estimated fair value for these rights is then compared to the carrying value of the unit of account for those franchise rights. We have determined the appropriate unit of account for purposes of assessing impairment to be the combination of the rights in both the Workshops + Digital business and the Digital business in the country in which the applicable acquisition occurred. The net book values of these franchise rights in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date were $681.5 million, $56.7 million, $12.3 million, $6.9 million, and $5.1 million, respectively.\nIn our hypothetical start-up approach analysis for fiscal 2020, we assumed that the year of maturity was reached after 7 years. Subsequent to the year of maturity, we estimated future cash flows for the Workshops + Digital business in each country based on assumptions regarding revenue growth and operating income margins. The cash flows associated with the Digital business in each country were based on the expected Digital revenue for such country and the application of a royalty rate based on current market terms. The cash flows for the Workshops + Digital and Digital businesses were discounted utilizing rates which were calculated using the weighted-average cost of capital, which included the cost of equity and the cost of debt.\nGoodwill\nIn performing the impairment analysis for goodwill, the fair value for our reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. This approach involves projecting future cash flows attributable to the reporting unit and discounting those estimated cash flows using an appropriate discount rate. The estimated fair value is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. We have determined the appropriate reporting unit for purposes of assessing annual impairment to be the country for all reporting units. The net book values of goodwill in the United States, Canada and other countries as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date were $103.0 million, $42.1 million and $10.5 million, respectively.\nFor all of our reporting units tested as of May 3, 2020, we estimated future cash flows by utilizing the historical debt-free cash flows (cash flows provided by operations less capital expenditures) attributable to that country and then applied expected future operating income growth rates for such country. We utilized operating income as the basis for measuring our potential growth because we believe it is the best indicator of the performance of our business. We then discounted the estimated future cash flows utilizing a discount rate which was calculated using the weighted-average cost of capital, which included the cost of equity and the cost of debt.\nIndefinite-Lived Franchise Rights Acquired and Goodwill Annual Impairment Test\nWe review indefinite-lived intangible assets, including franchise rights acquired with indefinite lives, and goodwill for potential impairment on at least an annual basis or more often if events so require. We performed fair value impairment testing as of May 3, 2020 and May 5, 2019, each the first day of fiscal May, on our indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill.\nIn performing our annual impairment analysis as of May 3, 2020 and May 5, 2019, we determined that the carrying amounts of our franchise rights acquired with indefinite lives units of account and goodwill reporting units did not exceed their respective fair values and, therefore, no impairment existed.\nWhen determining fair value, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. A change in these underlying assumptions could cause a change in the results of the impairment assessments and, as such, could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts and result in an impairment of those assets. In the event such a result occurred, we would be required to record a corresponding charge, which would impact earnings. We would also be required to reduce the carrying amounts of the related assets on our balance sheet. We continue to evaluate these assumptions and believe that these assumptions are appropriate.\nIn performing our annual impairment analysis, we also considered the trading value of both our equity and debt. If the trading values of both our equity and debt were to significantly decline from their current levels, we may have to take an impairment charge at the appropriate time, which could be material. For additional information on risks associated with our recognizing asset impairment charges, see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBased on the results of our May 3, 2020 annual franchise rights acquired impairment analysis performed for all of our units of account, except for Canada and New Zealand, as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date, those units had an estimated fair value at least 35% higher than the respective unit's carrying amount. Collectively, these units of account represent 91.9% of our total franchise rights acquired. Based on the results of our annual franchise rights acquired impairment test performed for our Canada unit of account, which holds 7.4% of our franchise rights acquired as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date, the estimated fair value of this unit of account exceeded its carrying value by approximately 16.5%. Based on the results of our annual franchise rights acquired impairment test performed for our New Zealand unit of account, which holds 0.7% of our franchise rights acquired as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date, the estimated fair value of this unit of account exceeded its carrying value by approximately 9.8%. Accordingly, a change in the underlying assumptions for New Zealand may change the results of the impairment assessment and, as such, could result in an impairment of the franchise rights acquired related to New Zealand, for which the net book value was $5.1 million as of January 2, 2021.\nIn performing this impairment analysis for fiscal 2020, for the year of maturity, we assumed Workshops + Digital revenue (comprised of Workshops + Digital Fees and revenues from products sold to members in studios) growth of (30.6%) to (39.3%) in the year of maturity from fiscal 2019, in each case, earned in the applicable country and assumed cumulative annual revenue growth rates for the years beyond the year of maturity of 1.7%. For the year of maturity and beyond, we assumed operating income margin rates of 0.2% to 12.4%.\nBased on the results of our May 3, 2020 annual goodwill impairment test performed for all of our reporting units as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date, there was significant headroom in the goodwill impairment analysis for those units, with the difference between the carrying value and the fair value exceeding 100%.\nThe following are the more significant assumptions utilized in our annual impairment analyses for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt-Free Cumulative Annual Cash Flow Growth Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0% to 13.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBrazil Goodwill Impairment\nWith respect to our Brazil reporting unit, during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we made a strategic decision to shift to an exclusively Digital business in that country. We determined that this decision, together with the negative impact of COVID-19, the ongoing challenging economic environment in Brazil and our reduced expectations regarding the reporting unit's future operating cash flows, required us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis. In performing this discounted cash flow analysis, we determined that the carrying amount of this reporting unit exceeded its fair value and as a result recorded an impairment charge of $3.7 million, which comprises the remaining balance of goodwill for this reporting unit.\nAs it relates to our goodwill impairment analysis for Brazil, we estimated future debt-free cash flows in contemplation of our growth strategies for that market. In developing these projections, we considered the growth strategies under the current market conditions in Brazil. We then discounted the estimated future cash flows utilizing a discount rate which was calculated using the weighted-average cost of capital, which included the cost of equity and the cost of debt.\nOther Critical Accounting Policies\nInformation concerning other critical accounting policies affecting us is set forth in Note 2 of our audited consolidated financial statements, contained in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2020 (53 weeks) COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 (52 weeks)\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31st and consists of either 52- or 53-week periods. Fiscal 2020 contained 53 weeks, while fiscal 2019 contained 52 weeks. The 2020 53rd week, which began on December 27, 2020 and ended on January 2, 2021, contributed 4.3 million, or 1.7%, to Total Paid Weeks for fiscal 2020. It drove additional revenues of $20.9 million, or 1.5%, for fiscal 2020. Due to the timing of the 53rd week, additional marketing expense drove a decline in fiscal 2020 operating income. The 53rd week also resulted in an additional week of interest expense. As a result, in the aggregate the 53rd week had a negative $0.03 per share impact on fiscal 2020 EPS.\nThe table below sets forth selected financial information for fiscal 2020 from our consolidated statements of net income for fiscal 2020 versus selected financial information for fiscal 2019 from our consolidated statements of net income for fiscal 2019.\nSummary of Selected Financial

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d above for an explanation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures. \nConsolidated Results\nRevenues\nRevenues in fiscal 2020 were $1,378.1 million, a decrease of $35.2 million, or 2.5%, versus fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which positively impacted our revenues for fiscal 2020 by $4.7 million, revenues in fiscal 2020 would have decreased 2.8% versus the prior year. This decrease was driven primarily by lower revenues related to Workshops + Digital Fees and in-studio product sales as a result of the closure of our studios and reduced operations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. See -Segment Results\u201d for additional details on revenues.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\nTotal cost of revenues in fiscal 2020 decreased $26.4 million, or 4.2%, versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of $23.3 million of 2020 restructuring charges, total cost of revenues in fiscal 2020 would have decreased by 7.9%, or 8.1% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year. Gross profit decreased $8.8 million, or 1.1%, in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which positively impacted gross profit for fiscal 2020 by $3.6 million, gross profit in fiscal 2020 would have decreased 1.6% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of $23.3 million of 2020 restructuring charges, gross profit in fiscal 2020 would have increased by 1.8%, or 1.4% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year. Gross margin in fiscal 2020 increased 0.8% to 56.4% versus 55.7% in fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of $23.3 million of 2020 restructuring charges, gross margin in fiscal 2020 would have increased 2.5% to 58.1% versus the prior year. Gross margin increase was driven primarily by a mix shift to our higher margin Digital business, offset in part by a contraction of margins in the Workshops + Digital business and lower margins related to consumer product sales.\nMarketing\nMarketing expenses for fiscal 2020 increased $16.7 million, or 6.9%, versus fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which increased marketing expenses for fiscal 2020 by $1.0 million, marketing expenses in fiscal 2020 would have increased 6.4% versus fiscal 2019. This increase in marketing expense was primarily due to fiscal 2020 including a 53rd week, which bridged the last week of December 2020 and ended on January 2, 2021, and had a high concentration of advertising spending. Marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 18.9% in fiscal 2020 as compared to 17.3% in fiscal 2019.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 increased $42.6 million, or 16.7%, versus fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which increased selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 by $0.3 million, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 would have increased 16.6% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of the $32.7 million Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and $9.8 million of 2020 restructuring charges, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 would have been flat, or decreased by 0.1% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2020 increased to 21.6% from 18.0% for fiscal 2019.\nImpairment\nIn performing our interim impairment analysis for our Brazil reporting unit, we determined that, based on the fair values calculated, the carrying amount of goodwill related to our Brazil reporting unit exceeded our fair value and recorded an impairment charge of $3.7 million for fiscal 2020.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for fiscal 2020 decreased $71.8 million, or 24.9%, versus fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which positively impacted operating income for fiscal 2020 by $3.3 million, operating income in fiscal 2020 would have decreased 26.1% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of the $33.1 million of 2020 restructuring charges, the $32.7 million Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the $3.7 million goodwill impairment charge related to our Brazil reporting unit, operating income in fiscal 2020 would have decreased by 0.8%, or 1.6% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year. This decrease in operating income was driven primarily by an increase in marketing expenses, partially offset by an increase in gross profit as compared to the prior year. Operating income margin for fiscal 2020 decreased 4.7% to 15.7% from 20.4% for fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of the 2020 restructuring charges, the Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the goodwill impairment charge, operating income margin in fiscal 2020 would have increased by 0.3%, both as reported and on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year. This slight increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by an increase in gross margin, almost fully offset by an increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, versus the prior year.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in fiscal 2020 decreased $12.0 million, or 8.8%, versus fiscal 2019. The decrease in interest expense was driven primarily by a decrease in our outstanding indebtedness resulting from principal repayments. The effective interest rate on our debt, based on interest incurred (which includes amortization of our deferred financing costs and debt discount) and our average borrowings during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 and excluding the impact of our interest rate swaps then in effect, decreased to 6.94% per annum at fiscal 2020 year end from 8.07% per annum at fiscal 2019 year end. Including the impact of our interest rate swaps then in effect, the effective interest rate on our debt, based on interest incurred (which includes amortization of our deferred financing costs and debt discount) and our average borrowings during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, decreased to 7.72% per annum at fiscal 2020 year end from 8.02% per annum at fiscal 2019 year end. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Long-Term Debt\u201d for additional details regarding our debt, including interest rates and payments thereon. For additional details on our interest rate swaps, see", "item_7_text": "Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d included in Item 6 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, strategies, prospects, objectives, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements discussed in Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read as applying to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, without limitation, those discussed in Risk Factors\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a global wellness company powered by the world's leading commercial weight management program and an award-winning digital subscription platform. We are focused on inspiring people to adopt healthy habits for real life and aim to democratize and deliver wellness for all. With nearly six decades of weight management experience, expertise and know-how, we are one of the most recognized and trusted brand names among weight-conscious consumers. In 2018, we announced new articulations of our brands, including our evolving focus on WW, to further reinforce our mission to focus on overall health and wellness. We educate our members and provide them with guidance and an inspiring community to enable them to develop healthy habits. WW-branded services and products include digital offerings provided through our apps and websites, workshops, consumer products, and various events and experiences. Our business has gone through a significant shift to a digital subscription model over the past several years and our primary sources of revenue are subscriptions for our digital products and for our workshops. Our Digital\u201d business refers to providing subscriptions to our digital product offerings, including Digital 360 and Personal Coaching + Digital. Our Workshops + Digital\u201d (formerly known as Studio + Digital\u201d) business refers to providing unlimited access to our workshops combined with our digital subscription product offerings to commitment plan subscribers. It also includes the provision of access to workshops for members who do not subscribe to commitment plans, including our pay-as-you-go\u201d members.\nWe operate in numerous countries around the world, including through our franchise operations. We have four reportable segments based on an integrated geographical structure as follows: North America, Continental Europe (CE), United Kingdom and Other. See the section entitled Business-Business Organization and Global Operations\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on these reportable segments and the countries in which we operate.\nComponents of our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues principally from:\n \u2022 Subscription Revenues. Our Subscription Revenues\u201d consist of Digital Subscription Revenues\u201d and Workshops + Digital Fees\u201d (formerly known as Studio + Digital Fees\u201d). Digital Subscription Revenues\u201d consist of the fees associated with subscriptions for our Digital offerings, including Digital 360 and Personal Coaching + Digital. Workshops + Digital Fees\u201d consist of the fees associated with our subscription plans for combined workshops and digital offerings and other payment arrangements for access to workshops. \n \u2022 In-studio product sales. We sell a range of consumer products, including bars, snacks, cookbooks and kitchen tools, in our studios. \n \u2022 E-commerce, licensing, franchise royalties and other. We license our trademarks and other intellectual property in certain categories of food, beverages and other relevant consumer products and services. We also co-brand or endorse with carefully selected branded consumer products and services. In addition, our franchisees typically pay us a royalty fee of 10% of their Workshops + Digital fee revenues as well as purchase products for sale in their workshops. \nWe also generate other revenues including revenues from sales of products online through our e-commerce platforms and through our trusted partners and publishing.\nThe following table sets forth our revenues by category for the past three fiscal years.\nRevenue Sources\n(in millions)\n\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\nFrom fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020, our revenues decreased at a compound annual rate of 4.6% driven primarily by a decrease in in-studio product sales. Additional revenue details are as follows:\n \u2022 Subscription Revenues. Subscription Revenues decreased at a compound annual rate of 3.5% from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020 due to a decrease in Workshops + Digital Fees, partially offset by an increase in Digital Subscription Revenues. Our Workshops + Digital products are priced at a premium compared to our Digital products. Workshops + Digital Fees were negatively impacted by the significant recruitment decline in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020 driven by the closure of certain of our studios and the limited reopening of others, as well as the shift in consumer sentiment in the COVID-19 environment. End of Period Subscribers grew in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, in each case on a year-over-year basis. In fiscal 2018, recruitment grew in all of our major markets driven by the successful launch of our program known as WW Freestyle in the majority of our markets. In fiscal 2019, recruitment declined year-over-year due to cycling against the successful launch of the WW Freestyle program and due to the impact of ineffective marketing at the start of fiscal 2019. Despite the negative impact of COVID-19, in fiscal 2020, recruitment grew compared to fiscal 2019 due to the growth in the Digital business, but was lower in total recruitment compared to fiscal 2018 levels. In addition, member retention in the aggregate has improved since fiscal 2018 and was at historic highs in fiscal 2020. Recruitment and retention continue to be a key strategic focus. \n \u2022 In-studio product sales. In-studio product sales decreased at a compound annual rate of 47.9% from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020. From fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019, the decrease in in-studio product sales was driven primarily by a decrease in the number of our Workshops + Digital subscribers. From fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020, the decrease in in-studio product sales was driven primarily by the closure of certain of our studios and the limited reopening of others, as well as the shift in consumer sentiment in the COVID-19 environment. \n \u2022 E-commerce, licensing, franchise royalties and other. All other revenues increased 28.2% on a compound annual rate from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in e-commerce product sales. \nCost of Revenues\nTotal cost of revenues primarily consists of expenses to operate our studios and workshops, costs to sell consumer products and costs to develop and operate our digital products. Operating costs primarily consist of salary expense paid to operations management, commissions and expenses paid to our employees, coaches and guides, studio room rent, customer service costs (both in-house and third-party), program material expenses, depreciation and amortization associated with field automation, credit card and fulfillment fees and training and other expenses. Cost to sell products includes costs of products purchased from our third-party suppliers, inventory reserves, royalties, and inbound and outbound shipping and related costs incurred in making our products available for sale or use. Costs to operate our digital products include salaries and related benefits, depreciation and amortization of website development, credit card processing fees and other costs incurred in developing our digital offerings.\nMarketing Expenses\nMarketing expenses primarily consist of costs to produce advertising and marketing materials as well as media costs to advertise our brand and products across multiple platforms (e.g., broadcast, digital, electronic customer relationship marketing (eCRM), direct mail, social media and public relations), costs paid to third-party agencies who help us develop our marketing campaigns and strategy, expenses in support of market research, as well as costs incurred in connection with local marketing and promotions.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of compensation, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, third-party consulting, temporary help, audit, legal and litigation expenses as well as facility costs and depreciation and amortization of systems in support of the business infrastructure and offices globally. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include amortization expense of certain of our intangible assets and certain one-time transaction expenses.\nGross Margin\nThe following table sets forth our gross profit and gross margin for the past three fiscal years, as adjusted for fiscal 2020 to exclude the impact of the charges associated with our previously disclosed 2020 organizational restructuring plan:\n\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n (1) The As adjusted\u201d measure is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts the consolidated statements of net income for fiscal 2020 to exclude the impact of the $23.3 million ($17.4 million after tax) of 2020 restructuring charges. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for an explanation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures. \nIn fiscal 2020, excluding the impact of the 2020 restructuring charges, the gross margin increase from fiscal 2019 was driven primarily by a mix shift to our higher margin Digital business, offset in part by a contraction of margins in the Workshops + Digital business and lower margins related to consumer product sales.\nIn fiscal 2019, the gross margin decrease from fiscal 2018 was driven primarily by decreased operating leverage across our businesses, partially offset by a mix shift to the higher margin Digital business.\nOperating Income Margin\nThe following table sets forth our operating income for the past three fiscal years, as adjusted for fiscal 2020 to exclude the impact of the 2020 restructuring charges, the Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the impairment charge for our goodwill related to our Brazil reporting unit, as applicable:\n\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n (1) The As adjusted\u201d measure is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts the consolidated statements of net income for fiscal 2020 to exclude the impact of the $33.1 million ($24.8 million after tax) of 2020 restructuring charges, the $32.7 million ($24.5 million after tax) Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the $3.7 million ($2.7 million after tax) goodwill impairment charge related to our Brazil reporting unit. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for an explanation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures. \nIn fiscal 2020, excluding the impact of the 2020 restructuring charges, the Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the goodwill impairment charge, the slight increase in operating income margin from fiscal 2019 was driven primarily by an increase in gross margin, almost fully offset by an increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nIn fiscal 2019, the decrease in operating income margin from fiscal 2018 was driven primarily by an increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue, by a decrease in gross margin and by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nMaterial Trends\nPerformance Indicators\nOur management team regularly reviews and analyzes a number of financial and operating metrics, including the key performance indicators listed below, in order to manage our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, determine the allocation of resources, make decisions regarding corporate strategies and assess the quality and potential variability of our cash flows and earnings. We also believe that these key performance indicators are useful to both management and investors for forecasting purposes and to facilitate comparisons to our historical operating results. These metrics are supplemental to our GAAP results and include operational measures.\n \u2022 Revenues-Our Subscription Revenues\u201d consist of Digital Subscription Revenues\u201d and Workshops + Digital Fees\u201d. Digital Subscription Revenues\u201d consist of the fees associated with subscriptions for our Digital offerings, including Digital 360 and Personal Coaching + Digital. Workshops + Digital Fees\u201d consist of the fees associated with our subscription plans for combined workshops and digital offerings and other payment arrangements for access to workshops. In addition, product sales and other\u201d consists of sales of consumer products via e-commerce, in studios and through our trusted partners, revenues from licensing and publishing, other revenues (including revenues from the WW Presents: Oprah's 2020 Vision tour), and, in the case of the consolidated financial results and Other reportable segment, franchise fees with respect to commitment plans and royalties. \n \u2022 Paid Weeks-The Paid Weeks\u201d metric reports paid weeks by WW customers in Company-owned operations for a given period as follows: (i) Digital Paid Weeks\u201d is the total paid subscription weeks for our digital subscription products (including Digital 360 and Personal Coaching + Digital); (ii) Workshops + Digital Paid Weeks\u201d (formerly known as Studio + Digital Paid Weeks\u201d) is the sum of total paid commitment plan weeks which include workshops and digital offerings and total pay-as-you-go\u201d weeks; and (iii) Total Paid Weeks\u201d is the sum of Digital Paid Weeks and Workshops + Digital Paid Weeks. \n \u2022 Incoming Subscribers- Subscribers\u201d refer to Digital subscribers and Workshops + Digital subscribers who participate in recur bill programs in Company-owned operations. The Incoming Subscribers\u201d metric reports WW subscribers in Company-owned operations at a given period start as follows: (i) Incoming Digital Subscribers\u201d is the total number of Digital, including Digital 360 and Personal Coaching + Digital, subscribers; (ii) Incoming Workshops + Digital Subscribers\u201d (formerly known as Incoming Studio + Digital Subscribers\u201d) is the total number of commitment plan subscribers that have access to combined workshops and digital offerings; and (iii) Incoming Subscribers\u201d is the sum of Incoming Digital Subscribers and Incoming Workshops + Digital Subscribers. Recruitment and retention are key drivers for this metric. \n \u2022 End of Period Subscribers-The End of Period Subscribers\u201d metric reports WW subscribers in Company-owned operations at a given period end as follows: (i) End of Period Digital Subscribers\u201d is the total number of Digital, including Digital 360 and Personal Coaching + Digital, subscribers; (ii) End of Period Workshops + Digital Subscribers\u201d (formerly known as End of Period Studio + Digital Subscribers\u201d) is the total number of commitment plan subscribers that have access to combined workshops and digital offerings; and (iii) End of Period Subscribers\u201d is the sum of End of Period Digital Subscribers and End of Period Workshops + Digital Subscribers. Recruitment and retention are key drivers for this metric. \n \u2022 Gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. \nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread globally and to impact our business operations and the markets in which we operate. While the outbreak of COVID-19 did not have a significant effect on our reported results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020, it did have a significant effect on our reported results for the remainder of fiscal 2020. The pandemic initially caused a significant decline in recruitments for both our Digital and our Workshops + Digital businesses, beginning in the middle of March 2020, as compared to the prior year period. Starting in the middle of April 2020, Digital recruitment trends returned to growth and full year fiscal 2020 Digital recruitments were higher as compared to the prior year. Our Workshops + Digital business continued to experience significant declines in recruitments as compared to the prior year through the end of fiscal 2020, a trend that is expected to continue in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and potentially in subsequent periods. With approximately 90% of recruitments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 coming from our Digital business, the recruitment mix shift in the quarter reflected the strength of our Digital business and the closure of certain of our studios as well as the limited re-opening of others. This trend in Workshops + Digital recruitments throughout the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted revenues in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior year. The pandemic did not materially impact our member cancellation rates or overall member retention year-over-year. These trends are reflected in the number of End of Period Subscribers for fiscal 2020, which was up 4% as compared to the prior year, consisting of 3.7 million Digital subscribers and 0.7 million Workshops + Digital subscribers.\nThe extent to which our operations and business trends will continue in future periods to be impacted by, and any unforeseen costs will result from, the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. These developments include, among other things, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the outbreak, health implications and vaccine availability, actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, and changes in consumer behavior resulting from the outbreak and such government actions. We continue to actively monitor the ongoing global outbreak of COVID-19 and its impact and related developments and expect, similar to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, that it will significantly impact our reported results for the first half of fiscal 2021 and may potentially do so in subsequent periods.\nIn response to the public health crisis posed by COVID-19, we suspended our in-person workshops and moved quickly to transition these workshops to an entirely virtual experience. In June 2020, we began a phased re-opening with reduced operations of a limited number of our studio locations. We continue to evolve our workshop strategy as we evaluate our cost structure and respond to shifting consumer sentiment. We are selectively resuming in-person workshops where we can in a cost-efficient manner that promotes the health and safety of our employees and members. However, during these uncertain times, we may need to close re-opened studios, may not be able to open studios as planned or may need to further reduce operations. We continue to serve our members virtually, both via our Digital business and through virtual workshops now available to our Workshops + Digital subscribers. Nevertheless, our business operations, recruitment trends with respect to our Workshops + Digital business and in-studio product sales remain substantially affected by our reduced operations. We expect that applicable regulatory restrictions, including continued or reinstated stay-at-home requirements and restrictions on in-person group gatherings, may impact our studio operations, including how we conduct our in-person workshops.\nAs we continue to address the impact of the pandemic, and the related evolving legal and consumer landscape, we are focused on how to best meet our members' and consumers' needs as restrictions are lifted or reinstated. We consolidated certain of our studios into branded studio locations and continue to close certain other branded studio locations. The decision to re-open a studio location, if at all, or further consolidate studio locations, will be influenced by a number of factors, including applicable legal restrictions, consumer confidence and preferences, changes in consumer behavior, and the protection of the health and safety of our employees and members, and will be dependent on cost efficiencies and alignment with our digital and brand strategy. The current number of our studio locations is significantly lower than that prior to the pandemic, and we expect it to remain below pre-COVID-19 levels for the foreseeable future. As a result, we have incurred and will incur significant costs associated with our real estate realignment.\nDue to the negative impact of COVID-19, and the uncertainty of the full extent of the magnitude and duration of such impact on our business and the economies and financial markets in which we operate, in fiscal 2020 we implemented a $100.0 million cost-savings initiative with respect to our cost structure. We undertook this initiative to proactively manage our liquidity so we can maintain flexibility to respond to evolving business and consumer conditions arising from the pandemic, as well as continue to fund investments in innovating our program and long-term debt obligations. Additionally, in June 2020, we amended our Credit Agreement (as defined below) to relax the requirements of the financial maintenance covenant until the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022 so as to provide additional flexibility for accessing liquidity available under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Long-Term Debt-Senior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d for additional details on this amendment. We expect to continue to assess the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and intend to refine our cost structure and resource allocation accordingly. For additional information on our cash flows and long-term debt, see -Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWhile we expect the effects of the pandemic and the related responses to negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position, the uncertainty of the full extent of the duration and severity of the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 means we cannot reasonably estimate the related financial impact at this time. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We continue to believe that our powerful communities and our ability to inspire people to adopt healthy habits will be invaluable to people across the globe as they continue to acclimate to new social and economic environments, and that they uniquely position us in the markets in which we operate.\nMarket Trends\nWe believe that our revenues and profitability can be sensitive to major trends in the wellness and weight management industries. In particular, we believe that our business could be adversely impacted by:\n \u2022 increased competition from weight loss and wellness apps; \n \u2022 increased consumer interest in fad diets and weight loss trends; \n \u2022 the development of more effective or more favorably perceived weight management methods or technologies, including by the pharmaceutical, genetics and biotechnology industries; \n \u2022 a failure to develop and market new, innovative services and products, to enhance our existing services and products, or to successfully expand into new channels of distribution or respond to consumer trends, including consumer focus on integrated lifestyle and fitness approaches; \n \u2022 a failure to successfully implement new strategic initiatives; \n \u2022 a decrease in the effectiveness of our marketing, advertising, and social media programs or an increase in the effectiveness of our competitors' similar programs; \n \u2022 an impairment of our brands and other intellectual property; \n \u2022 a failure of our technology or systems to perform as designed; \n \u2022 any event or condition, including health epidemics and natural disasters, that may discourage or impede people from gathering with others or accessing resources; and \n \u2022 a downturn in general economic conditions or consumer confidence. \nNorth America Metrics and Business Trends\nIn fiscal 2018, North America Total Paid Weeks increased 26.3% versus the prior year. The increase in North America Total Paid Weeks was driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2018 versus the beginning of fiscal 2017, higher Digital recruitments versus the prior year driven by the successful launch of the WW Freestyle program, and improved retention versus the prior year.\nIn fiscal 2019, North America Total Paid Weeks increased 0.3% versus the prior year. The slight increase in North America Total Paid Weeks was driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2019 versus the beginning of fiscal 2018, partially offset by lower recruitments versus the prior year. A weak recruitment start to fiscal 2019 was driven by cycling against the launch of the WW Freestyle program and ineffective marketing in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2019 year-over-year recruitment trends improved through the year and, with the impact of the launch of the myWW program in mid-November 2019, the recruitment trend turned positive in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 versus the prior year period.\nIn fiscal 2020, North America Total Paid Weeks increased 8.1% versus the prior year. The increase in North America Total Paid Weeks was driven primarily by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2020 versus the beginning of fiscal 2019 and higher Digital recruitments in fiscal 2020 versus the prior year. Despite the negative impact of COVID-19, Digital recruitments were higher in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior year, driven by the successful launch of the new myWW program, the appeal of the program and our digital tools, and strong marketing execution versus the prior year. Workshops + Digital recruitments significantly declined in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nContinental Europe Metrics and Business Trends\nIn fiscal 2018, Continental Europe Total Paid Weeks increased 30.6% versus the prior year, driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2018 versus the beginning of fiscal 2017, higher recruitments versus the prior year driven by the successful launch of the WW Freestyle program, and improved retention versus the prior year.\nIn fiscal 2019, Continental Europe Total Paid Weeks increased 11.7% versus the prior year, driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2019 versus the beginning of fiscal 2018. A weak recruitment start to fiscal 2019 was driven by cycling against the launch of the WW Freestyle program in local markets and ineffective marketing in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2019 year-over-year recruitment trends were negative in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 versus the prior year period, and turned positive in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and remained so through the rest of the year.\nIn fiscal 2020, Continental Europe Total Paid Weeks increased 12.5% versus the prior year, driven primarily by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2020 versus the beginning of fiscal 2019 and higher Digital recruitments in fiscal 2020 versus the prior year. Despite the negative impact of COVID-19, Digital recruitments were higher in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior year, driven by the successful launch of the new myWW program, the appeal of the program and our digital tools, and strong marketing execution versus the prior year. Workshops + Digital recruitments significantly declined in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nUnited Kingdom Metrics and Business Trends\nIn fiscal 2018, UK Total Paid Weeks increased 13.2% versus the prior year. The increase in UK Total Paid Weeks was driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2018 versus the beginning of fiscal 2017, recruitment strength in our Digital business versus the prior year driven by the successful launch of the WW Freestyle program, and improved retention versus the prior year.\nIn fiscal 2019, UK Total Paid Weeks increased 3.4% versus the prior year. The increase in UK Total Paid Weeks was driven by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2019 versus the beginning of fiscal 2018 and improved retention versus the prior year, partially offset by lower recruitments versus the prior year. A weak recruitment start to fiscal 2019 was driven by cycling against the launch of the WW Freestyle program and ineffective marketing in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2019 year-over-year recruitment trends improved through the year and, with the impact of the launch of the myWW program in mid-November 2019, the recruitment trend turned positive in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 versus the prior year period.\nIn fiscal 2020, UK Total Paid Weeks decreased 1.2% versus the prior year. The decrease in UK Total Paid Weeks was driven primarily by lower Workshops + Digital recruitments, partially offset by the higher number of Incoming Subscribers at the beginning of fiscal 2020 versus the beginning of fiscal 2019 and higher Digital recruitments in fiscal 2020 versus the prior year. Despite the negative impact of COVID-19, Digital recruitments were higher in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior year, driven by the successful launch of the new myWW program, the appeal of the program and our digital tools, and strong marketing execution versus the prior year. Workshops + Digital recruitments significantly declined in fiscal 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, we have disclosed non-GAAP financial measures of operating results that exclude or adjust certain items. Gross profit, gross profit margin, operating income and operating income margin are discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K both as reported (on a GAAP basis) and as adjusted (on a non-GAAP basis), as applicable, with respect to fiscal 2020 to exclude the impact of the 2020 restructuring charges, the Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the goodwill impairment charge related to our Brazil reporting unit. We generally refer to such non-GAAP measures as excluding or adjusting for the impact of the 2020 restructuring charges, the Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the goodwill impairment charge. We also present within this Annual Report on Form 10-K the non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation ( EBITDAS\u201d); earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, 2020 restructuring charges and goodwill impairment ( Adjusted EBITDAS\u201d); total debt less unamortized deferred financing costs, unamortized debt discount and cash on hand (i.e., net debt); and a net debt/Adjusted EBITAS ratio. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-EBITDAS, Adjusted EBITDAS and Net Debt\u201d for the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure in each case. Our management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the performance of our business and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of the performance of our business. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similarly entitled measures reported by other companies.\nUse of Constant Currency\nAs exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe in certain cases the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors' ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we calculate constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding or adjusting for the impact of foreign currency or being on a constant currency basis. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP and are not meant to be considered in isolation. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to inventories, the impairment analysis for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, share-based compensation, income taxes, tax contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most significant judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised services or goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services or goods.\nWe earn revenue from subscriptions for our digital products and by conducting workshops, for which we charge a fee, predominantly through commitment plans, as well as prepayment plans or the pay-as-you-go\u201d arrangement. We also earn revenue by selling consumer products online through our e-commerce platforms, at our studios and through our trusted partners; collecting royalties from franchisees; collecting royalties related to licensing agreements; and publishing.\nCommitment plan revenues and prepaid workshop fees are recorded to revenue on a straight-line basis as control is transferred since these performance obligations are satisfied over time. Digital Subscription Revenues, consisting of the fees associated with subscriptions for our Digital products, including Digital 360 and Personal Coaching + Digital, are recognized on a straight-line basis as control is transferred since these performance obligations are satisfied over time. One-time Digital sign-up fees are considered immaterial in the context of the contract and the related revenue is amortized into revenue over the commitment period. Workshops + Digital Fees, consisting of the fees associated with subscription plans for combined workshops and digital offerings and other payment arrangements for access to workshops, are recognized on a straight-line basis as control is transferred since these performance obligations are satisfied over time. In the Workshops + Digital business, we generally charge non-refundable registration and starter fees in exchange for access to our digital subscription products, an introductory information session and materials we provide to new members. Revenue from these registration and starter fees is considered immaterial in the context of the contract and is amortized into revenue over the commitment period. Revenue from consumer product sales online through e-commerce platforms and at studios, royalties and commissions, and pay-as-you-go\u201d workshop fees is recognized at the point in time control is transferred, which is when products are shipped to customers and partners and title and risk of loss passes to them, royalties and commissions are earned, and services are rendered, respectively. For revenue transactions that involve multiple performance obligations, the amount of revenue recognized is determined using the relative fair value approach, which is generally based on each performance obligation's stand-alone selling price. Discounts to customers, including free registration offers, are recorded as a deduction from gross revenue in the period such revenue was recognized.\nWe grant refunds in aggregate amounts that historically have not been material. Because the period of payment of the refund generally approximates the period revenue was originally recognized, refunds are recorded as a reduction of revenue over the same period.\nFranchise Rights Acquired\nFinite-lived franchise rights acquired are amortized over the remaining contractual period, which is generally less than one year. Indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired are tested on an annual basis for impairment.\nIn performing the impairment analysis for our indefinite-lived franchise rights acquired, the fair value for our franchise rights acquired is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach referred to as the hypothetical start-up approach for our franchise rights related to our Workshops + Digital business and a relief from royalty methodology for our franchise rights related to our Digital business. The aggregate estimated fair value for these rights is then compared to the carrying value of the unit of account for those franchise rights. We have determined the appropriate unit of account for purposes of assessing impairment to be the combination of the rights in both the Workshops + Digital business and the Digital business in the country in which the applicable acquisition occurred. The net book values of these franchise rights in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date were $681.5 million, $56.7 million, $12.3 million, $6.9 million, and $5.1 million, respectively.\nIn our hypothetical start-up approach analysis for fiscal 2020, we assumed that the year of maturity was reached after 7 years. Subsequent to the year of maturity, we estimated future cash flows for the Workshops + Digital business in each country based on assumptions regarding revenue growth and operating income margins. The cash flows associated with the Digital business in each country were based on the expected Digital revenue for such country and the application of a royalty rate based on current market terms. The cash flows for the Workshops + Digital and Digital businesses were discounted utilizing rates which were calculated using the weighted-average cost of capital, which included the cost of equity and the cost of debt.\nGoodwill\nIn performing the impairment analysis for goodwill, the fair value for our reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. This approach involves projecting future cash flows attributable to the reporting unit and discounting those estimated cash flows using an appropriate discount rate. The estimated fair value is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. We have determined the appropriate reporting unit for purposes of assessing annual impairment to be the country for all reporting units. The net book values of goodwill in the United States, Canada and other countries as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date were $103.0 million, $42.1 million and $10.5 million, respectively.\nFor all of our reporting units tested as of May 3, 2020, we estimated future cash flows by utilizing the historical debt-free cash flows (cash flows provided by operations less capital expenditures) attributable to that country and then applied expected future operating income growth rates for such country. We utilized operating income as the basis for measuring our potential growth because we believe it is the best indicator of the performance of our business. We then discounted the estimated future cash flows utilizing a discount rate which was calculated using the weighted-average cost of capital, which included the cost of equity and the cost of debt.\nIndefinite-Lived Franchise Rights Acquired and Goodwill Annual Impairment Test\nWe review indefinite-lived intangible assets, including franchise rights acquired with indefinite lives, and goodwill for potential impairment on at least an annual basis or more often if events so require. We performed fair value impairment testing as of May 3, 2020 and May 5, 2019, each the first day of fiscal May, on our indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill.\nIn performing our annual impairment analysis as of May 3, 2020 and May 5, 2019, we determined that the carrying amounts of our franchise rights acquired with indefinite lives units of account and goodwill reporting units did not exceed their respective fair values and, therefore, no impairment existed.\nWhen determining fair value, we utilize various assumptions, including projections of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. A change in these underlying assumptions could cause a change in the results of the impairment assessments and, as such, could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts and result in an impairment of those assets. In the event such a result occurred, we would be required to record a corresponding charge, which would impact earnings. We would also be required to reduce the carrying amounts of the related assets on our balance sheet. We continue to evaluate these assumptions and believe that these assumptions are appropriate.\nIn performing our annual impairment analysis, we also considered the trading value of both our equity and debt. If the trading values of both our equity and debt were to significantly decline from their current levels, we may have to take an impairment charge at the appropriate time, which could be material. For additional information on risks associated with our recognizing asset impairment charges, see Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBased on the results of our May 3, 2020 annual franchise rights acquired impairment analysis performed for all of our units of account, except for Canada and New Zealand, as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date, those units had an estimated fair value at least 35% higher than the respective unit's carrying amount. Collectively, these units of account represent 91.9% of our total franchise rights acquired. Based on the results of our annual franchise rights acquired impairment test performed for our Canada unit of account, which holds 7.4% of our franchise rights acquired as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date, the estimated fair value of this unit of account exceeded its carrying value by approximately 16.5%. Based on the results of our annual franchise rights acquired impairment test performed for our New Zealand unit of account, which holds 0.7% of our franchise rights acquired as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date, the estimated fair value of this unit of account exceeded its carrying value by approximately 9.8%. Accordingly, a change in the underlying assumptions for New Zealand may change the results of the impairment assessment and, as such, could result in an impairment of the franchise rights acquired related to New Zealand, for which the net book value was $5.1 million as of January 2, 2021.\nIn performing this impairment analysis for fiscal 2020, for the year of maturity, we assumed Workshops + Digital revenue (comprised of Workshops + Digital Fees and revenues from products sold to members in studios) growth of (30.6%) to (39.3%) in the year of maturity from fiscal 2019, in each case, earned in the applicable country and assumed cumulative annual revenue growth rates for the years beyond the year of maturity of 1.7%. For the year of maturity and beyond, we assumed operating income margin rates of 0.2% to 12.4%.\nBased on the results of our May 3, 2020 annual goodwill impairment test performed for all of our reporting units as of the January 2, 2021 balance sheet date, there was significant headroom in the goodwill impairment analysis for those units, with the difference between the carrying value and the fair value exceeding 100%.\nThe following are the more significant assumptions utilized in our annual impairment analyses for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019:\n\nBrazil Goodwill Impairment\nWith respect to our Brazil reporting unit, during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we made a strategic decision to shift to an exclusively Digital business in that country. We determined that this decision, together with the negative impact of COVID-19, the ongoing challenging economic environment in Brazil and our reduced expectations regarding the reporting unit's future operating cash flows, required us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis. In performing this discounted cash flow analysis, we determined that the carrying amount of this reporting unit exceeded its fair value and as a result recorded an impairment charge of $3.7 million, which comprises the remaining balance of goodwill for this reporting unit.\nAs it relates to our goodwill impairment analysis for Brazil, we estimated future debt-free cash flows in contemplation of our growth strategies for that market. In developing these projections, we considered the growth strategies under the current market conditions in Brazil. We then discounted the estimated future cash flows utilizing a discount rate which was calculated using the weighted-average cost of capital, which included the cost of equity and the cost of debt.\nOther Critical Accounting Policies\nInformation concerning other critical accounting policies affecting us is set forth in Note 2 of our audited consolidated financial statements, contained in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2020 (53 weeks) COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 (52 weeks)\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to December 31st and consists of either 52- or 53-week periods. Fiscal 2020 contained 53 weeks, while fiscal 2019 contained 52 weeks. The 2020 53rd week, which began on December 27, 2020 and ended on January 2, 2021, contributed 4.3 million, or 1.7%, to Total Paid Weeks for fiscal 2020. It drove additional revenues of $20.9 million, or 1.5%, for fiscal 2020. Due to the timing of the 53rd week, additional marketing expense drove a decline in fiscal 2020 operating income. The 53rd week also resulted in an additional week of interest expense. As a result, in the aggregate the 53rd week had a negative $0.03 per share impact on fiscal 2020 EPS.\nThe table below sets forth selected financial information for fiscal 2020 from our consolidated statements of net income for fiscal 2020 versus selected financial information for fiscal 2019 from our consolidated statements of net income for fiscal 2019.\nSummary of Selected Financial Data\n\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\nCertain results for fiscal 2020 are adjusted to exclude the impact of the $33.1 million of 2020 restructuring charges, the $32.7 million Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the $3.7 million goodwill impairment charge related to our Brazil reporting unit. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d above. The table below sets forth a reconciliation of certain of those components of our selected financial data for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2021 which have been adjusted.\n\nNote: Totals may not sum due to rounding.\n (1) The As adjusted\u201d measure is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts the consolidated statements of net income for fiscal 2020 to exclude the impact of the $33.1 million ($24.8 million after tax) of 2020 restructuring charges, the $32.7 million ($24.5 million after tax) Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the $3.7 million ($2.7 million after tax) goodwill impairment charge. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d above for an explanation of our use of non-GAAP financial measures. \nConsolidated Results\nRevenues\nRevenues in fiscal 2020 were $1,378.1 million, a decrease of $35.2 million, or 2.5%, versus fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which positively impacted our revenues for fiscal 2020 by $4.7 million, revenues in fiscal 2020 would have decreased 2.8% versus the prior year. This decrease was driven primarily by lower revenues related to Workshops + Digital Fees and in-studio product sales as a result of the closure of our studios and reduced operations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. See -Segment Results\u201d for additional details on revenues.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\nTotal cost of revenues in fiscal 2020 decreased $26.4 million, or 4.2%, versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of $23.3 million of 2020 restructuring charges, total cost of revenues in fiscal 2020 would have decreased by 7.9%, or 8.1% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year. Gross profit decreased $8.8 million, or 1.1%, in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which positively impacted gross profit for fiscal 2020 by $3.6 million, gross profit in fiscal 2020 would have decreased 1.6% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of $23.3 million of 2020 restructuring charges, gross profit in fiscal 2020 would have increased by 1.8%, or 1.4% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year. Gross margin in fiscal 2020 increased 0.8% to 56.4% versus 55.7% in fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of $23.3 million of 2020 restructuring charges, gross margin in fiscal 2020 would have increased 2.5% to 58.1% versus the prior year. Gross margin increase was driven primarily by a mix shift to our higher margin Digital business, offset in part by a contraction of margins in the Workshops + Digital business and lower margins related to consumer product sales.\nMarketing\nMarketing expenses for fiscal 2020 increased $16.7 million, or 6.9%, versus fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which increased marketing expenses for fiscal 2020 by $1.0 million, marketing expenses in fiscal 2020 would have increased 6.4% versus fiscal 2019. This increase in marketing expense was primarily due to fiscal 2020 including a 53rd week, which bridged the last week of December 2020 and ended on January 2, 2021, and had a high concentration of advertising spending. Marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 18.9% in fiscal 2020 as compared to 17.3% in fiscal 2019.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 increased $42.6 million, or 16.7%, versus fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which increased selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 by $0.3 million, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 would have increased 16.6% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of the $32.7 million Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and $9.8 million of 2020 restructuring charges, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2020 would have been flat, or decreased by 0.1% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2020 increased to 21.6% from 18.0% for fiscal 2019.\nImpairment\nIn performing our interim impairment analysis for our Brazil reporting unit, we determined that, based on the fair values calculated, the carrying amount of goodwill related to our Brazil reporting unit exceeded our fair value and recorded an impairment charge of $3.7 million for fiscal 2020.\nOperating Income\nOperating income for fiscal 2020 decreased $71.8 million, or 24.9%, versus fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, which positively impacted operating income for fiscal 2020 by $3.3 million, operating income in fiscal 2020 would have decreased 26.1% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of the $33.1 million of 2020 restructuring charges, the $32.7 million Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the $3.7 million goodwill impairment charge related to our Brazil reporting unit, operating income in fiscal 2020 would have decreased by 0.8%, or 1.6% on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year. This decrease in operating income was driven primarily by an increase in marketing expenses, partially offset by an increase in gross profit as compared to the prior year. Operating income margin for fiscal 2020 decreased 4.7% to 15.7% from 20.4% for fiscal 2019. Excluding the impact of the 2020 restructuring charges, the Winfrey Stock Compensation expense and the goodwill impairment charge, operating income margin in fiscal 2020 would have increased by 0.3%, both as reported and on a constant currency basis, versus the prior year. This slight increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by an increase in gross margin, almost fully offset by an increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue, versus the prior year.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in fiscal 2020 decreased $12.0 million, or 8.8%, versus fiscal 2019. The decrease in interest expense was driven primarily by a decrease in our outstanding indebtedness resulting from principal repayments. The effective interest rate on our debt, based on interest incurred (which includes amortization of our deferred financing costs and debt discount) and our average borrowings during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 and excluding the impact of our interest rate swaps then in effect, decreased to 6.94% per annum at fiscal 2020 year end from 8.07% per annum at fiscal 2019 year end. Including the impact of our interest rate swaps then in effect, the effective interest rate on our debt, based on interest incurred (which includes amortization of our deferred financing costs and debt discount) and our average borrowings during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, decreased to 7.72% per annum at fiscal 2020 year end from 8.02% per annum at fiscal 2019 year end. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Long-Term Debt\u201d for additional details regarding our debt, including interest rates and payments thereon.

(formerly known as Weight Watchers) covers their financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year 2020 compared to 2019. Readers should also consider the consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as the forward-looking statements risks discussed elsewhere in the report.\n\nHere's a summary of key points from the detailed report:\n\n- WW International is a global wellness company with an emphasis on weight management programs and digital subscription platforms, known for its WW brand that evolved from Weight Watchers.\n- They have experienced a significant shift to digital subscriptions and generate revenue mainly through digital product subscriptions and workshops.\n- The company operates globally through franchising and has four reportable segments: North America, Continental Europe (CE), United Kingdom, and Other.\n- Revenue decreased by 2.5% to $1,378.1 million in fiscal 2020, primarily due to a decrease in in-studio product sales and subscription revenues related to the COVID-19 pandemic impacts.\n- Gross profit margin increased slightly from 55.7% to 56.4% due to a shift to higher margin digital business, despite decreases in gross profit and operating income.\n- Fiscal 2020 saw an increase in marketing expenses by 6.9%, mainly due to the additional 53rd week with concentrated advertising spending.\n- Operating income decreased by 24.9%, negatively influenced by restructuring charges, a Winfrey stock compensation expense, and impairment charges related to the Brazil reporting unit.\n- Interest expense decreased by 8.8% due to lower average indebtedness from principal repayments.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the business operations, especially the workshops and the recruitment trends within the Workshops + Digital business.\n- The report mentions several key performance indicators that management regularly reviews, such as Revenues, Paid Weeks, Incoming Subscribers, End of Period Subscribers, gross profit, and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.\n- WW International adapted to the COVID-19 restrictions by transitioning in-person workshops to virtual experiences and selectively resuming in-person workshops where possible.\n- The COVID-19 response also included a $100.0 million cost-savings initiative and amending the Credit Agreement to maintain flexibility.\n- The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on WW International's operations and trends may continue well into 2021 and subsequent periods.\n\nThe report also emphasizes the use of non-GAAP financial measures and constant currency to evaluate performance, which excludes certain items like restructuring charges, stock compensation expense, and goodwill impairment for a clearer comparison with previous periods. Additionally, the report reviews critical accounting policies such as revenue recognition and impairment analysis for indefinite-lived assets and goodwill."}
