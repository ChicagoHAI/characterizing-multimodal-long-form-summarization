Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThis discussion and analysis reflects Kearny Financial Corp.'s consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data, and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding Kearny Financial Corp. and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nFinancial Condition. Total assets increased $318.1 million to $4.82 billion at June 30, 2017 from $4.50 billion at June 30, 2016. The increase in total assets reflected an increase in net loans receivable that was partially offset by decreases in securities and cash and cash equivalents. The increase in total assets was largely funded by increases in deposits and borrowings that were partially offset by a decrease in stockholders' equity. The decrease in stockholders' equity primarily reflected the Company's share repurchases that outpaced the accretion from earnings during the year.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2017, loans receivable, excluding loans held for sale, increased by $571.3 million to $3.25 billion, or 72.8% of earning assets, at June 30, 2017 from $2.67 billion, or 64.6% of earning assets, at June 30, 2016. The growth in loans during fiscal 2017 continued to reflect our strategic emphasis in growing our commercial loan portfolio, including multi-family loans, nonresidential mortgage loans and commercial business loans. The increase in commercial mortgage and commercial business loans during fiscal 2017 totaled $622.9 million, or 32.0%, to $2.57 billion, or 79.3% of total loans at June 30, 2017, from $1.95 billion, or 73.0% of total loans, at June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, one- to four-family mortgage loans, including first mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, decreased by $44.6 million to $650.1 million, or 20.1% of total loans, from $694.8 million, or 26.0% of total loans.\nFor those same comparative periods, total securities decreased by $146.1 million to $1.11 billion, or 24.9% of earning assets, at June 30, 2017 from $1.26 billion, or 30.3% of earning assets, at June 30, 2016. We generally maintained the overall composition of our securities portfolio during fiscal 2017 while adding subordinated debt as an eligible non-mortgage-backed security sector within the portfolio. However, for interest rate risk management purposes, security balances were modestly reallocated during fiscal 2017 to increase investment in shorter duration, floating-rate sectors within the non-mortgage-backed securities portfolio while investment in comparatively longer duration, fixed-rate securities in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio declined. Non-mortgage-backed securities, including U.S. agency debentures, corporate bonds, single-issuer trust preferred securities, collateralized loan obligations, municipal obligations, subordinated debt, and asset-backed securities, increased by $32.2 million to $589.2 million, or 53.2% of securities, at June 30, 2017 from $557.1 million, or 44.5% of securities, at June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the balance of mortgage-backed securities, primarily comprising U.S. government and agency pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, decreased by $175.9 million to $517.9 million, or 46.8% of securities, from $693.7 million, or 55.5% of securities.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2017, our total deposits increased by $235.3 million to $2.93 billion from $2.69 billion at June 30, 2016. The net increase in deposits reflected a $151.7 million increase in the balance of non-maturity deposits, including a $28.7 million increase in the balance of non-interest-bearing accounts, coupled with an $83.6 million increase in certificates of deposit.\nThe balance of borrowings increased by $191.8 million to $806.2 million at June 30, 2017 from $614.4 million at June 30, 2016. The increase in borrowings was primarily attributable to a $196.9 million net increase in FHLB advances representing new advances drawn to fund a portion of the loan growth reported during fiscal 2017 that were partially offset by the balance of advances repaid during the year. Interest rate derivatives were used to effectively extend duration of the new borrowings drawn for interest rate risk management purposes. The increase in borrowings was partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in the balance of overnight borrowings in the form of depositor sweep accounts.\nStockholders' equity decreased by $90.4 million to $1.06 billion at June 30, 2017 from $1.15 billion at June 30, 2016. The decrease in stockholders' equity largely reflected the impact of the Company's share repurchases during fiscal 2017. For the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company repurchased a total of 8,886,627 shares, at a total cost of $126.0 million, or an average cost of 14.18 per share. The noted decrease in stockholders' equity was partially offset by net income of $18.6 million, from which cash dividends of $8.4 million were declared and payable to shareholders during fiscal 2017. The change in stockholders' equity also reflected a $17.8 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income arising from changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities and derivatives portfolios and a $1.9 million decrease in unearned ESOP reflecting the effects of shares earned by plan participants during the year.\nResults of Operations. Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.\nIt is a function of the average balances of loans and investments versus deposits and borrowed funds outstanding in any one period and the yields earned on those loans and investments and the cost of those deposits and borrowed funds. Our results of operations are also affected by our provision for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense.\nNet income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was $18.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share; an increase of $2.8 million from $15.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.\nOur net interest income increased $7.6 million to $102.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $95.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected a $12.2 million increase in interest income to $139.1 million from $126.9 million. The increase in interest income primarily reflected an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets coupled with an increase in their average yield. For the year ended June 30, 2017, the average balance of interest-earning assets increased by $200.6 million to $4.25 billion compared to $4.05 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average yield on interest-earning assets increased by 14 basis points to 3.27% from 3.13%.\nThe increase in interest income for the year ended June 30, 2017 was partially offset by a $4.6 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest expense between the two periods reflected an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost. For the year ended June 30, 2017 the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $244.2 million to $3.22 billion compared to $2.97 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased six basis points to 1.13% from 1.07%.\nThe net interest rate spread increased eight basis points to 2.14% for fiscal 2017 from 2.06% for fiscal 2016 while the net interest margin increased six basis points to 2.41% from 2.35% for those same comparative periods.\nThe provision for loan losses decreased $5.3 million to $5.4 million for fiscal 2017 from $10.7 million for fiscal 2016. The decrease in provision expense partly reflected a net decrease in specific losses recognized on loans evaluated individually for impairment. This decrease was primarily reflected in the lower level of net charge offs recognized on such loans between comparative periods. The decrease in net charge offs also contributed to a decrease in the historical loss factors utilized to measure impairment on collectively evaluated loans. Taken together with the updates to environmental loss factors, the provision expense for loans collectively evaluated for impairment decreased year-over-year. To a lesser extent, the net decrease in the provision expense reflected slightly lower growth in the outstanding balance of loans collectively evaluated for impairment during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.\nNon-interest income increased $621,000 to $11.3 million for fiscal 2017 from $10.7 million for fiscal 2016. The increase was largely attributable to an increase in loan sale gains that partly reflected an increase in the volume of residential mortgage loans originated and sold as the Company continued to expand its mortgage banking business line throughout fiscal 2017. The increase in loan sale gains also reflected an increase in the volume of SBA loans originated and sold. The noted increase in non-interest income was partially offset by a decrease in income arising from our investment in bank-owned life insurance due largely to the lingering effects of lower market interest rates on the income earned on the cash surrender value of the various policies held by the Company. The increase in non-interest income was also partially offset by a decrease in fees and service charges that was largely attributable to a decrease in deposit-related service charges coupled with a lesser decrease in loan prepayment charges.\nNon-interest expense increased by $8.7 million to $81.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $72.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was reflected across most categories of non-interest expense with the most noteworthy increases reflected in salaries and employee benefits, director compensation and miscellaneous expenses.\nAs described in greater detail below, the increases in salaries and employee benefits and director compensation expense each reflected the impact of the Company's 2016 Equity Incentive Plan approved by shareholders in October 2016. The increase in salaries and employee benefits also reflected increases in employee compensation costs arising from an increase in the number of employees during the year as well as increases in health insurance and retirement-related employee benefit plans.\nIn addition to reflecting the noted impact of the costs associated with the Company's 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, the increase in director compensation expense also reflected an increase in director fees attributable to the addition of two independent directors during the prior fiscal year whose full-year\u201d annual compensation expense were fully reflected during fiscal 2017.\nWhile reflecting a variety of increases across a number of general and administrative expenses, the increase in miscellaneous expense for fiscal 2017 reflected the effect of the Company's recognition of a non-recurring recovery of director pension plan expense during the prior fiscal year.\nFinally, the noted increases in non-interest expense were partially offset by a decrease in deposit insurance expense that largely reflected a decrease in the assessment rate charged by the FDIC during fiscal 2017.\nThe combined effects of the factors highlighted above resulted in a $4.8 million increase in pre-tax net income and a corresponding $2.0 million increase in income tax expense during fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. We describe them in detail in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included as an exhibit to this document. In preparing the audited consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of financial condition and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the evaluation of securities impairment and the impairment testing of goodwill.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects our estimation of the losses in our loan portfolio to the extent they are both probable and reasonable to estimate. The balance of the allowance is generally maintained through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income in the period that estimated losses on loans are identified by our loan review system. We charge losses on loans against the allowance as such losses are actually incurred. Recoveries on loans previously charged-off are added back to the allowance.\nAs described in greater detail in the notes to audited consolidated financial statements, our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology utilizes a two-tier\u201d loss measurement process that is generally performed monthly. Through the first tier of the process, we identify the loans that must be reviewed individually for impairment. Such loans generally include our larger and/or more complex loans including commercial mortgage loans, comprising multi-family and nonresidential real estate loans, construction loans and commercial business loans as well as our one- to four-family mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. A reviewed loan is deemed to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Once a loan is determined to be impaired, management measures the amount of the estimated impairment associated with that loan which is generally defined as the amount by which the carrying value of a loan exceeds its fair value. We establish valuation allowances for loan impairments in the fiscal period during which they are identified. Impairments on individually evaluated loans generally are charged off against the applicable valuation allowance when they are determined to be confirmed, expected losses.\nThe second tier of the loss measurement process involves estimating the probable and estimable losses on loans not otherwise individually reviewed for impairment. Such loans generally comprise large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans as well as the remaining non-impaired loans of those types noted above that are otherwise eligible for individual impairment evaluation.\nValuation allowances established through the second tier of the loss measurement process utilize historical and environmental loss factors to collectively estimate the level of probable losses within defined segments of our loan portfolio. To calculate the historical loss factors, our allowance for loan loss methodology generally utilizes a two-year moving average of annualized net charge-off rates (charge-offs net of recoveries) by loan segment, where available, to calculate the actual, historical loss experience. The outstanding principal balance of each loan segment is multiplied by the applicable historical loss factor to estimate the level of probable losses based upon our historical loss experience.\nEnvironmental loss factors are based upon specific quantitative and qualitative criteria representing key sources of risk within the loan portfolio. Such sources of risk include those relating to the level of and trends in nonperforming loans; the level of and trends in credit risk management effectiveness, the levels and trends in lending resource capability; levels and trends in economic and market conditions; levels and trends in loan concentrations; levels and trends in loan composition and terms, levels and trends in independent loan review effectiveness, levels and trends in collateral values and the effects of other external factors. The outstanding principal balance of each loan segment is multiplied by the applicable environmental loss factors to estimate the level of probable losses based upon their supporting quantitative and qualitative criteria.\nThe sum of the probable and estimable loan losses calculated in accordance with loss measurement processes, as described above, represents the total targeted balance for our allowance for loan losses at the end of a fiscal period. A more detailed discussion of our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology is presented in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment Testing of Goodwill. We record goodwill, representing the excess of amounts paid over the fair value of net assets of the institutions acquired in purchase transactions, at its fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested and deemed impaired when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Goodwill was most recently tested as of June 30, 2017, at which\ntime no impairment was indicated. As of that date, we reported goodwill of $108.6 million. The value of the goodwill can change in the future. We expect the value of the goodwill to decrease if there is a significant decrease in the franchise value of Kearny Bank. If an impairment is determined in the future, we will reflect the loss as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined, leading to a reduction of our net income for that period by the amount of the impairment.\nOther-than-Temporary Impairment ( OTTI\u201d) of Securities. If the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost, the security is deemed to be impaired. Management evaluates all securities with unrealized losses quarterly to determine if such impairments are temporary\u201d or other-than-temporary\u201d in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.\nWe account for temporary impairments based upon the classification of the related security as either available for sale, held to maturity or trading. Temporary impairments on available for sale\u201d securities are recognized, on a tax-effected basis, through accumulated other comprehensive income with offsetting entries adjusting the carrying value of the security and the balance of deferred taxes. Conversely, we do not adjust the carrying value of held to maturity\u201d securities for temporary impairments, although information concerning the amount and duration of impairments on held to maturity securities is generally disclosed in periodic financial statements. The carrying value of securities held in a trading portfolio is adjusted to their fair value through earnings on a daily basis. However, we maintained no securities in trading portfolios at or during the periods presented in these financial statements.\nWe account for OTTI based upon several considerations. First, OTTI on securities that we have decided to sell as of the close of a fiscal period, or will, more likely than not, be required to sell prior to the full recovery of their fair value to a level equal to or exceeding their amortized cost, are recognized in earnings. If neither of these conditions regarding the likelihood of the security's sale is applicable, then the OTTI is bifurcated into credit-related and noncredit-related components. A credit-related impairment generally represents the amount by which the present value of the cash flows that are expected to be collected on an other-than-temporarily impaired security fall below its amortized cost. The noncredit-related component represents the remaining portion of the impairment not otherwise designated as credit-related. We recognize credit-related, OTTI in earnings. However, noncredit-related, other-than-temporary impairments on debt securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nComparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016\nGeneral. Total assets increased $318.1 million to $4.82 billion at June 30, 2017 from $4.50 billion at June 30, 2016. The net increase in total assets primarily reflected an increase in net loans receivable that was partially offset by decreases in balances of securities and cash and cash equivalents. The net increase in total assets was largely funded by increases in deposits and borrowings that were partially offset by a net decrease in stockholders' equity.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents, which consist primarily of interest-earning and non-interest-earning deposits in other banks, decreased by $121.0 million to $78.2 million at June 30, 2017 from $199.2 million at June 30, 2016. The balance of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 reflected the effects of temporary accumulation of short-term, liquid assets arising from an increase in loan prepayments during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The average balance of cash and equivalents decreased steadily in fiscal 2017 reflecting the Company's ongoing effort to enhance earnings by generally reducing the level of lower-yielding, short-term liquid assets to the amount needed to fund the Company's strategic initiatives while meeting its performance and risk management objectives.\nDebt Securities Available for Sale. Debt securities classified as available for sale increased by $54.6 million to $444.5 million at June 30, 2017 from $389.9 million at June 30, 2016. The net increase in the portfolio partly reflected security purchases totaling $138.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 coupled with a $10.8 million decrease in the net unrealized loss of the portfolio to a net unrealized loss of $1.4 million at June 30, 2017 from a net unrealized loss of $12.2 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease in the net unrealized loss reflected changes in the fair value of various sectors within the portfolio arising from movements in market interest rates coupled with a tightening of pricing spreads within certain sectors in the portfolio. The noted increases in the portfolio were partially offset by principal repayments, net of premium amortization and discount accretion, totaling $94.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nThe net unrealized loss on debt securities available for sale was primarily reflected within the applicable credit sectors\u201d of the portfolio which include asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, corporate bonds and non-pooled trust preferred securities. The net unrealized loss on this subset of securities decreased by $11.6 million to a net unrealized loss of $1.7 million at June 30, 2017 from a net unrealized loss of $13.3 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease in the unrealized loss largely reflected a general tightening of pricing spreads in the marketplace resulting in an overall increase in the market price of such securities. The decrease in the net unrealized loss on the noted securities was partially offset by a $755,000 decline in the fair value of government and agency securities, including U.S. agency debentures and municipal obligations, to an unrealized loss of $287,000 at June 30, 2017 from an unrealized gain of $1.0 million at June 30, 2016.\nBased on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of June 30, 2017. However, volatility in the financial markets may result in additional decreases in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities. Such volatility may impact the fair value of the securities within the credit sectors\u201d of the portfolio more adversely than the Company's government and agency securities. The adverse effects of such volatility on the current and prospective financial strength of specific corporate issuers, and the resulting impact on the fair value of the related securities held by the Company, will be carefully monitored by management.\nMortgage-backed Securities Available for Sale. Mortgage-backed securities available for sale decreased by $114.3 million to $169.3 million at June 30, 2017 from $283.6 million at June 30, 2016. The net decrease partly reflected security sales totaling $83.4 million coupled with cash repayment of principal, net of discount accretion and premium amortization, totaling $53.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2017 while also reflecting a $8.5 million decrease in the fair value of the portfolio to a net unrealized loss of $986,000 at June 30, 2017 from a net unrealized gain of $7.5 million at June 30, 2016. These decreases in the portfolio were partially offset by security purchases totaling $30.7 million during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nAt June 30, 2017, the available for sale mortgage-backed securities portfolio primarily included agency pass-through securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nAdditional information regarding securities available for sale at June 30, 2017 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 4 and Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nDebt Securities Held to Maturity. Debt securities classified as held to maturity decreased by $22.5 million to $144.7 million at June 30, 2017 from $167.2 million at June 30, 2016. The net decrease in the portfolio largely reflected principal repayments, net of premium amortization and discount accretion, totaling $56.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2017. The net decrease was partially offset by debt security purchases totaling $34.4 million during the same period. Such purchases included the purchase of $15.0 million in subordinated debt issued by a New Jersey-based community bank through a privately negotiated transaction during the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nAt June 30, 2017, the held to maturity debt securities portfolio also included U.S. agency debentures and municipal obligations, a small portion of which represent non-rated, short term, bond anticipation notes ( BANs\u201d) issued by New Jersey municipalities. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nMortgage-backed Securities Held to Maturity. Mortgage-backed securities held to maturity decreased by $61.5 million to $348.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $410.1 million at June 30, 2016. The net decrease in the portfolio partly reflected security sales totaling $5.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2017, coupled with cash repayment of principal, net of discount accretion and premium amortization, totaling $56.4 million. The securities sold were limited to those whose remaining outstanding balances had declined to the required thresholds, in relation to the original amount purchased or acquired, that allowed their sale from the held to maturity portfolio.\nAt June 30, 2017, the held to maturity mortgage-backed securities portfolio primarily included agency pass-through securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations. As of that date, we also held three non-agency mortgage-backed securities in the held to maturity portfolio whose aggregate carrying values and fair values both totaled $22,000. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nAdditional information regarding securities available for sale at June 30, 2017 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 4 and Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nLoans Held-for-Sale. The Company continues to expand its residential lending infrastructure to support strategies focused on increasing the origination volume of residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. The increase in residential mortgage loan origination and sale activity has increased the Company's level of non-interest income through the recognition of additional sources of recurring loan sale gains while serving to help manage the Company's exposure to interest rate risk. During the year ended June 30, 2017, we sold $84.4 million of residential mortgage loans resulting in net sale gains totaling $713,000 for fiscal 2017. Loans held for sale totaled $4.7 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $3.3 million at June 30, 2016 and are reported separately from the balance of net loans receivable as of those dates.\nLoans Receivable. Loans receivable, net of unamortized premiums, deferred costs and the allowance for loan losses, increased by $566.2 million, or 21.4%, to $3.22 billion at June 30, 2017 from $2.65 billion at June 30, 2016. The increase in net loans receivable\nwas primarily attributable to new loan origination and purchase volume outpacing loan repayments during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nResidential mortgage loans held in portfolio, including home equity loans and lines of credit, decreased by $44.7 million to $650.1 million at June 30, 2017 from $694.8 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the balance of one- to four-family first mortgage loans of $37.9 million to $567.3 million at June 30, 2017 from $605.2 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease also reflected an aggregate decrease of $6.8 million in the balance of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit to $82.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $89.6 million at June 30, 2016.\nNotwithstanding the decrease in their balance during the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company may modestly increase the outstanding balance of residential mortgage loans held in portfolio in the future while allowing the segment to continue to decline as a percentage of total loans and earning assets. In total, the origination volume of portfolio residential mortgage loans for the year ended June 30, 2017 totaled $67.9 million while aggregate originations of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit totaled $18.5 million for that same period.\nCommercial loans, in aggregate, increased by $622.9 million to $2.57 billion at June 30, 2017 from $1.95 billion at June 30, 2016. The components of the aggregate increase included an increase in commercial mortgage loans totaling $636.7 million that was partially offset by a $13.7 million decrease in commercial business loans. The ending balances of commercial mortgage loans and commercial business loans at June 30, 2017 were $2.50 billion and $74.5 million, respectively.\nCommercial loan origination volume for the year ended June 30, 2017 totaled $761.5 million, comprised of $727.4 million and $34.1 million of commercial mortgage and commercial business loan originations, respectively. Commercial loan originations were augmented with the purchase of commercial mortgage loans and participations totaling $126.7 million coupled with the purchase of commercial business loans totaling $17.0 million during the year ended June 30, 2017. Commercial mortgage loan purchases were funded during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with the excess liquidity that had accumulated during the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe outstanding balance of construction loans, net of loans-in-process, increased by $1.8 million to $3.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $2.0 million at June 30, 2016. Construction loan disbursements for the year ended June 30, 2017 totaled $3.0 million.\nOther loans, primarily account loans, deposit account overdraft lines of credit and other consumer loans, decreased by $9.0 million to $16.4 million at June 30, 2017 from $25.4 million at June 30, 2016. The balance of other consumer loans at June 30, 2017 included loans with outstanding balances totaling $12.8 million that were acquired through the Company's relationship with Lending Club, an established peer-to-peer (i.e. marketplace) lender. Through this relationship, the Company has purchased high-quality, unsecured consumer loans originated through Lending Club's online platform. The Company limited its original investment in the Lending Club loan portfolio to an initial threshold of approximately $25.0 million in aggregate outstanding balances and continues to independently monitor and validate the performance of the portfolio in relation to Company's expectations as well as those of Lending Club's proprietary credit risk model. Additional investment in Lending Club loans up to this initial threshold may be considered by the Company while it continues to monitor and assess the performance of the portfolio and quality of loan servicing and reporting rendered by Lending Club.\nThe Company originated $1.8 million of consumer loans during the year ended June 30, 2017 while no additional consumer loans were purchased during the period.\nNonperforming Loans. Nonperforming loans decreased by $2.2 million to $18.9 million, or 0.58% of total loans at June 30, 2017, from $21.1 million, or 0.79% of total loans at June 30, 2016. Nonperforming loans generally include loans reported as accruing loans over 90 days past due\u201d and loans reported as nonaccrual\u201d with such balances totaling $74,000 and $18.8 million, respectively, at June 30, 2017.\nAdditional information about the Company's nonperforming loans at June 30, 2017 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. During the year ended June 30, 2017, the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased by $5.1 million to $29.3 million or 0.90% of total loans at June 30, 2017 from $24.2 million or 0.91% of total loans at June 30, 2016. The increase resulted from provisions of $5.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2017 that were partially offset by charge-offs, net of recoveries, totaling $324,000 during that same period.\nAdditional information about the allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2017 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K as well as in Note 1 and Note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nOther Assets. The aggregate balance of other assets, including premises and equipment, FHLB stock, interest receivable, goodwill, bank owned life insurance, deferred income taxes and other miscellaneous assets, increased by $15.1 million to $412.1 million at June 30, 2017 from $397.0 million at June 30, 2016.\nThe increase in other assets partly reflected an increase in the fair value of the Company's interest rate derivatives portfolio to a net asset value of $7.8 million, included in other assets at June 30, 2017, compared to a net liability value of $19.3 million, included in other liabilities at June 30, 2016. The increase in other assets also included a $9.3 million increase in FHLB stock resulting from an increase in short-term advances drawn during the year ended June 30, 2017 coupled with a $5.2 million increase in the cash surrender value of the Company's bank-owned life insurance policies for the same period. The noted increases in other assets were partially offset by a $10.5 million decrease in deferred income tax assets arising primarily from changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities and derivatives portfolios.\nThe noted increases in other assets included a $806,000 increase in the balance of real estate owned ( REO\u201d) to $1.6 million representing the carrying value of four properties at June 30, 2017, from $826,000, representing the carrying value of three properties at June 30, 2016.\nThe remaining increases and decreases in other assets for the year ended June 30, 2017 generally comprised normal operating fluctuations in their respective balances.\nDeposits. Total deposits increased by $235.3 million to $2.93 billion at June 30, 2017 from $2.69 billion at June 30, 2016. The increase in deposit balances reflected a $206.6 million increase in interest-bearing deposits coupled with a $28.7 million increase in non-interest-bearing deposits. The increase in interest-bearing deposits included an increase in the balance of interest-bearing checking accounts totaling $115.0 million as well as increases in balances of certificates of deposit and savings and club accounts totaling $83.6 million and $8.0 million, respectively.\nThe noted increase in non-interest-bearing deposits partly reflected fluctuating balances within certain large commercial deposit accounts. Notwithstanding these day-to-day fluctuations, the average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits has increased by $24.3 million to $249.7 million compared to $225.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe change in deposit balances for the period reflected changes in the balances of retail deposits as well as non-retail\u201d deposits acquired through various wholesale channels. The $115.0 million increase in the balance of interest-bearing checking accounts primarily reflected an increase in the balance of retail accounts while the balance of brokered money market deposits acquired through Promontory IND program totaled $222.6 million, or 7.6% of total deposits at June 30, 2017, compared to $224.1 million, or 8.3% of total deposits at June 30, 2016. The terms of the IND program generally establish a reciprocal commitment for Promontory to deliver and for us to accept such deposits for a period of no less than five years during which time total aggregate balances shall be maintained within a range of $200.0 million to $230.0 million. Such deposits are generally sourced by Promontory from large retail and institutional brokerage firms whose individual clients seek to have a portion of their investments held in interest-bearing accounts at FDIC-insured institutions.\nWe continued to utilize a deposit listing service through which we attract non-brokered\u201d wholesale time deposits targeting institutional investors with an original investment horizon of two-to-five years. We generally prohibit the withdrawal of our listing service deposits prior to maturity. The balance of the Bank's listing service time deposits increased to $101.4 million, or 3.5% of total deposits at June 30, 2017, compared to $89.9 million, or 3.3% of total deposits at June 30, 2016.\nWe also maintain a small portfolio of longer-term, brokered certificates of deposit whose balances increased by approximately $13.2 million to $21.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $8.4 million at June 30, 2016. In combination with our Promontory IND money market deposits, our brokered deposits totaled $244.2 million, or 8.3% of deposits at June 30, 2017 compared to $232.5 million, or 8.6% of deposits at June 30, 2016.\nBorrowings. The balance of borrowings increased by $191.8 million to $806.2 million at June 30, 2017 from $614.4 million at June 30, 2016. The increase in borrowings primarily reflected an additional $200.0 million of short-term FHLB advances drawn to fund a portion of our growth in loans during fiscal 2017. We utilized interest rate derivatives to effectively swap the rolling 90-day maturity/repricing characteristics of these new borrowings into fixed rates for longer terms. Of the $200.0 million of new advances, $150.0 million were swapped to fixed rate for four years while the remaining $50.0 million were swapped to a fixed rate for five years.\nThe increase in short-term FHLB advances was partially offset by the repayment of a $3.0 million FHLB term advance that matured during the period coupled with principal payments that reduced the outstanding balance of one amortizing advance. Additionally, the net change in borrowings reflected a $5.1 million decrease in outstanding overnight sweep account\u201d balances linked\nto customer demand deposits that generally reflected internal transfers to interest-bearing checking accounts as well as normal operating fluctuations in such balances.\nOther Liabilities. The balance of other liabilities, including advance payments by borrowers for taxes and other miscellaneous liabilities, decreased by $18.6 million to $24.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $43.2 million at June 30, 2016. As noted earlier, the decrease primarily reflected changes in the fair value of the Company's derivatives coupled with normal operating fluctuations in the balances of other liabilities.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company executed a total of seven interest rate derivative transactions with an aggregate notional value of $640.0 million. Five of the transactions, totaling $440.0 million, represent interest rate swaps with a forward\u201d effective date that corresponds to the expiration date of one or more existing derivatives with the same aggregate notional value. As such, each of these five new derivatives effectively extends the interest rate risk protection provided by one or more existing derivatives that currently serve as cash flow hedges against existing sources of wholesale funding. The remaining two derivative transactions were those extending the effective duration of the new advances drawn during the year ended June 30, 2017, as discussed above.\nStockholders' Equity. Stockholders' equity decreased by $90.4 million to $1.06 billion at June 30, 2017 from $1.15 billion at June 30, 2016. The decrease in stockholders' equity largely reflected the impact of the Company's share repurchases during fiscal 2017. In May 2017, the Company announced the completion of its first share repurchase program, originally announced in May 2016, through which it repurchased a total of 9,352,809 shares, or 10%, of its outstanding shares at a total cost of $130.6 million and an average cost of $13.96 per share. Concurrently, the Company announced its second share repurchase program through which it intends to repurchase a total of 8,559,084 shares, or 10%, of its outstanding shares. Through June 30, 2017, the Company has repurchased 1,240,000 shares, or 14.5% of the shares to be repurchased under its second share repurchase plan, at a total cost of $17.7 million and at an average cost of $14.30 per share. Cumulatively for the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company repurchased a total of 8,886,627 shares, at a total cost of $126.0 million, or an average cost of 14.18 per share. The cumulative cost of the Company's repurchased shares has directly reduced the balance of stockholders' equity at June 30, 2017.\nThe net decrease in stockholders' equity was partially offset by net income of $18.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from which cash dividends of $8.4 million were declared and payable to shareholders during the period. The change in stockholders' equity also reflected a $17.8 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, due primarily to changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities portfolio and outstanding derivatives, and a $1.9 million reduction of unearned ESOP shares for plan shares earned by plan participants during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nAt June 30, 2017, the Company had 84,350,848 shares outstanding, comprising 93,528,092 shares originally issued, plus 1,415,565 net shares issued and cancelled relating to stock benefit plan obligations less 10,592,809 cumulative shares repurchased and cancelled through that date.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended June 30, 2017 was $18.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share, an increase of $2.8 million from $15.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in net income reflected increases in net interest income and non-interest income coupled with a decrease in the provision for loan losses that were partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense. These factors contributed to an overall increase in pre-tax net income and a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2017 was $102.6 million; an increase of $7.6 million from $95.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in net interest income between the comparative periods resulted from an increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets coupled with an increase in their average yield. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost.\nAs a result of these factors, our net interest rate spread increased eight basis points to 2.14% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 2.06% for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in the net interest rate spread reflected a 14 basis points increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets to 3.27% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 3.13% for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by six basis points to 1.13% from 1.07%. A discussion of the factors contributing to changes in the average yield and average cost of categories within interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, is presented in the separate discussion and analysis of interest income and interest expense below.\nThe factors resulting in the reported increase in our net interest rate spread also affected our net interest margin. In total, the Company's net interest margin increased six basis points to 2.41% for the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to 2.35% for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $12.2 million to $139.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $126.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. As noted above, the increase in interest income partly reflected a $200.6 million increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $4.25 billion for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $4.05 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the yield on earning assets increased by 14 basis points to 3.27% from 3.13%.\nInterest income from loans increased $13.2 million to $111.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $98.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in interest income on loans was attributable to a net increase in the average balance of loans that was partially offset by a decline in their average yield.\nThe average balance of loans increased by $443.5 million to $2.96 billion for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $2.51 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. The reported increase in the average balance of loans primarily reflected an aggregate increase of $483.7 million in the average balance of commercial loans to $2.27 billion for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $1.78 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average balance of other loans, primarily comprising unsecured consumer term loans, account loans and deposit account overdraft lines of credit, increased by $5.1 million to $20.6 million from $15.5 million. The increase in the average balance of other loans primarily reflected the increased balance of unsecured consumer term loans acquired through Lending Club, as described earlier.\nThe increase in the average balance of commercial and consumer loans was partially offset by a $43.3 million decrease in the average balance of residential mortgage loans to $663.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $706.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of construction loans decreased by $2.6 million to $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $4.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe effect on interest income attributable to the net increase in the average balance of loans was partially offset by the noted decrease in their average yield. The average yield on loans decreased by 14 basis points to 3.76% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 3.90% for the year ended June 30, 2016. The reduction in the overall yield on our loan portfolio largely reflected the effect of the comparatively lower average yield on most newly originated loans in relation to that of the portfolio of existing loans which has reduced the overall yield of the aggregate portfolio. To a lesser extent, the decline in the average yield generally reflects the effects of low market interest rates that provide rate reduction\u201d refinancing incentive to existing borrowers while also contributing to the downward re-pricing of adjustable rate loans.\nInterest income from mortgage-backed securities decreased by $3.3 million to $14.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $17.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in interest income reflected a decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities coupled with a decrease in their average yield.\nThe average balance of mortgage-backed securities decreased by $119.5 million to $621.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $741.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities largely reflected the level of aggregate principal repayments and security sales between comparative periods outpacing aggregate security purchases.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average yield on mortgage-backed securities decreased by eight basis points to 2.25% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 2.33% for the year ended June 30, 2016. The reduction in the overall yield on mortgage-backed securities largely reflected the effect of the comparatively lower average yield on purchased securities in relation to that of the existing portfolio coupled with the continuing repayment of comparatively higher yielding securities within the portfolio.\nInterest income from debt securities increased by $1.9 million to $11.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $9.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in interest income reflected an increase in the average yield on debt securities that was partially offset by a decrease in their average balance. The average yield on debt securities increased 47 basis points to 2.12% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 1.65% for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in yield was largely attributable to floating rate securities whose interest rates have increased due to recent increases in short-term market interest rates. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of debt securities decreased $43.0 million to $559.4 million from $602.4 million.\nThe increase in the average yield on debt securities reflected a 57 basis points increase in the yield on taxable securities to 2.14% during the year ended June 30, 2017 from 1.57% during the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the yield on tax-exempt securities increased two basis points to 2.01% from 1.99%.\nThe decrease in the average balance of debt securities was largely attributable to a $47.5 million decrease in the average balance of taxable securities to $444.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $492.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in taxable securities was partially offset by a $4.5 million increase in the average balance of tax-exempt securities to $114.5 million from $110.0 million.\nInterest income from other interest-earning assets increased by $298,000 to $2.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 reflecting an increase in their average yield that was partially offset by a decrease in their average balance. The average yield on other interest-earning assets increased by 90 basis points to 1.81% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 0.91% for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of other interest-earning assets decreased by $80.3 million to $114.1 million from $194.5 million. The increase in average yield and decrease in the average balance of other interest earning assets largely reflected the Company's efforts to reduce the opportunity cost of maintaining excess liquidity by reinvesting a portion of cash and cash equivalents into the loan portfolio during the current fiscal year.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased by $4.6 million to $36.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $31.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. As noted earlier, the increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $244.2 million to $3.22 billion for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $2.97 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased six basis points to 1.13% from 1.07%.\nInterest expense attributed to deposits increased by $3.4 million to $22.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $18.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in interest expense was attributable to increases in the average cost and average balance of interest-bearing deposits.\nThe average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased by eight basis points to 0.87% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 0.79% for the year ended June 30, 2016. The net increase in the average cost largely reflected an increase in the average cost of certificates of deposit, which increased 10 basis points to 1.32% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 1.22% for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing checking accounts increased seven basis points to 0.66% from 0.59% while the average cost of savings and club accounts decreased three basis points to 0.13% from 0.16%.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by $175.9 million to $2.53 billion for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $2.36 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in the average balance was reflected across all categories of interest-bearing deposits. For the comparative periods noted, the average balance of certificates of deposit increased by $126.0 million to $1.24 billion from $1.12 billion, the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts increased by $46.8 million to $769.9 million from $723.1 million and the average balance of savings and club accounts increased by $3.1 million to $519.5 million from $516.4 million.\nInterest expense attributed to borrowings increased by $1.2 million to $14.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $13.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in interest expense on borrowings reflected an increase in their average balance that was partially offset by a decrease in their average cost. The average balance of borrowings increased by $68.3 million to $685.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $617.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of borrowings decreased four basis points to 2.10% from 2.14%.\nThe increase in the average balance of borrowings largely reflected a $65.2 million increase in the average balance of FHLB advances to $647.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $582.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of FHLB advances decreased three basis points to 2.21% from 2.24% largely reflecting the Company's greater use of lower-costing, overnight borrowings to temporarily fund a portion of loan growth during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nThe noted increase in the average balance of borrowings also reflected a $3.0 million increase in the average balance of other borrowings, comprised primarily of depositor sweep accounts, to $38.4 million from $35.4 million. The average cost of sweep accounts decreased by 18 basis points to 0.33% from 0.51% between the same comparative periods.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses decreased by $5.3 million to $5.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $10.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was largely attributable to a lower provision on non-impaired\nloans evaluated collectively for impairment coupled with a decrease in specific losses recognized on nonperforming loans individually reviewed for impairment.\nRegarding the provision on non-impaired loans, the noted decrease largely reflected the comparative effects of updates to historical and environmental loss factors between periods. As previously discussed, the changes to historical loss factors generally reflected the impact of a decreased level of net charge offs recognized during the year ended June 30, 2017 on the two-year lookback period used to calculate the Company's historical loss factors coupled with the roll off\u201d of the net charge offs from the same period two years earlier. The Company also updated certain environmental loss factors during the year ended June 30, 2017. Such updates primarily reflected an increase in the level of estimated credit losses attributable to the increased concentration and decreased seasoning in the Company's commercial mortgage loan sectors. To a lesser extent, the net decrease in the provision expense reflected slightly lower growth in the outstanding balance of loans collectively evaluated for impairment during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.\nThe prior discussion regarding the allowance for loan losses also highlighted the impact of the re-segmentation\u201d of the loan portfolio on the Company's environmental loss factors. As noted therein, such loss factors were re-evaluated and re-allocated, where appropriate, to reflect the more granular segmentation of loans in the allowance for loan loss calculation during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Where appropriate, the specific criteria and/or basis upon which the Company derives the environmental loss factors ascribed to loans was also revised or enhanced in conjunction with the segmentation changes noted.\nThe implementation of the segmentation changes within the loan portfolio in the calculation of the allowance for loan loss did not result in a significant change in the required, aggregate balance of the allowance attributable to loans evaluated collectively for impairment. Consequently, the decrease in the provision for loan losses during the year ended June 30, 2017 largely reflected the updates to the historical and environmental loss factors discussed earlier coupled with the lesser effect of a comparatively lower level of growth in the unimpaired portion of the loan portfolio between comparative periods. As noted above, the decrease in provision also reflected a decrease in losses recognized on specific loans individually reviewed for impairment.\nAdditional information regarding the allowance for loan losses and the associated provisions recognized during the year ended June 30, 2017 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 1 and Note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income, excluding gains and losses on the sale securities and gains and losses on the sale and write-down real estate owned, increased by $593,000 to $11.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $10.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was largely attributable to a $1.1 million increase in the gain on sale of loans. The increase in loan sale gains included a $468,000 increase in gains associated with the sale of SBA loans arising from an increase in loans originated and sold. The increase in loan sale gains also included $631,000 in gains on sale of residential mortgage loans reflecting the continued expansion of the Company's mortgage banking business strategy.\nThe noted increases in non-interest income were partially offset by a $356,000 decrease in the income recognized on bank-owned life insurance that largely reflected the continuing effects of lower market interest rates on the yields earned by the Company on its underlying policies. A decrease in fees and service charges also offset a portion of the overall increase in non-interest income. A significant portion of the decrease in fees and service charges reflected a reduction in deposit-related merchant processing fees that was fully offset by a corresponding decrease in merchant processing service provider expenses that partially offset the increase in non-interest expense within the category of equipment and systems expenses. To a lesser extent, the decrease in fees and service charges also reflected decreases in other deposit-related fees and charges, including account overdraft and electronic banking fees and charges, as well as a reduction in loan-related prepayment charges.\nWe also recognized net losses totaling $106,000 arising from the write down and sale of REO during the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to net losses of $137,000 recognized during the earlier comparative period. The decrease in losses relating to the disposal of real estate owned were partially offset by a nominal decrease in gains and losses arising from the sale and call of securities.\nNon-Interest Expenses. Non-interest expense increased by $8.7 million to $81.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $72.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The net increase in non-interest expense primarily reflected increases in salary and employee benefits expense, director compensation expense and miscellaneous expense with lesser increases reflected in premises occupancy expense, equipment and system expense and advertising and market expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in deposit insurance expense.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased by $5.7 million to $47.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $42.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increases in salaries and employee benefits partly reflected the impact of the Company's 2016 Equity Incentive Plan approved by shareholders in October 2016. Based on the original value of the grants at the time they were issued on December 1, 2016, coupled with the five year vesting period, the aggregate pre-tax\u201d and after-tax\u201d expense\nassociated with the noted grants total approximately $6.2 million and $4.3 million per year, respectively, of which approximately $3.6 million and $2.5 million were recognized during the latter seven months of fiscal 2017, respectively. Approximately $2.5 million of such pre-tax\u201d expenses were allocated and reported in salaries and employee benefits with the remaining $1.1 million included in director compensation, as discussed below.\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits also reflected increases in employee compensation costs arising from an incremental increase in the number of FTE employees during the year as well as overall increases in employee health insurance costs. Additionally, retirement plan-related expenses increased due to an increase in the Company's contribution to its employee defined-benefit pension plan as well as an increase in ESOP expense attributable to the increase in the average market price of the Company's shares of capital stock during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.\nThe $1.2 million increase in director compensation expense for fiscal 2017 primarily reflected $1.1 million in allocated expenses attributable to director benefits associated with the Company's 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, as noted above. The remaining portion of the variance reflected an increase in director fees that was primarily attributable to the addition of two independent directors during the prior fiscal year whose full-year\u201d annual compensation expense were fully reflected during fiscal 2017.\nWhile reflecting a variety of increases across a number of general and administrative expenses, the $1.4 million increase in miscellaneous expense for fiscal 2017 largely reflected the noteworthy effect of the Company's recognition of a $931,000 non-recurring recovery of pension plan expense during the prior fiscal year that resulted from amending the terms of its Director Consultation and Retirement Plan (the DCRP ).\nThe increase in premises occupancy expense partly reflected an increase in facility rent expense due to the revised terms of certain facility leases renewed during the period coupled with the additional cost of a new ground lease associated with a forthcoming branch relocation. The increase in premises occupancy expense also reflected an increase in facility repairs and maintenance expenses and real estate tax expenses relating to the Company's branch and administrative facilities.\nThe increase in equipment and systems expense largely reflected the recognition of a non-recurring recovery of certain historical data network charges that reduced technology service provider expenses during the prior fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe increase in advertising and marketing expense were primarily attributable to increased print, electronic media and outdoor advertising costs associated with specific campaigns supporting targeted business strategies focused on expansion of commercial business banking and consumer deposit products, services and relationships.\nFinally, the decrease in deposit insurance expense primarily reflected a reduction in the Bank's FDIC assessment rate that went into effect on July 1, 2016.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by $2.0 million to $8.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $6.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in income tax expense primarily reflected the underlying differences in the level of the taxable portion of pre-tax income between comparative periods.\nOur effective tax rates during the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 were 32.2% and 30.0% which, in relation to statutory income tax rates, reflected the effects of recurring sources of tax-favored income included in pre-tax income as well as the effects of non-recurring tax deductions recognized on the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options by employees.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $15.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share, an increase of $10.2 million compared to $5.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net income was partly attributable to the effect of the non-recurring $10.0 million charitable contribution that was made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering in fiscal 2015. The increase in net income also reflected increases in net interest income and non-interest income that were partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in non-interest expense, excluding the effects of the charitable contribution noted earlier. In total, these factors resulted in an increase in pre-tax net income between comparative periods. The Company recorded income tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2016. However, the effects of the Company's tax-favored income sources, coupled with other reductions in income tax expense, resulted in the Company recording a net income tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2015.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $95.0 million, an increase of $14.4 million from $80.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income between the comparative periods resulted from an increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase in interest expense. As discussed in greater detail below, the\nincrease in interest income was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets augmented by an increase in their average yield. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost. The average yields and average costs between comparative periods continued to reflect the effects of low interest rates that were prevalent in the marketplace throughout most of fiscal 2016.\nAs a result of these factors, our net interest rate spread decreased 14 basis points to 2.06% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.20% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the net interest rate spread reflected a 19 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 1.07% from 0.88% while the yield on earning assets increased by five basis points to 3.13% from 3.08% between those same comparative periods. A discussion of the factors contributing to the overall change in yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities is presented in the separate discussion and analysis of interest income and interest expense below.\nThe factors resulting in the decrease in net interest rate spread also adversely affected our net interest margin. However, the effects of those factors were more than offset by the beneficial impact to net interest income arising from the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets that was attributable to the investment of the net capital proceeds raised in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second step conversion and stock offering in May 2015. Consequently, the Company's net interest margin increased by one basis point to 2.35% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.34% for the year ended June 30, 2015.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $20.8 million to $126.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $106.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. As noted above, the increase in interest income reflected increases in both the average balance and average yield of interest-earning assets. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased by $603.4 million to $4.05 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $3.45 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average yield on interest-earning assets declined five basis points to 3.13% from 3.08%.\nInterest income from loans increased $21.3 million to $98.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $76.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest income on loans was attributable to a net increase in the average balance of loans that was partially offset by a decline in their average yield.\nThe average balance of loans increased by $662.5 million to $2.51 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.85 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. The reported increase in the average balance of loans primarily reflected an aggregate increase of $607.5 million in the average balance of commercial loans to $1.78 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.18 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. Our commercial loans generally comprise commercial mortgage loans, including multi-family and nonresidential mortgage loans, as well as secured and unsecured commercial business loans. The increase in the average balance of commercial loans included the effects of loan purchases funded with a portion of the proceeds raised in the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that closed in May 2015.\nThe increase in the average balance of total loans also reflected a net increase in the average balance of residential mortgage loans which increased by $43.5 million to $706.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $662.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. Our residential mortgages generally comprise one-to four-family first mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average balance of construction loans decreased $2.8 million to $4.2 million from $7.0 million while the average balance of consumer loans increased $10.8 million to $15.5 million from $4.7 million. The increase in the average balance of consumer loans for fiscal 2016 primarily reflected the effects of the loans acquired through the Company's relationship with Lending Club.\nThe effect on interest income attributable to the net increase in the average balance of loans was partially offset by the noted decrease in their average yield. The average yield on loans decreased by 24 basis points to 3.90% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 4.14% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The reduction in the overall yield on our loan portfolio largely reflects the continuing effect of low market interest rates. Specifically, the average yield on the newly originated loans that provided the incremental growth in the portfolio during fiscal 2016 reflected the generally low level of interest rates prevalent in the marketplace during the period which reduced the overall yield of the loan portfolio.\nInterest income from mortgage-backed securities decreased by $1.3 million to $17.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $18.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in interest income reflected a decrease in the average yield of mortgage-backed securities that was partially offset by an increase in their average balance.\nThe average yield on mortgage-backed securities decreased by 32 basis points to 2.33% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.65% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the overall yield of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio largely reflected the comparatively lower yields of securities purchased during fiscal 2016.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average balance of mortgage-backed securities increased by $37.6 million to $741.2 million from $703.6 million. The increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities largely reflects the effects of security purchases that outpaced principal repayments between comparative periods. The increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities included the effects of security purchases funded with a portion of the proceeds raised in the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that closed in May 2015.\nInterest income from debt securities increased by $717,000 to $9.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $9.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest income reflected an increase in the average yield on debt securities that was partially offset by a decrease in their average balance. The average yield on debt securities increased 21 basis points to 1.65% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.44 % for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of debt securities decreased $34.8 million to $602.4 million from $637.2 million.\nThe increase in the average yield on debt securities reflected a 22 basis point increase in the yield on taxable securities to 1.57% during the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.35% during the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the yield on tax-exempt securities increased four basis points to 1.99% from 1.95%.\nThe decrease in the average balance of debt securities was largely attributable to a $43.5 million decrease in the average balance of taxable securities to $492.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $535.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of tax-exempt securities increased by $8.7 million to $110.0 million from $101.3 million.\nInterest income from other interest-earning assets increased by $173,000 to $1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 reflecting an increase in the average yield that was partially offset by a decline in the average balance. The average yield on other interest-earning assets increased by 29 basis points to 0.91% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 0.62% for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of other interest-earning assets decreased by $61.7 million to $194.5 million from $256.2 million.\nThe changes in the average balance and average yield on other interest-earning assets between comparative periods largely reflected the effects of a temporary increase in low-yielding cash and cash equivalents held during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in these short-term liquid assets during that quarter largely reflected the funds received and held during the subscription phase of our second-step conversion and stock offering as well as the excess liquidity held after the closing of the transaction pending their investment into other higher yielding assets during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased by $6.5 million to $31.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $25.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities as well as an increase in their average cost. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $78.5 million to $2.97 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $2.90 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 19 basis points to 1.07% from 0.88%.\nInterest expense attributed to deposits increased by $2.8 million to $18.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $15.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits coupled with an increase in their average cost.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by $18.2 million to $2.36 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $2.34 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For the comparative periods noted, the average balance of certificates of deposit increased by $91.4 million to $1.12 billion from $1.03 billion, while the average balance of savings and club accounts increased $566,000 to $516.4 million from $515.8 million. These increases were partially offset by a $73.8 million decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts to $723.1 million from $797.0 million.\nThe cost of interest-bearing deposits increased by 11 basis points to 0.79% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 0.68% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The net increase in the average cost was partly attributable to a 13 basis points increase in the average cost of certificates of deposit which increased to 1.22% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.09% for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing checking accounts increased nine basis points to 0.59% from 0.50%, while the average cost of savings and club accounts remained stable at 0.16% between those same comparative periods.\nThe decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts and the corresponding increase in their average cost largely reflected the effects of the low-cost funds held in such accounts during the subscription phase of our second step conversion and stock offering in fiscal 2015. Conversely, the increase in the average balance and average cost of certificates of deposits largely reflected the effects of attracting higher-cost, longer-term funding through our retail deposit channels for interest rate risk management purposes.\nInterest expense attributed to borrowings increased by $3.7 million to $13.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $9.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense on borrowings reflected increases in their average balance and average cost. The average balance of borrowings increased by $60.3 million to $617.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $557.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of borrowings increased 44 basis points to 2.14% from 1.70%.\nThe net increase in the average balance of borrowings largely reflected a $55.6 million increase in the average balance of FHLB advances which increased to $582.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $526.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of FHLB advances increased 47 basis points to 2.24% from 1.77%. As noted earlier, the increase in the average balance of FHLB advances primarily reflected an additional short-term advance of $50.0 million drawn during the year ended June 30, 2016 whose cost had been effectively fixed over a five-year period based on a previously executed interest rate swap transaction whose terms became effective during the period.\nThe net increase in the average balance of borrowings also reflected a $4.7 million increase in the average balance of other borrowings, comprised primarily of depositor sweep accounts, to $35.4 million from $30.7 million. The average cost of sweep accounts increased one basis point to 0.51% from 0.50% between comparative periods.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses increased $4.6 million to $10.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $6.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The net increase in the provision primarily reflected updates to historical and environmental loss factors utilized to measure impairment on collectively evaluated loans. The increase in provision expense also reflected the greater growth in such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in provision expense attributable to these factors was partially offset by a net decrease in specific losses recognized on loans evaluated individually for impairment that largely reflected a higher level of recoveries recognized on such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nAdditional information regarding the allowance for loan losses and the associated provisions recognized during the year ended June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 1 and Note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income, excluding gains and losses on the sale of securities and REO, increased by $2.2 million to $10.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $8.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase was partly attributable to an increase in the income arising from our investment in bank-owned life insurance due largely to the growth in the average balance of the cash surrender value of the various policies held by the Company. The Company had also recognized payouts on life insurance policies totaling $1.4 million during the prior year ended June 30, 2015 for which no such payouts were recognized during the year ended June 30, 2016. Absent the effect of these payouts, income from bank owned life insurance increased by approximately $3.0 million reflecting the noted increase in the average balance of the policies less the effects of a decrease in the earnings rate on such policies attributable to the sustained effects of lower long-term market interest rates.\nThe increase in non-interest income also reflected a net increase in fees and service charges that was primarily attributable to an increase in loan prepayment charges. The increase in loan prepayment charges were augmented, to a lesser degree, by a net increase in deposit-related fees and service charges, including ATM and debit card transaction fees separately reported under electronic banking fees and charges.\nThe increase in non-interest income reflected an increase in loan sale gains attributable to a $243,000 increase in SBA loan sale gains reflecting an overall increase in related loan origination and sale activity. The increase in loan sale gains also reflected $82,000 in gains on sale of residential mortgage loans arising from the initial implementation of the Company's mortgage banking business strategy during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nThe noted increases in non-interest income were partially offset by a decrease in miscellaneous income that primarily reflected the recognition of a $370,000 non-recurring adjustment to gain on bargain purchase during the year ended June 30, 2015 relating to the Company's prior acquisition of Atlas Bank.\nThe noted net increase in non-interest income was augmented by a decrease in net losses relating to write downs and sales of real estate owned between comparative periods. The decrease in losses relating to the disposal of real estate owned were partially offset by a nominal decrease in gains arising from the sale and call of securities.\nNon-Interest Expenses. Non-interest expense decreased by $5.7 million to $72.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $78.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. However, non-interest expense for fiscal 2015 included a non-recurring $10.0 million charitable contribution that was made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering. Excluding the effect of that charitable contribution, included in miscellaneous expense during the prior fiscal year, non-interest expense increased by $4.3 million during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nThe increase in non-interest expense, as adjusted, reflected increases in salaries and employee benefits, advertising and marketing, deposit insurance and director compensation expenses that were partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous expense coupled with less noteworthy decreases in premises occupancy expense and equipment and systems expense that generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those categories.\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits expense partly reflected the limited and controlled expansion of the human resources within our various business lines and, where needed, the supporting operating and risk management departments. The incremental increase in expense associated with these new resources was partially defrayed by our efforts to improve overall operating efficiency during fiscal 2016 that resulted in a net decrease in the number of full time equivalent ( FTE\u201d) employees for the year that was achieved largely through reallocation and attrition of resources. The increase in compensation-related expenses also included an increase in the cost of employee healthcare benefits as well as an increase in ESOP expense that was primarily attributable to the increase in the Company's average share price between comparative periods.\nThe noted increase in advertising and marketing expenses was largely attributable to expanded corporate and business line advertising campaigns across the print, electronic media and outdoor advertising formats while the reported increase in deposit insurance expense largely reflected the overall growth in the Company's total assets that serves as a contributing basis to the calculation of FDIC insurance premiums.\nThe increase in non-interest expense also reflected an increase in director compensation expense that was primarily attributable to the addition of two independent directors during fiscal 2016. This increase in director compensation was more than offset by the effect of a non-recurring curtailment gain on pension plan expense totaling $931,000 that was recognized in miscellaneous expense during fiscal 2016. The curtailment gain resulted from the amendment of the Company's Directors Consultation and Retirement Plan (the DCRP\u201d) during the year. The noted amendments froze the DCRP such that no additional DCRP benefits accrue to any participant after December 31, 2015 and revised the minimum age requirement for benefit vesting purposes.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by $8.1 million to income tax expense of $6.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from an income tax benefit of $1.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The provision for both periods reflected the effects of the Company's recurring sources of tax-favored income on taxable net income for each year. Such recurring tax-favored income sources include interest income on municipal obligations and the income arising from periodic increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance.\nHowever, the taxable portion of the Company's net income for fiscal 2015 also reflected the effects of certain non-recurring sources of non-taxable income including a $1.4 million payout on bank-owned life insurance policies. In that regard, we also recognized a non-taxable adjustment to gain on bargain purchase totaling $370,000 during fiscal 2015 relating to the acquisition of Atlas Bank that exceeded the original bargain purchase gain of $226,000 recognized on that transaction during fiscal 2014.\nIn addition to these items, the income tax provision for fiscal 2015 reflected the utilization of a net operating loss carry forward originated by Kearny MHC, our prior mutual holding company, arising from its merger into the Company in conjunction with the second step conversion and stock offering. The value of that carry-forward had not been recognized in prior years resulting in a $354,000 income tax benefit to the Company during fiscal 2015. The income tax provision for fiscal 2015 also reflected a $416,000 income tax benefit arising from the exercise of stock options during the year.\nAfter adjusting for the effects of these recurring and non-recurring factors, the overall increase in the income tax provision largely reflected the underlying differences in the taxable portion of pre-tax income between comparative periods. Our effective income tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2016 was 30.0%, which primarily reflected the effects of recurring sources of tax-favored income. By comparison, our effective income tax rate (benefit) during the year ended June 30, 2015 was (29.1)% which, in relation to statutory income tax rates, reflected the effects of the recurring and non-recurring items noted above.\nAverage Balance Sheet. The following table sets forth certain information relating to Kearny Financial at and for the periods indicated. We derived the average yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented with daily balances used to derive average balances. No tax equivalent adjustments have been made to yield or costs.\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

by cash and cash equivalents, is a product of our operating, investing and financing activities. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization, prepayments and maturities of mortgage-backed securities and outstanding loans, maturities and calls of securities and funds provided from operations. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets, such as overnight deposits, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. While scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage-backed securities and maturing securities and short-term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, general interest rates, economic conditions and competition greatly influence deposit flows and prepayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities.\nKearny Bank is required to have enough investments that qualify as liquid assets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe operation. Liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans. We attempt to maintain adequate but not excessive liquidity and liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management.\nCash and cash equivalents, consisting primarily of deposits in other banks, decreased $121.0 million to $78.2 million at June 30, 2017 from $199.2 million at June 30, 2016. The balance of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 reflected a temporary accumulation of short-term, liquid assets arising from an increase in loan prepayments during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The Company reinvested a significant portion of that excess liquidity back into the loan portfolio during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe balance of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2017 included funds on deposit at other institutions totaling $62.5 million and other cash-related items, consisting primarily of vault cash and cash held by, or in transit to/from, our cash repository service provider, totaling $15.7 million. Cash and equivalents on deposit at other institutions at June 30, 2017 included $4.8 million held by the FHLB, $53.6 million held by the FRB as well as $4.1 million held at three U.S. domestic money center banks representing funds on deposit totaling $2.3 million, $1.0 million and $824,000, respectively, at June 30, 2017.\nManagement reviews cash flow projections regularly and updates them monthly in order to maintain liquid assets at levels believed to meet the requirements of normal operations, including loan commitments and potential deposit outflows from maturing certificates of deposit and other deposit withdrawals. At June 30, 2017, Kearny Bank had commitments to originate and purchase loans totaling $95.2 million compared to $35.6 million at June 30, 2016. As of those same comparative dates, construction loans in process and unused lines of credit were $8.1 and $60.7 million, respectively, compared to $73,000 and $55.4 million, respectively. Kearny Bank had $610.8 million of certificates of deposit maturing in one year at June 30, 2017 compared to $666.1 million at June 30, 2016.\nDeposits increased $235.3 million to $2.93 billion at June 30, 2017 from $2.69 billion at June 30, 2016. Between those comparative periods, non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased $28.7 million to $267.4 million, interest-bearing demand deposits increased $115.0 million to $847.7 million, savings and club deposits increased $8.0 million to $524.0 million while certificates of deposit increased $83.6 million to $1.29 billion.\nBorrowings from the FHLB of New York and other sources are generally available to supplement Kearny Bank's liquidity position and to the extent that maturing deposits do not remain with us, management may replace the funds with such borrowings. Kearny Bank has the capacity to borrow additional funds from the FHLB by taking additional long-term or short-term advances including overnight borrowings. As of June 30, 2017, Kearny Bank's borrowing potential was $882.1 million without pledging additional collateral.\nThe following table sets forth information concerning balances and interest rates on

to the loan commitments noted above, the Company has outstanding commitments to originate loans held for sale totaling $18.4 million at June 30, 2017. Origination commitments on loans held for sale whose terms include interest rate locks to borrowers are generally paired with a non-binding\u201d best-efforts commitment to sell the loan to a buyer at a fixed price and within a predetermined timeframe after the sale commitment is established.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of our business of investing in loans and securities as well as in the normal course of maintaining and improving Kearny Bank's facilities. These financial instruments include significant purchase commitments, such as commitments related to capital expenditure plans and commitments to purchase securities or mortgage-backed securities and commitments to extend credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. We had no significant off-balance sheet commitments to purchase securities as of June 30, 2017.\nIn addition to the commitments noted above, Kearny Bank is party to standby letters of credit totaling approximately $715,000 at June 30, 2017 through which we guarantee certain specific business obligations of our commercial customers.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nAt June 30, 2017, outstanding loan commitments relating to loans held in portfolio totaled $163.9 million compared to $91.0 million at June 30, 2016. As of that same date, the Company also had outstanding commitments to originate loans held for sale totaling $18.4 million that are considered derivative instruments whose values are not considered to be material for financial statement reporting purposes. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. For additional information regarding our outstanding lending commitments at June 30, 2017, see Note 14 and Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nCapital\nConsistent with our goals to operate as a sound and profitable financial organization, Kearny Financial and Kearny Bank actively seek to maintain our well capitalized status in accordance with regulatory standards. As of June 30, 2017, Kearny Financial and Kearny Bank exceeded all capital requirements of the federal banking regulators and were considered well capitalized\u201d.\nKearny Bank's regulatory capital ratios at June 30, 2017 were as follows: Tier 1 leverage ratio 15.47%; Common Equity Tier I risk-based capital 22.39%; Tier I risk-based capital 22.39%; and total risk-based capital 23.30%.\nKearny Financial's regulatory capital ratios at June 30, 2017 were as follows: Tier 1 leverage ratio 20.11%; Common Equity Tier I risk-based capital 29.08%; Tier I risk-based capital 29.08%; and total risk-based capital 29.98%.\nThe regulatory capital requirements to be considered well capitalized at June 30, 2017 were as follows: Tier 1 leverage ratio 5.0%; Common Equity Tier I risk-based capital 6.5%; Tier I risk-based capital 8.0%; and total risk-based capital 10.0%.\nFor additional information regarding regulatory capital at June 30, 2017, see Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe financial statements included in this document have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.\nOur primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates, however, do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation. In a period of rapidly rising interest rates, the liquidity and maturities of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels.\nThe principal effect of inflation on earnings, as distinct from levels of interest rates, is in the area of non-interest expense. Expense items such as employee compensation, employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation. An additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in the dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made. We are unable to determine the extent, if any, to which properties securing our loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of the expected impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements that have yet to be adopted by us, please refer to Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThis discussion and analysis reflects Kearny Financial Corp.'s consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data, and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding Kearny Financial Corp. and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nFinancial Condition. Total assets increased $318.1 million to $4.82 billion at June 30, 2017 from $4.50 billion at June 30, 2016. The increase in total assets reflected an increase in net loans receivable that was partially offset by decreases in securities and cash and cash equivalents. The increase in total assets was largely funded by increases in deposits and borrowings that were partially offset by a decrease in stockholders' equity. The decrease in stockholders' equity primarily reflected the Company's share repurchases that outpaced the accretion from earnings during the year.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2017, loans receivable, excluding loans held for sale, increased by $571.3 million to $3.25 billion, or 72.8% of earning assets, at June 30, 2017 from $2.67 billion, or 64.6% of earning assets, at June 30, 2016. The growth in loans during fiscal 2017 continued to reflect our strategic emphasis in growing our commercial loan portfolio, including multi-family loans, nonresidential mortgage loans and commercial business loans. The increase in commercial mortgage and commercial business loans during fiscal 2017 totaled $622.9 million, or 32.0%, to $2.57 billion, or 79.3% of total loans at June 30, 2017, from $1.95 billion, or 73.0% of total loans, at June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, one- to four-family mortgage loans, including first mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, decreased by $44.6 million to $650.1 million, or 20.1% of total loans, from $694.8 million, or 26.0% of total loans.\nFor those same comparative periods, total securities decreased by $146.1 million to $1.11 billion, or 24.9% of earning assets, at June 30, 2017 from $1.26 billion, or 30.3% of earning assets, at June 30, 2016. We generally maintained the overall composition of our securities portfolio during fiscal 2017 while adding subordinated debt as an eligible non-mortgage-backed security sector within the portfolio. However, for interest rate risk management purposes, security balances were modestly reallocated during fiscal 2017 to increase investment in shorter duration, floating-rate sectors within the non-mortgage-backed securities portfolio while investment in comparatively longer duration, fixed-rate securities in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio declined. Non-mortgage-backed securities, including U.S. agency debentures, corporate bonds, single-issuer trust preferred securities, collateralized loan obligations, municipal obligations, subordinated debt, and asset-backed securities, increased by $32.2 million to $589.2 million, or 53.2% of securities, at June 30, 2017 from $557.1 million, or 44.5% of securities, at June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the balance of mortgage-backed securities, primarily comprising U.S. government and agency pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, decreased by $175.9 million to $517.9 million, or 46.8% of securities, from $693.7 million, or 55.5% of securities.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2017, our total deposits increased by $235.3 million to $2.93 billion from $2.69 billion at June 30, 2016. The net increase in deposits reflected a $151.7 million increase in the balance of non-maturity deposits, including a $28.7 million increase in the balance of non-interest-bearing accounts, coupled with an $83.6 million increase in certificates of deposit.\nThe balance of borrowings increased by $191.8 million to $806.2 million at June 30, 2017 from $614.4 million at June 30, 2016. The increase in borrowings was primarily attributable to a $196.9 million net increase in FHLB advances representing new advances drawn to fund a portion of the loan growth reported during fiscal 2017 that were partially offset by the balance of advances repaid during the year. Interest rate derivatives were used to effectively extend duration of the new borrowings drawn for interest rate risk management purposes. The increase in borrowings was partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in the balance of overnight borrowings in the form of depositor sweep accounts.\nStockholders' equity decreased by $90.4 million to $1.06 billion at June 30, 2017 from $1.15 billion at June 30, 2016. The decrease in stockholders' equity largely reflected the impact of the Company's share repurchases during fiscal 2017. For the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company repurchased a total of 8,886,627 shares, at a total cost of $126.0 million, or an average cost of 14.18 per share. The noted decrease in stockholders' equity was partially offset by net income of $18.6 million, from which cash dividends of $8.4 million were declared and payable to shareholders during fiscal 2017. The change in stockholders' equity also reflected a $17.8 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income arising from changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities and derivatives portfolios and a $1.9 million decrease in unearned ESOP reflecting the effects of shares earned by plan participants during the year.\nResults of Operations. Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.\nIt is a function of the average balances of loans and investments versus deposits and borrowed funds outstanding in any one period and the yields earned on those loans and investments and the cost of those deposits and borrowed funds. Our results of operations are also affected by our provision for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense.\nNet income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was $18.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share; an increase of $2.8 million from $15.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.\nOur net interest income increased $7.6 million to $102.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $95.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected a $12.2 million increase in interest income to $139.1 million from $126.9 million. The increase in interest income primarily reflected an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets coupled with an increase in their average yield. For the year ended June 30, 2017, the average balance of interest-earning assets increased by $200.6 million to $4.25 billion compared to $4.05 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average yield on interest-earning assets increased by 14 basis points to 3.27% from 3.13%.\nThe increase in interest income for the year ended June 30, 2017 was partially offset by a $4.6 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest expense between the two periods reflected an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost. For the year ended June 30, 2017 the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $244.2 million to $3.22 billion compared to $2.97 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased six basis points to 1.13% from 1.07%.\nThe net interest rate spread increased eight basis points to 2.14% for fiscal 2017 from 2.06% for fiscal 2016 while the net interest margin increased six basis points to 2.41% from 2.35% for those same comparative periods.\nThe provision for loan losses decreased $5.3 million to $5.4 million for fiscal 2017 from $10.7 million for fiscal 2016. The decrease in provision expense partly reflected a net decrease in specific losses recognized on loans evaluated individually for impairment. This decrease was primarily reflected in the lower level of net charge offs recognized on such loans between comparative periods. The decrease in net charge offs also contributed to a decrease in the historical loss factors utilized to measure impairment on collectively evaluated loans. Taken together with the updates to environmental loss factors, the provision expense for loans collectively evaluated for impairment decreased year-over-year. To a lesser extent, the net decrease in the provision expense reflected slightly lower growth in the outstanding balance of loans collectively evaluated for impairment during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.\nNon-interest income increased $621,000 to $11.3 million for fiscal 2017 from $10.7 million for fiscal 2016. The increase was largely attributable to an increase in loan sale gains that partly reflected an increase in the volume of residential mortgage loans originated and sold as the Company continued to expand its mortgage banking business line throughout fiscal 2017. The increase in loan sale gains also reflected an increase in the volume of SBA loans originated and sold. The noted increase in non-interest income was partially offset by a decrease in income arising from our investment in bank-owned life insurance due largely to the lingering effects of lower market interest rates on the income earned on the cash surrender value of the various policies held by the Company. The increase in non-interest income was also partially offset by a decrease in fees and service charges that was largely attributable to a decrease in deposit-related service charges coupled with a lesser decrease in loan prepayment charges.\nNon-interest expense increased by $8.7 million to $81.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $72.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was reflected across most categories of non-interest expense with the most noteworthy increases reflected in salaries and employee benefits, director compensation and miscellaneous expenses.\nAs described in greater detail below, the increases in salaries and employee benefits and director compensation expense each reflected the impact of the Company's 2016 Equity Incentive Plan approved by shareholders in October 2016. The increase in salaries and employee benefits also reflected increases in employee compensation costs arising from an increase in the number of employees during the year as well as increases in health insurance and retirement-related employee benefit plans.\nIn addition to reflecting the noted impact of the costs associated with the Company's 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, the increase in director compensation expense also reflected an increase in director fees attributable to the addition of two independent directors during the prior fiscal year whose full-year\u201d annual compensation expense were fully reflected during fiscal 2017.\nWhile reflecting a variety of increases across a number of general and administrative expenses, the increase in miscellaneous expense for fiscal 2017 reflected the effect of the Company's recognition of a non-recurring recovery of director pension plan expense during the prior fiscal year.\nFinally, the noted increases in non-interest expense were partially offset by a decrease in deposit insurance expense that largely reflected a decrease in the assessment rate charged by the FDIC during fiscal 2017.\nThe combined effects of the factors highlighted above resulted in a $4.8 million increase in pre-tax net income and a corresponding $2.0 million increase in income tax expense during fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. We describe them in detail in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included as an exhibit to this document. In preparing the audited consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of financial condition and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the evaluation of securities impairment and the impairment testing of goodwill.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects our estimation of the losses in our loan portfolio to the extent they are both probable and reasonable to estimate. The balance of the allowance is generally maintained through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income in the period that estimated losses on loans are identified by our loan review system. We charge losses on loans against the allowance as such losses are actually incurred. Recoveries on loans previously charged-off are added back to the allowance.\nAs described in greater detail in the notes to audited consolidated financial statements, our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology utilizes a two-tier\u201d loss measurement process that is generally performed monthly. Through the first tier of the process, we identify the loans that must be reviewed individually for impairment. Such loans generally include our larger and/or more complex loans including commercial mortgage loans, comprising multi-family and nonresidential real estate loans, construction loans and commercial business loans as well as our one- to four-family mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. A reviewed loan is deemed to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Once a loan is determined to be impaired, management measures the amount of the estimated impairment associated with that loan which is generally defined as the amount by which the carrying value of a loan exceeds its fair value. We establish valuation allowances for loan impairments in the fiscal period during which they are identified. Impairments on individually evaluated loans generally are charged off against the applicable valuation allowance when they are determined to be confirmed, expected losses.\nThe second tier of the loss measurement process involves estimating the probable and estimable losses on loans not otherwise individually reviewed for impairment. Such loans generally comprise large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans as well as the remaining non-impaired loans of those types noted above that are otherwise eligible for individual impairment evaluation.\nValuation allowances established through the second tier of the loss measurement process utilize historical and environmental loss factors to collectively estimate the level of probable losses within defined segments of our loan portfolio. To calculate the historical loss factors, our allowance for loan loss methodology generally utilizes a two-year moving average of annualized net charge-off rates (charge-offs net of recoveries) by loan segment, where available, to calculate the actual, historical loss experience. The outstanding principal balance of each loan segment is multiplied by the applicable historical loss factor to estimate the level of probable losses based upon our historical loss experience.\nEnvironmental loss factors are based upon specific quantitative and qualitative criteria representing key sources of risk within the loan portfolio. Such sources of risk include those relating to the level of and trends in nonperforming loans; the level of and trends in credit risk management effectiveness, the levels and trends in lending resource capability; levels and trends in economic and market conditions; levels and trends in loan concentrations; levels and trends in loan composition and terms, levels and trends in independent loan review effectiveness, levels and trends in collateral values and the effects of other external factors. The outstanding principal balance of each loan segment is multiplied by the applicable environmental loss factors to estimate the level of probable losses based upon their supporting quantitative and qualitative criteria.\nThe sum of the probable and estimable loan losses calculated in accordance with loss measurement processes, as described above, represents the total targeted balance for our allowance for loan losses at the end of a fiscal period. A more detailed discussion of our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology is presented in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment Testing of Goodwill. We record goodwill, representing the excess of amounts paid over the fair value of net assets of the institutions acquired in purchase transactions, at its fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested and deemed impaired when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Goodwill was most recently tested as of June 30, 2017, at which\ntime no impairment was indicated. As of that date, we reported goodwill of $108.6 million. The value of the goodwill can change in the future. We expect the value of the goodwill to decrease if there is a significant decrease in the franchise value of Kearny Bank. If an impairment is determined in the future, we will reflect the loss as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined, leading to a reduction of our net income for that period by the amount of the impairment.\nOther-than-Temporary Impairment ( OTTI\u201d) of Securities. If the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost, the security is deemed to be impaired. Management evaluates all securities with unrealized losses quarterly to determine if such impairments are temporary\u201d or other-than-temporary\u201d in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.\nWe account for temporary impairments based upon the classification of the related security as either available for sale, held to maturity or trading. Temporary impairments on available for sale\u201d securities are recognized, on a tax-effected basis, through accumulated other comprehensive income with offsetting entries adjusting the carrying value of the security and the balance of deferred taxes. Conversely, we do not adjust the carrying value of held to maturity\u201d securities for temporary impairments, although information concerning the amount and duration of impairments on held to maturity securities is generally disclosed in periodic financial statements. The carrying value of securities held in a trading portfolio is adjusted to their fair value through earnings on a daily basis. However, we maintained no securities in trading portfolios at or during the periods presented in these financial statements.\nWe account for OTTI based upon several considerations. First, OTTI on securities that we have decided to sell as of the close of a fiscal period, or will, more likely than not, be required to sell prior to the full recovery of their fair value to a level equal to or exceeding their amortized cost, are recognized in earnings. If neither of these conditions regarding the likelihood of the security's sale is applicable, then the OTTI is bifurcated into credit-related and noncredit-related components. A credit-related impairment generally represents the amount by which the present value of the cash flows that are expected to be collected on an other-than-temporarily impaired security fall below its amortized cost. The noncredit-related component represents the remaining portion of the impairment not otherwise designated as credit-related. We recognize credit-related, OTTI in earnings. However, noncredit-related, other-than-temporary impairments on debt securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nComparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016\nGeneral. Total assets increased $318.1 million to $4.82 billion at June 30, 2017 from $4.50 billion at June 30, 2016. The net increase in total assets primarily reflected an increase in net loans receivable that was partially offset by decreases in balances of securities and cash and cash equivalents. The net increase in total assets was largely funded by increases in deposits and borrowings that were partially offset by a net decrease in stockholders' equity.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents, which consist primarily of interest-earning and non-interest-earning deposits in other banks, decreased by $121.0 million to $78.2 million at June 30, 2017 from $199.2 million at June 30, 2016. The balance of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 reflected the effects of temporary accumulation of short-term, liquid assets arising from an increase in loan prepayments during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The average balance of cash and equivalents decreased steadily in fiscal 2017 reflecting the Company's ongoing effort to enhance earnings by generally reducing the level of lower-yielding, short-term liquid assets to the amount needed to fund the Company's strategic initiatives while meeting its performance and risk management objectives.\nDebt Securities Available for Sale. Debt securities classified as available for sale increased by $54.6 million to $444.5 million at June 30, 2017 from $389.9 million at June 30, 2016. The net increase in the portfolio partly reflected security purchases totaling $138.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 coupled with a $10.8 million decrease in the net unrealized loss of the portfolio to a net unrealized loss of $1.4 million at June 30, 2017 from a net unrealized loss of $12.2 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease in the net unrealized loss reflected changes in the fair value of various sectors within the portfolio arising from movements in market interest rates coupled with a tightening of pricing spreads within certain sectors in the portfolio. The noted increases in the portfolio were partially offset by principal repayments, net of premium amortization and discount accretion, totaling $94.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nThe net unrealized loss on debt securities available for sale was primarily reflected within the applicable credit sectors\u201d of the portfolio which include asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, corporate bonds and non-pooled trust preferred securities. The net unrealized loss on this subset of securities decreased by $11.6 million to a net unrealized loss of $1.7 million at June 30, 2017 from a net unrealized loss of $13.3 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease in the unrealized loss largely reflected a general tightening of pricing spreads in the marketplace resulting in an overall increase in the market price of such securities. The decrease in the net unrealized loss on the noted securities was partially offset by a $755,000 decline in the fair value of government and agency securities, including U.S. agency debentures and municipal obligations, to an unrealized loss of $287,000 at June 30, 2017 from an unrealized gain of $1.0 million at June 30, 2016.\nBased on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of June 30, 2017. However, volatility in the financial markets may result in additional decreases in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities. Such volatility may impact the fair value of the securities within the credit sectors\u201d of the portfolio more adversely than the Company's government and agency securities. The adverse effects of such volatility on the current and prospective financial strength of specific corporate issuers, and the resulting impact on the fair value of the related securities held by the Company, will be carefully monitored by management.\nMortgage-backed Securities Available for Sale. Mortgage-backed securities available for sale decreased by $114.3 million to $169.3 million at June 30, 2017 from $283.6 million at June 30, 2016. The net decrease partly reflected security sales totaling $83.4 million coupled with cash repayment of principal, net of discount accretion and premium amortization, totaling $53.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2017 while also reflecting a $8.5 million decrease in the fair value of the portfolio to a net unrealized loss of $986,000 at June 30, 2017 from a net unrealized gain of $7.5 million at June 30, 2016. These decreases in the portfolio were partially offset by security purchases totaling $30.7 million during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nAt June 30, 2017, the available for sale mortgage-backed securities portfolio primarily included agency pass-through securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nAdditional information regarding securities available for sale at June 30, 2017 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 4 and Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nDebt Securities Held to Maturity. Debt securities classified as held to maturity decreased by $22.5 million to $144.7 million at June 30, 2017 from $167.2 million at June 30, 2016. The net decrease in the portfolio largely reflected principal repayments, net of premium amortization and discount accretion, totaling $56.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2017. The net decrease was partially offset by debt security purchases totaling $34.4 million during the same period. Such purchases included the purchase of $15.0 million in subordinated debt issued by a New Jersey-based community bank through a privately negotiated transaction during the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nAt June 30, 2017, the held to maturity debt securities portfolio also included U.S. agency debentures and municipal obligations, a small portion of which represent non-rated, short term, bond anticipation notes ( BANs\u201d) issued by New Jersey municipalities. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nMortgage-backed Securities Held to Maturity. Mortgage-backed securities held to maturity decreased by $61.5 million to $348.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $410.1 million at June 30, 2016. The net decrease in the portfolio partly reflected security sales totaling $5.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2017, coupled with cash repayment of principal, net of discount accretion and premium amortization, totaling $56.4 million. The securities sold were limited to those whose remaining outstanding balances had declined to the required thresholds, in relation to the original amount purchased or acquired, that allowed their sale from the held to maturity portfolio.\nAt June 30, 2017, the held to maturity mortgage-backed securities portfolio primarily included agency pass-through securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations. As of that date, we also held three non-agency mortgage-backed securities in the held to maturity portfolio whose aggregate carrying values and fair values both totaled $22,000. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nAdditional information regarding securities available for sale at June 30, 2017 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 4 and Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nLoans Held-for-Sale. The Company continues to expand its residential lending infrastructure to support strategies focused on increasing the origination volume of residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. The increase in residential mortgage loan origination and sale activity has increased the Company's level of non-interest income through the recognition of additional sources of recurring loan sale gains while serving to help manage the Company's exposure to interest rate risk. During the year ended June 30, 2017, we sold $84.4 million of residential mortgage loans resulting in net sale gains totaling $713,000 for fiscal 2017. Loans held for sale totaled $4.7 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $3.3 million at June 30, 2016 and are reported separately from the balance of net loans receivable as of those dates.\nLoans Receivable. Loans receivable, net of unamortized premiums, deferred costs and the allowance for loan losses, increased by $566.2 million, or 21.4%, to $3.22 billion at June 30, 2017 from $2.65 billion at June 30, 2016. The increase in net loans receivable\nwas primarily attributable to new loan origination and purchase volume outpacing loan repayments during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nResidential mortgage loans held in portfolio, including home equity loans and lines of credit, decreased by $44.7 million to $650.1 million at June 30, 2017 from $694.8 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the balance of one- to four-family first mortgage loans of $37.9 million to $567.3 million at June 30, 2017 from $605.2 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease also reflected an aggregate decrease of $6.8 million in the balance of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit to $82.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $89.6 million at June 30, 2016.\nNotwithstanding the decrease in their balance during the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company may modestly increase the outstanding balance of residential mortgage loans held in portfolio in the future while allowing the segment to continue to decline as a percentage of total loans and earning assets. In total, the origination volume of portfolio residential mortgage loans for the year ended June 30, 2017 totaled $67.9 million while aggregate originations of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit totaled $18.5 million for that same period.\nCommercial loans, in aggregate, increased by $622.9 million to $2.57 billion at June 30, 2017 from $1.95 billion at June 30, 2016. The components of the aggregate increase included an increase in commercial mortgage loans totaling $636.7 million that was partially offset by a $13.7 million decrease in commercial business loans. The ending balances of commercial mortgage loans and commercial business loans at June 30, 2017 were $2.50 billion and $74.5 million, respectively.\nCommercial loan origination volume for the year ended June 30, 2017 totaled $761.5 million, comprised of $727.4 million and $34.1 million of commercial mortgage and commercial business loan originations, respectively. Commercial loan originations were augmented with the purchase of commercial mortgage loans and participations totaling $126.7 million coupled with the purchase of commercial business loans totaling $17.0 million during the year ended June 30, 2017. Commercial mortgage loan purchases were funded during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with the excess liquidity that had accumulated during the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe outstanding balance of construction loans, net of loans-in-process, increased by $1.8 million to $3.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $2.0 million at June 30, 2016. Construction loan disbursements for the year ended June 30, 2017 totaled $3.0 million.\nOther loans, primarily account loans, deposit account overdraft lines of credit and other consumer loans, decreased by $9.0 million to $16.4 million at June 30, 2017 from $25.4 million at June 30, 2016. The balance of other consumer loans at June 30, 2017 included loans with outstanding balances totaling $12.8 million that were acquired through the Company's relationship with Lending Club, an established peer-to-peer (i.e. marketplace) lender. Through this relationship, the Company has purchased high-quality, unsecured consumer loans originated through Lending Club's online platform. The Company limited its original investment in the Lending Club loan portfolio to an initial threshold of approximately $25.0 million in aggregate outstanding balances and continues to independently monitor and validate the performance of the portfolio in relation to Company's expectations as well as those of Lending Club's proprietary credit risk model. Additional investment in Lending Club loans up to this initial threshold may be considered by the Company while it continues to monitor and assess the performance of the portfolio and quality of loan servicing and reporting rendered by Lending Club.\nThe Company originated $1.8 million of consumer loans during the year ended June 30, 2017 while no additional consumer loans were purchased during the period.\nNonperforming Loans. Nonperforming loans decreased by $2.2 million to $18.9 million, or 0.58% of total loans at June 30, 2017, from $21.1 million, or 0.79% of total loans at June 30, 2016. Nonperforming loans generally include loans reported as accruing loans over 90 days past due\u201d and loans reported as nonaccrual\u201d with such balances totaling $74,000 and $18.8 million, respectively, at June 30, 2017.\nAdditional information about the Company's nonperforming loans at June 30, 2017 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. During the year ended June 30, 2017, the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased by $5.1 million to $29.3 million or 0.90% of total loans at June 30, 2017 from $24.2 million or 0.91% of total loans at June 30, 2016. The increase resulted from provisions of $5.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2017 that were partially offset by charge-offs, net of recoveries, totaling $324,000 during that same period.\nAdditional information about the allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2017 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K as well as in Note 1 and Note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nOther Assets. The aggregate balance of other assets, including premises and equipment, FHLB stock, interest receivable, goodwill, bank owned life insurance, deferred income taxes and other miscellaneous assets, increased by $15.1 million to $412.1 million at June 30, 2017 from $397.0 million at June 30, 2016.\nThe increase in other assets partly reflected an increase in the fair value of the Company's interest rate derivatives portfolio to a net asset value of $7.8 million, included in other assets at June 30, 2017, compared to a net liability value of $19.3 million, included in other liabilities at June 30, 2016. The increase in other assets also included a $9.3 million increase in FHLB stock resulting from an increase in short-term advances drawn during the year ended June 30, 2017 coupled with a $5.2 million increase in the cash surrender value of the Company's bank-owned life insurance policies for the same period. The noted increases in other assets were partially offset by a $10.5 million decrease in deferred income tax assets arising primarily from changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities and derivatives portfolios.\nThe noted increases in other assets included a $806,000 increase in the balance of real estate owned ( REO\u201d) to $1.6 million representing the carrying value of four properties at June 30, 2017, from $826,000, representing the carrying value of three properties at June 30, 2016.\nThe remaining increases and decreases in other assets for the year ended June 30, 2017 generally comprised normal operating fluctuations in their respective balances.\nDeposits. Total deposits increased by $235.3 million to $2.93 billion at June 30, 2017 from $2.69 billion at June 30, 2016. The increase in deposit balances reflected a $206.6 million increase in interest-bearing deposits coupled with a $28.7 million increase in non-interest-bearing deposits. The increase in interest-bearing deposits included an increase in the balance of interest-bearing checking accounts totaling $115.0 million as well as increases in balances of certificates of deposit and savings and club accounts totaling $83.6 million and $8.0 million, respectively.\nThe noted increase in non-interest-bearing deposits partly reflected fluctuating balances within certain large commercial deposit accounts. Notwithstanding these day-to-day fluctuations, the average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits has increased by $24.3 million to $249.7 million compared to $225.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe change in deposit balances for the period reflected changes in the balances of retail deposits as well as non-retail\u201d deposits acquired through various wholesale channels. The $115.0 million increase in the balance of interest-bearing checking accounts primarily reflected an increase in the balance of retail accounts while the balance of brokered money market deposits acquired through Promontory IND program totaled $222.6 million, or 7.6% of total deposits at June 30, 2017, compared to $224.1 million, or 8.3% of total deposits at June 30, 2016. The terms of the IND program generally establish a reciprocal commitment for Promontory to deliver and for us to accept such deposits for a period of no less than five years during which time total aggregate balances shall be maintained within a range of $200.0 million to $230.0 million. Such deposits are generally sourced by Promontory from large retail and institutional brokerage firms whose individual clients seek to have a portion of their investments held in interest-bearing accounts at FDIC-insured institutions.\nWe continued to utilize a deposit listing service through which we attract non-brokered\u201d wholesale time deposits targeting institutional investors with an original investment horizon of two-to-five years. We generally prohibit the withdrawal of our listing service deposits prior to maturity. The balance of the Bank's listing service time deposits increased to $101.4 million, or 3.5% of total deposits at June 30, 2017, compared to $89.9 million, or 3.3% of total deposits at June 30, 2016.\nWe also maintain a small portfolio of longer-term, brokered certificates of deposit whose balances increased by approximately $13.2 million to $21.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $8.4 million at June 30, 2016. In combination with our Promontory IND money market deposits, our brokered deposits totaled $244.2 million, or 8.3% of deposits at June 30, 2017 compared to $232.5 million, or 8.6% of deposits at June 30, 2016.\nBorrowings. The balance of borrowings increased by $191.8 million to $806.2 million at June 30, 2017 from $614.4 million at June 30, 2016. The increase in borrowings primarily reflected an additional $200.0 million of short-term FHLB advances drawn to fund a portion of our growth in loans during fiscal 2017. We utilized interest rate derivatives to effectively swap the rolling 90-day maturity/repricing characteristics of these new borrowings into fixed rates for longer terms. Of the $200.0 million of new advances, $150.0 million were swapped to fixed rate for four years while the remaining $50.0 million were swapped to a fixed rate for five years.\nThe increase in short-term FHLB advances was partially offset by the repayment of a $3.0 million FHLB term advance that matured during the period coupled with principal payments that reduced the outstanding balance of one amortizing advance. Additionally, the net change in borrowings reflected a $5.1 million decrease in outstanding overnight sweep account\u201d balances linked\nto customer demand deposits that generally reflected internal transfers to interest-bearing checking accounts as well as normal operating fluctuations in such balances.\nOther Liabilities. The balance of other liabilities, including advance payments by borrowers for taxes and other miscellaneous liabilities, decreased by $18.6 million to $24.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $43.2 million at June 30, 2016. As noted earlier, the decrease primarily reflected changes in the fair value of the Company's derivatives coupled with normal operating fluctuations in the balances of other liabilities.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company executed a total of seven interest rate derivative transactions with an aggregate notional value of $640.0 million. Five of the transactions, totaling $440.0 million, represent interest rate swaps with a forward\u201d effective date that corresponds to the expiration date of one or more existing derivatives with the same aggregate notional value. As such, each of these five new derivatives effectively extends the interest rate risk protection provided by one or more existing derivatives that currently serve as cash flow hedges against existing sources of wholesale funding. The remaining two derivative transactions were those extending the effective duration of the new advances drawn during the year ended June 30, 2017, as discussed above.\nStockholders' Equity. Stockholders' equity decreased by $90.4 million to $1.06 billion at June 30, 2017 from $1.15 billion at June 30, 2016. The decrease in stockholders' equity largely reflected the impact of the Company's share repurchases during fiscal 2017. In May 2017, the Company announced the completion of its first share repurchase program, originally announced in May 2016, through which it repurchased a total of 9,352,809 shares, or 10%, of its outstanding shares at a total cost of $130.6 million and an average cost of $13.96 per share. Concurrently, the Company announced its second share repurchase program through which it intends to repurchase a total of 8,559,084 shares, or 10%, of its outstanding shares. Through June 30, 2017, the Company has repurchased 1,240,000 shares, or 14.5% of the shares to be repurchased under its second share repurchase plan, at a total cost of $17.7 million and at an average cost of $14.30 per share. Cumulatively for the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company repurchased a total of 8,886,627 shares, at a total cost of $126.0 million, or an average cost of 14.18 per share. The cumulative cost of the Company's repurchased shares has directly reduced the balance of stockholders' equity at June 30, 2017.\nThe net decrease in stockholders' equity was partially offset by net income of $18.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from which cash dividends of $8.4 million were declared and payable to shareholders during the period. The change in stockholders' equity also reflected a $17.8 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, due primarily to changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities portfolio and outstanding derivatives, and a $1.9 million reduction of unearned ESOP shares for plan shares earned by plan participants during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nAt June 30, 2017, the Company had 84,350,848 shares outstanding, comprising 93,528,092 shares originally issued, plus 1,415,565 net shares issued and cancelled relating to stock benefit plan obligations less 10,592,809 cumulative shares repurchased and cancelled through that date.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended June 30, 2017 was $18.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share, an increase of $2.8 million from $15.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in net income reflected increases in net interest income and non-interest income coupled with a decrease in the provision for loan losses that were partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense. These factors contributed to an overall increase in pre-tax net income and a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2017 was $102.6 million; an increase of $7.6 million from $95.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in net interest income between the comparative periods resulted from an increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets coupled with an increase in their average yield. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost.\nAs a result of these factors, our net interest rate spread increased eight basis points to 2.14% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 2.06% for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in the net interest rate spread reflected a 14 basis points increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets to 3.27% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 3.13% for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by six basis points to 1.13% from 1.07%. A discussion of the factors contributing to changes in the average yield and average cost of categories within interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, is presented in the separate discussion and analysis of interest income and interest expense below.\nThe factors resulting in the reported increase in our net interest rate spread also affected our net interest margin. In total, the Company's net interest margin increased six basis points to 2.41% for the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to 2.35% for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $12.2 million to $139.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $126.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. As noted above, the increase in interest income partly reflected a $200.6 million increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $4.25 billion for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $4.05 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the yield on earning assets increased by 14 basis points to 3.27% from 3.13%.\nInterest income from loans increased $13.2 million to $111.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $98.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in interest income on loans was attributable to a net increase in the average balance of loans that was partially offset by a decline in their average yield.\nThe average balance of loans increased by $443.5 million to $2.96 billion for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $2.51 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. The reported increase in the average balance of loans primarily reflected an aggregate increase of $483.7 million in the average balance of commercial loans to $2.27 billion for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $1.78 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average balance of other loans, primarily comprising unsecured consumer term loans, account loans and deposit account overdraft lines of credit, increased by $5.1 million to $20.6 million from $15.5 million. The increase in the average balance of other loans primarily reflected the increased balance of unsecured consumer term loans acquired through Lending Club, as described earlier.\nThe increase in the average balance of commercial and consumer loans was partially offset by a $43.3 million decrease in the average balance of residential mortgage loans to $663.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $706.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of construction loans decreased by $2.6 million to $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $4.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe effect on interest income attributable to the net increase in the average balance of loans was partially offset by the noted decrease in their average yield. The average yield on loans decreased by 14 basis points to 3.76% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 3.90% for the year ended June 30, 2016. The reduction in the overall yield on our loan portfolio largely reflected the effect of the comparatively lower average yield on most newly originated loans in relation to that of the portfolio of existing loans which has reduced the overall yield of the aggregate portfolio. To a lesser extent, the decline in the average yield generally reflects the effects of low market interest rates that provide rate reduction\u201d refinancing incentive to existing borrowers while also contributing to the downward re-pricing of adjustable rate loans.\nInterest income from mortgage-backed securities decreased by $3.3 million to $14.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $17.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in interest income reflected a decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities coupled with a decrease in their average yield.\nThe average balance of mortgage-backed securities decreased by $119.5 million to $621.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $741.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities largely reflected the level of aggregate principal repayments and security sales between comparative periods outpacing aggregate security purchases.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average yield on mortgage-backed securities decreased by eight basis points to 2.25% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 2.33% for the year ended June 30, 2016. The reduction in the overall yield on mortgage-backed securities largely reflected the effect of the comparatively lower average yield on purchased securities in relation to that of the existing portfolio coupled with the continuing repayment of comparatively higher yielding securities within the portfolio.\nInterest income from debt securities increased by $1.9 million to $11.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $9.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in interest income reflected an increase in the average yield on debt securities that was partially offset by a decrease in their average balance. The average yield on debt securities increased 47 basis points to 2.12% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 1.65% for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in yield was largely attributable to floating rate securities whose interest rates have increased due to recent increases in short-term market interest rates. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of debt securities decreased $43.0 million to $559.4 million from $602.4 million.\nThe increase in the average yield on debt securities reflected a 57 basis points increase in the yield on taxable securities to 2.14% during the year ended June 30, 2017 from 1.57% during the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the yield on tax-exempt securities increased two basis points to 2.01% from 1.99%.\nThe decrease in the average balance of debt securities was largely attributable to a $47.5 million decrease in the average balance of taxable securities to $444.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $492.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in taxable securities was partially offset by a $4.5 million increase in the average balance of tax-exempt securities to $114.5 million from $110.0 million.\nInterest income from other interest-earning assets increased by $298,000 to $2.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 reflecting an increase in their average yield that was partially offset by a decrease in their average balance. The average yield on other interest-earning assets increased by 90 basis points to 1.81% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 0.91% for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of other interest-earning assets decreased by $80.3 million to $114.1 million from $194.5 million. The increase in average yield and decrease in the average balance of other interest earning assets largely reflected the Company's efforts to reduce the opportunity cost of maintaining excess liquidity by reinvesting a portion of cash and cash equivalents into the loan portfolio during the current fiscal year.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased by $4.6 million to $36.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $31.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. As noted earlier, the increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $244.2 million to $3.22 billion for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $2.97 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased six basis points to 1.13% from 1.07%.\nInterest expense attributed to deposits increased by $3.4 million to $22.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $18.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in interest expense was attributable to increases in the average cost and average balance of interest-bearing deposits.\nThe average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased by eight basis points to 0.87% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 0.79% for the year ended June 30, 2016. The net increase in the average cost largely reflected an increase in the average cost of certificates of deposit, which increased 10 basis points to 1.32% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 1.22% for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing checking accounts increased seven basis points to 0.66% from 0.59% while the average cost of savings and club accounts decreased three basis points to 0.13% from 0.16%.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by $175.9 million to $2.53 billion for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $2.36 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in the average balance was reflected across all categories of interest-bearing deposits. For the comparative periods noted, the average balance of certificates of deposit increased by $126.0 million to $1.24 billion from $1.12 billion, the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts increased by $46.8 million to $769.9 million from $723.1 million and the average balance of savings and club accounts increased by $3.1 million to $519.5 million from $516.4 million.\nInterest expense attributed to borrowings increased by $1.2 million to $14.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $13.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in interest expense on borrowings reflected an increase in their average balance that was partially offset by a decrease in their average cost. The average balance of borrowings increased by $68.3 million to $685.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $617.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of borrowings decreased four basis points to 2.10% from 2.14%.\nThe increase in the average balance of borrowings largely reflected a $65.2 million increase in the average balance of FHLB advances to $647.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $582.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of FHLB advances decreased three basis points to 2.21% from 2.24% largely reflecting the Company's greater use of lower-costing, overnight borrowings to temporarily fund a portion of loan growth during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nThe noted increase in the average balance of borrowings also reflected a $3.0 million increase in the average balance of other borrowings, comprised primarily of depositor sweep accounts, to $38.4 million from $35.4 million. The average cost of sweep accounts decreased by 18 basis points to 0.33% from 0.51% between the same comparative periods.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses decreased by $5.3 million to $5.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $10.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was largely attributable to a lower provision on non-impaired\nloans evaluated collectively for impairment coupled with a decrease in specific losses recognized on nonperforming loans individually reviewed for impairment.\nRegarding the provision on non-impaired loans, the noted decrease largely reflected the comparative effects of updates to historical and environmental loss factors between periods. As previously discussed, the changes to historical loss factors generally reflected the impact of a decreased level of net charge offs recognized during the year ended June 30, 2017 on the two-year lookback period used to calculate the Company's historical loss factors coupled with the roll off\u201d of the net charge offs from the same period two years earlier. The Company also updated certain environmental loss factors during the year ended June 30, 2017. Such updates primarily reflected an increase in the level of estimated credit losses attributable to the increased concentration and decreased seasoning in the Company's commercial mortgage loan sectors. To a lesser extent, the net decrease in the provision expense reflected slightly lower growth in the outstanding balance of loans collectively evaluated for impairment during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.\nThe prior discussion regarding the allowance for loan losses also highlighted the impact of the re-segmentation\u201d of the loan portfolio on the Company's environmental loss factors. As noted therein, such loss factors were re-evaluated and re-allocated, where appropriate, to reflect the more granular segmentation of loans in the allowance for loan loss calculation during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Where appropriate, the specific criteria and/or basis upon which the Company derives the environmental loss factors ascribed to loans was also revised or enhanced in conjunction with the segmentation changes noted.\nThe implementation of the segmentation changes within the loan portfolio in the calculation of the allowance for loan loss did not result in a significant change in the required, aggregate balance of the allowance attributable to loans evaluated collectively for impairment. Consequently, the decrease in the provision for loan losses during the year ended June 30, 2017 largely reflected the updates to the historical and environmental loss factors discussed earlier coupled with the lesser effect of a comparatively lower level of growth in the unimpaired portion of the loan portfolio between comparative periods. As noted above, the decrease in provision also reflected a decrease in losses recognized on specific loans individually reviewed for impairment.\nAdditional information regarding the allowance for loan losses and the associated provisions recognized during the year ended June 30, 2017 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 1 and Note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income, excluding gains and losses on the sale securities and gains and losses on the sale and write-down real estate owned, increased by $593,000 to $11.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $10.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was largely attributable to a $1.1 million increase in the gain on sale of loans. The increase in loan sale gains included a $468,000 increase in gains associated with the sale of SBA loans arising from an increase in loans originated and sold. The increase in loan sale gains also included $631,000 in gains on sale of residential mortgage loans reflecting the continued expansion of the Company's mortgage banking business strategy.\nThe noted increases in non-interest income were partially offset by a $356,000 decrease in the income recognized on bank-owned life insurance that largely reflected the continuing effects of lower market interest rates on the yields earned by the Company on its underlying policies. A decrease in fees and service charges also offset a portion of the overall increase in non-interest income. A significant portion of the decrease in fees and service charges reflected a reduction in deposit-related merchant processing fees that was fully offset by a corresponding decrease in merchant processing service provider expenses that partially offset the increase in non-interest expense within the category of equipment and systems expenses. To a lesser extent, the decrease in fees and service charges also reflected decreases in other deposit-related fees and charges, including account overdraft and electronic banking fees and charges, as well as a reduction in loan-related prepayment charges.\nWe also recognized net losses totaling $106,000 arising from the write down and sale of REO during the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to net losses of $137,000 recognized during the earlier comparative period. The decrease in losses relating to the disposal of real estate owned were partially offset by a nominal decrease in gains and losses arising from the sale and call of securities.\nNon-Interest Expenses. Non-interest expense increased by $8.7 million to $81.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $72.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The net increase in non-interest expense primarily reflected increases in salary and employee benefits expense, director compensation expense and miscellaneous expense with lesser increases reflected in premises occupancy expense, equipment and system expense and advertising and market expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in deposit insurance expense.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased by $5.7 million to $47.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $42.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increases in salaries and employee benefits partly reflected the impact of the Company's 2016 Equity Incentive Plan approved by shareholders in October 2016. Based on the original value of the grants at the time they were issued on December 1, 2016, coupled with the five year vesting period, the aggregate pre-tax\u201d and after-tax\u201d expense\nassociated with the noted grants total approximately $6.2 million and $4.3 million per year, respectively, of which approximately $3.6 million and $2.5 million were recognized during the latter seven months of fiscal 2017, respectively. Approximately $2.5 million of such pre-tax\u201d expenses were allocated and reported in salaries and employee benefits with the remaining $1.1 million included in director compensation, as discussed below.\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits also reflected increases in employee compensation costs arising from an incremental increase in the number of FTE employees during the year as well as overall increases in employee health insurance costs. Additionally, retirement plan-related expenses increased due to an increase in the Company's contribution to its employee defined-benefit pension plan as well as an increase in ESOP expense attributable to the increase in the average market price of the Company's shares of capital stock during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.\nThe $1.2 million increase in director compensation expense for fiscal 2017 primarily reflected $1.1 million in allocated expenses attributable to director benefits associated with the Company's 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, as noted above. The remaining portion of the variance reflected an increase in director fees that was primarily attributable to the addition of two independent directors during the prior fiscal year whose full-year\u201d annual compensation expense were fully reflected during fiscal 2017.\nWhile reflecting a variety of increases across a number of general and administrative expenses, the $1.4 million increase in miscellaneous expense for fiscal 2017 largely reflected the noteworthy effect of the Company's recognition of a $931,000 non-recurring recovery of pension plan expense during the prior fiscal year that resulted from amending the terms of its Director Consultation and Retirement Plan (the DCRP ).\nThe increase in premises occupancy expense partly reflected an increase in facility rent expense due to the revised terms of certain facility leases renewed during the period coupled with the additional cost of a new ground lease associated with a forthcoming branch relocation. The increase in premises occupancy expense also reflected an increase in facility repairs and maintenance expenses and real estate tax expenses relating to the Company's branch and administrative facilities.\nThe increase in equipment and systems expense largely reflected the recognition of a non-recurring recovery of certain historical data network charges that reduced technology service provider expenses during the prior fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe increase in advertising and marketing expense were primarily attributable to increased print, electronic media and outdoor advertising costs associated with specific campaigns supporting targeted business strategies focused on expansion of commercial business banking and consumer deposit products, services and relationships.\nFinally, the decrease in deposit insurance expense primarily reflected a reduction in the Bank's FDIC assessment rate that went into effect on July 1, 2016.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by $2.0 million to $8.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $6.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in income tax expense primarily reflected the underlying differences in the level of the taxable portion of pre-tax income between comparative periods.\nOur effective tax rates during the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 were 32.2% and 30.0% which, in relation to statutory income tax rates, reflected the effects of recurring sources of tax-favored income included in pre-tax income as well as the effects of non-recurring tax deductions recognized on the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options by employees.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $15.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share, an increase of $10.2 million compared to $5.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net income was partly attributable to the effect of the non-recurring $10.0 million charitable contribution that was made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering in fiscal 2015. The increase in net income also reflected increases in net interest income and non-interest income that were partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in non-interest expense, excluding the effects of the charitable contribution noted earlier. In total, these factors resulted in an increase in pre-tax net income between comparative periods. The Company recorded income tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2016. However, the effects of the Company's tax-favored income sources, coupled with other reductions in income tax expense, resulted in the Company recording a net income tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2015.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $95.0 million, an increase of $14.4 million from $80.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income between the comparative periods resulted from an increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase in interest expense. As discussed in greater detail below, the\nincrease in interest income was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets augmented by an increase in their average yield. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost. The average yields and average costs between comparative periods continued to reflect the effects of low interest rates that were prevalent in the marketplace throughout most of fiscal 2016.\nAs a result of these factors, our net interest rate spread decreased 14 basis points to 2.06% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.20% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the net interest rate spread reflected a 19 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 1.07% from 0.88% while the yield on earning assets increased by five basis points to 3.13% from 3.08% between those same comparative periods. A discussion of the factors contributing to the overall change in yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities is presented in the separate discussion and analysis of interest income and interest expense below.\nThe factors resulting in the decrease in net interest rate spread also adversely affected our net interest margin. However, the effects of those factors were more than offset by the beneficial impact to net interest income arising from the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets that was attributable to the investment of the net capital proceeds raised in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second step conversion and stock offering in May 2015. Consequently, the Company's net interest margin increased by one basis point to 2.35% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.34% for the year ended June 30, 2015.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $20.8 million to $126.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $106.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. As noted above, the increase in interest income reflected increases in both the average balance and average yield of interest-earning assets. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased by $603.4 million to $4.05 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $3.45 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average yield on interest-earning assets declined five basis points to 3.13% from 3.08%.\nInterest income from loans increased $21.3 million to $98.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $76.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest income on loans was attributable to a net increase in the average balance of loans that was partially offset by a decline in their average yield.\nThe average balance of loans increased by $662.5 million to $2.51 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.85 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. The reported increase in the average balance of loans primarily reflected an aggregate increase of $607.5 million in the average balance of commercial loans to $1.78 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.18 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. Our commercial loans generally comprise commercial mortgage loans, including multi-family and nonresidential mortgage loans, as well as secured and unsecured commercial business loans. The increase in the average balance of commercial loans included the effects of loan purchases funded with a portion of the proceeds raised in the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that closed in May 2015.\nThe increase in the average balance of total loans also reflected a net increase in the average balance of residential mortgage loans which increased by $43.5 million to $706.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $662.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. Our residential mortgages generally comprise one-to four-family first mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average balance of construction loans decreased $2.8 million to $4.2 million from $7.0 million while the average balance of consumer loans increased $10.8 million to $15.5 million from $4.7 million. The increase in the average balance of consumer loans for fiscal 2016 primarily reflected the effects of the loans acquired through the Company's relationship with Lending Club.\nThe effect on interest income attributable to the net increase in the average balance of loans was partially offset by the noted decrease in their average yield. The average yield on loans decreased by 24 basis points to 3.90% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 4.14% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The reduction in the overall yield on our loan portfolio largely reflects the continuing effect of low market interest rates. Specifically, the average yield on the newly originated loans that provided the incremental growth in the portfolio during fiscal 2016 reflected the generally low level of interest rates prevalent in the marketplace during the period which reduced the overall yield of the loan portfolio.\nInterest income from mortgage-backed securities decreased by $1.3 million to $17.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $18.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in interest income reflected a decrease in the average yield of mortgage-backed securities that was partially offset by an increase in their average balance.\nThe average yield on mortgage-backed securities decreased by 32 basis points to 2.33% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.65% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the overall yield of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio largely reflected the comparatively lower yields of securities purchased during fiscal 2016.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average balance of mortgage-backed securities increased by $37.6 million to $741.2 million from $703.6 million. The increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities largely reflects the effects of security purchases that outpaced principal repayments between comparative periods. The increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities included the effects of security purchases funded with a portion of the proceeds raised in the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that closed in May 2015.\nInterest income from debt securities increased by $717,000 to $9.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $9.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest income reflected an increase in the average yield on debt securities that was partially offset by a decrease in their average balance. The average yield on debt securities increased 21 basis points to 1.65% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.44 % for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of debt securities decreased $34.8 million to $602.4 million from $637.2 million.\nThe increase in the average yield on debt securities reflected a 22 basis point increase in the yield on taxable securities to 1.57% during the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.35% during the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the yield on tax-exempt securities increased four basis points to 1.99% from 1.95%.\nThe decrease in the average balance of debt securities was largely attributable to a $43.5 million decrease in the average balance of taxable securities to $492.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $535.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of tax-exempt securities increased by $8.7 million to $110.0 million from $101.3 million.\nInterest income from other interest-earning assets increased by $173,000 to $1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 reflecting an increase in the average yield that was partially offset by a decline in the average balance. The average yield on other interest-earning assets increased by 29 basis points to 0.91% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 0.62% for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of other interest-earning assets decreased by $61.7 million to $194.5 million from $256.2 million.\nThe changes in the average balance and average yield on other interest-earning assets between comparative periods largely reflected the effects of a temporary increase in low-yielding cash and cash equivalents held during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in these short-term liquid assets during that quarter largely reflected the funds received and held during the subscription phase of our second-step conversion and stock offering as well as the excess liquidity held after the closing of the transaction pending their investment into other higher yielding assets during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased by $6.5 million to $31.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $25.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities as well as an increase in their average cost. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $78.5 million to $2.97 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $2.90 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 19 basis points to 1.07% from 0.88%.\nInterest expense attributed to deposits increased by $2.8 million to $18.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $15.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits coupled with an increase in their average cost.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by $18.2 million to $2.36 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $2.34 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For the comparative periods noted, the average balance of certificates of deposit increased by $91.4 million to $1.12 billion from $1.03 billion, while the average balance of savings and club accounts increased $566,000 to $516.4 million from $515.8 million. These increases were partially offset by a $73.8 million decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts to $723.1 million from $797.0 million.\nThe cost of interest-bearing deposits increased by 11 basis points to 0.79% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 0.68% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The net increase in the average cost was partly attributable to a 13 basis points increase in the average cost of certificates of deposit which increased to 1.22% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.09% for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing checking accounts increased nine basis points to 0.59% from 0.50%, while the average cost of savings and club accounts remained stable at 0.16% between those same comparative periods.\nThe decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts and the corresponding increase in their average cost largely reflected the effects of the low-cost funds held in such accounts during the subscription phase of our second step conversion and stock offering in fiscal 2015. Conversely, the increase in the average balance and average cost of certificates of deposits largely reflected the effects of attracting higher-cost, longer-term funding through our retail deposit channels for interest rate risk management purposes.\nInterest expense attributed to borrowings increased by $3.7 million to $13.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $9.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense on borrowings reflected increases in their average balance and average cost. The average balance of borrowings increased by $60.3 million to $617.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $557.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of borrowings increased 44 basis points to 2.14% from 1.70%.\nThe net increase in the average balance of borrowings largely reflected a $55.6 million increase in the average balance of FHLB advances which increased to $582.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $526.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of FHLB advances increased 47 basis points to 2.24% from 1.77%. As noted earlier, the increase in the average balance of FHLB advances primarily reflected an additional short-term advance of $50.0 million drawn during the year ended June 30, 2016 whose cost had been effectively fixed over a five-year period based on a previously executed interest rate swap transaction whose terms became effective during the period.\nThe net increase in the average balance of borrowings also reflected a $4.7 million increase in the average balance of other borrowings, comprised primarily of depositor sweep accounts, to $35.4 million from $30.7 million. The average cost of sweep accounts increased one basis point to 0.51% from 0.50% between comparative periods.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses increased $4.6 million to $10.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $6.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The net increase in the provision primarily reflected updates to historical and environmental loss factors utilized to measure impairment on collectively evaluated loans. The increase in provision expense also reflected the greater growth in such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in provision expense attributable to these factors was partially offset by a net decrease in specific losses recognized on loans evaluated individually for impairment that largely reflected a higher level of recoveries recognized on such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nAdditional information regarding the allowance for loan losses and the associated provisions recognized during the year ended June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 1 and Note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income, excluding gains and losses on the sale of securities and REO, increased by $2.2 million to $10.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $8.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase was partly attributable to an increase in the income arising from our investment in bank-owned life insurance due largely to the growth in the average balance of the cash surrender value of the various policies held by the Company. The Company had also recognized payouts on life insurance policies totaling $1.4 million during the prior year ended June 30, 2015 for which no such payouts were recognized during the year ended June 30, 2016. Absent the effect of these payouts, income from bank owned life insurance increased by approximately $3.0 million reflecting the noted increase in the average balance of the policies less the effects of a decrease in the earnings rate on such policies attributable to the sustained effects of lower long-term market interest rates.\nThe increase in non-interest income also reflected a net increase in fees and service charges that was primarily attributable to an increase in loan prepayment charges. The increase in loan prepayment charges were augmented, to a lesser degree, by a net increase in deposit-related fees and service charges, including ATM and debit card transaction fees separately reported under electronic banking fees and charges.\nThe increase in non-interest income reflected an increase in loan sale gains attributable to a $243,000 increase in SBA loan sale gains reflecting an overall increase in related loan origination and sale activity. The increase in loan sale gains also reflected $82,000 in gains on sale of residential mortgage loans arising from the initial implementation of the Company's mortgage banking business strategy during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nThe noted increases in non-interest income were partially offset by a decrease in miscellaneous income that primarily reflected the recognition of a $370,000 non-recurring adjustment to gain on bargain purchase during the year ended June 30, 2015 relating to the Company's prior acquisition of Atlas Bank.\nThe noted net increase in non-interest income was augmented by a decrease in net losses relating to write downs and sales of real estate owned between comparative periods. The decrease in losses relating to the disposal of real estate owned were partially offset by a nominal decrease in gains arising from the sale and call of securities.\nNon-Interest Expenses. Non-interest expense decreased by $5.7 million to $72.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $78.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. However, non-interest expense for fiscal 2015 included a non-recurring $10.0 million charitable contribution that was made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering. Excluding the effect of that charitable contribution, included in miscellaneous expense during the prior fiscal year, non-interest expense increased by $4.3 million during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nThe increase in non-interest expense, as adjusted, reflected increases in salaries and employee benefits, advertising and marketing, deposit insurance and director compensation expenses that were partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous expense coupled with less noteworthy decreases in premises occupancy expense and equipment and systems expense that generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those categories.\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits expense partly reflected the limited and controlled expansion of the human resources within our various business lines and, where needed, the supporting operating and risk management departments. The incremental increase in expense associated with these new resources was partially defrayed by our efforts to improve overall operating efficiency during fiscal 2016 that resulted in a net decrease in the number of full time equivalent ( FTE\u201d) employees for the year that was achieved largely through reallocation and attrition of resources. The increase in compensation-related expenses also included an increase in the cost of employee healthcare benefits as well as an increase in ESOP expense that was primarily attributable to the increase in the Company's average share price between comparative periods.\nThe noted increase in advertising and marketing expenses was largely attributable to expanded corporate and business line advertising campaigns across the print, electronic media and outdoor advertising formats while the reported increase in deposit insurance expense largely reflected the overall growth in the Company's total assets that serves as a contributing basis to the calculation of FDIC insurance premiums.\nThe increase in non-interest expense also reflected an increase in director compensation expense that was primarily attributable to the addition of two independent directors during fiscal 2016. This increase in director compensation was more than offset by the effect of a non-recurring curtailment gain on pension plan expense totaling $931,000 that was recognized in miscellaneous expense during fiscal 2016. The curtailment gain resulted from the amendment of the Company's Directors Consultation and Retirement Plan (the DCRP\u201d) during the year. The noted amendments froze the DCRP such that no additional DCRP benefits accrue to any participant after December 31, 2015 and revised the minimum age requirement for benefit vesting purposes.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by $8.1 million to income tax expense of $6.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from an income tax benefit of $1.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The provision for both periods reflected the effects of the Company's recurring sources of tax-favored income on taxable net income for each year. Such recurring tax-favored income sources include interest income on municipal obligations and the income arising from periodic increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance.\nHowever, the taxable portion of the Company's net income for fiscal 2015 also reflected the effects of certain non-recurring sources of non-taxable income including a $1.4 million payout on bank-owned life insurance policies. In that regard, we also recognized a non-taxable adjustment to gain on bargain purchase totaling $370,000 during fiscal 2015 relating to the acquisition of Atlas Bank that exceeded the original bargain purchase gain of $226,000 recognized on that transaction during fiscal 2014.\nIn addition to these items, the income tax provision for fiscal 2015 reflected the utilization of a net operating loss carry forward originated by Kearny MHC, our prior mutual holding company, arising from its merger into the Company in conjunction with the second step conversion and stock offering. The value of that carry-forward had not been recognized in prior years resulting in a $354,000 income tax benefit to the Company during fiscal 2015. The income tax provision for fiscal 2015 also reflected a $416,000 income tax benefit arising from the exercise of stock options during the year.\nAfter adjusting for the effects of these recurring and non-recurring factors, the overall increase in the income tax provision largely reflected the underlying differences in the taxable portion of pre-tax income between comparative periods. Our effective income tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2016 was 30.0%, which primarily reflected the effects of recurring sources of tax-favored income. By comparison, our effective income tax rate (benefit) during the year ended June 30, 2015 was (29.1)% which, in relation to statutory income tax rates, reflected the effects of the recurring and non-recurring items noted above.\nAverage Balance Sheet. The following table sets forth certain information relating to Kearny Financial at and for the periods indicated. We derived the average yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented with daily balances used to derive average balances. No tax equivalent adjustments have been made to yield or costs.\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

by cash and cash equivalents, is a product of our operating, investing and financing activities. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization, prepayments and maturities of mortgage-backed securities and outstanding loans, maturities and calls of securities and funds provided from operations. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets, such as overnight deposits, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. While scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage-backed securities and maturing securities and short-term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, general interest rates, economic conditions and competition greatly influence deposit flows and prepayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities.\nKearny Bank is required to have enough investments that qualify as liquid assets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe operation. Liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans. We attempt to maintain adequate but not excessive liquidity and liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management.\nCash and cash equivalents, consisting primarily of deposits in other banks, decreased $121.0 million to $78.2 million at June 30, 2017 from $199.2 million at June 30, 2016. The balance of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 reflected a temporary accumulation of short-term, liquid assets arising from an increase in loan prepayments during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The Company reinvested a significant portion of that excess liquidity back into the loan portfolio during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe balance of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2017 included funds on deposit at other institutions totaling $62.5 million and other cash-related items, consisting primarily of vault cash and cash held by, or in transit to/from, our cash repository service provider, totaling $15.7 million. Cash and equivalents on deposit at other institutions at June 30, 2017 included $4.8 million held by the FHLB, $53.6 million held by the FRB as well as $4.1 million held at three U.S. domestic money center banks representing funds on deposit totaling $2.3 million, $1.0 million and $824,000, respectively, at June 30, 2017.\nManagement reviews cash flow projections regularly and updates them monthly in order to maintain liquid assets at levels believed to meet the requirements of normal operations, including loan commitments and potential deposit outflows from maturing certificates of deposit and other deposit withdrawals. At June 30, 2017, Kearny Bank had commitments to originate and purchase loans totaling $95.2 million compared to $35.6 million at June 30, 2016. As of those same comparative dates, construction loans in process and unused lines of credit were $8.1 and $60.7 million, respectively, compared to $73,000 and $55.4 million, respectively. Kearny Bank had $610.8 million of certificates of deposit maturing in one year at June 30, 2017 compared to $666.1 million at June 30, 2016.\nDeposits increased $235.3 million to $2.93 billion at June 30, 2017 from $2.69 billion at June 30, 2016. Between those comparative periods, non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased $28.7 million to $267.4 million, interest-bearing demand deposits increased $115.0 million to $847.7 million, savings and club deposits increased $8.0 million to $524.0 million while certificates of deposit increased $83.6 million to $1.29 billion.\nBorrowings from the FHLB of New York and other sources are generally available to supplement Kearny Bank's liquidity position and to the extent that maturing deposits do not remain with us, management may replace the funds with such borrowings. Kearny Bank has the capacity to borrow additional funds from the FHLB by taking additional long-term or short-term advances including overnight borrowings. As of June 30, 2017, Kearny Bank's borrowing potential was $882.1 million without pledging additional collateral.\nThe following table sets forth information concerning balances and interest rates on

outstanding commitments to originate loans held for sale totaling $18.4 million at June 30, 2017. Origination commitments on loans held for sale whose terms include interest rate locks to borrowers are generally paired with a non-binding\u201d best-efforts commitment to sell the loan to a buyer at a fixed price and within a predetermined timeframe after the sale commitment is established.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of our business of investing in loans and securities as well as in the normal course of maintaining and improving Kearny Bank's facilities. These financial instruments include significant purchase commitments, such as commitments related to capital expenditure plans and commitments to purchase securities or mortgage-backed securities and commitments to extend credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. We had no significant off-balance sheet commitments to purchase securities as of June 30, 2017.\nIn addition to the commitments noted above, Kearny Bank is party to standby letters of credit totaling approximately $715,000 at June 30, 2017 through which we guarantee certain specific business obligations of our commercial customers.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nAt June 30, 2017, outstanding loan commitments relating to loans held in portfolio totaled $163.9 million compared to $91.0 million at June 30, 2016. As of that same date, the Company also had outstanding commitments to originate loans held for sale totaling $18.4 million that are considered derivative instruments whose values are not considered to be material for financial statement reporting purposes. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. For additional information regarding our outstanding lending commitments at June 30, 2017, see Note 14 and Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nCapital\nConsistent with our goals to operate as a sound and profitable financial organization, Kearny Financial and Kearny Bank actively seek to maintain our well capitalized status in accordance with regulatory standards. As of June 30, 2017, Kearny Financial and Kearny Bank exceeded all capital requirements of the federal banking regulators and were considered well capitalized\u201d.\nKearny Bank's regulatory capital ratios at June 30, 2017 were as follows: Tier 1 leverage ratio 15.47%; Common Equity Tier I risk-based capital 22.39%; Tier I risk-based capital 22.39%; and total risk-based capital 23.30%.\nKearny Financial's regulatory capital ratios at June 30, 2017 were as follows: Tier 1 leverage ratio 20.11%; Common Equity Tier I risk-based capital 29.08%; Tier I risk-based capital 29.08%; and total risk-based capital 29.98%.\nThe regulatory capital requirements to be considered well capitalized at June 30, 2017 were as follows: Tier 1 leverage ratio 5.0%; Common Equity Tier I risk-based capital 6.5%; Tier I risk-based capital 8.0%; and total risk-based capital 10.0%.\nFor additional information regarding regulatory capital at June 30, 2017, see Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe financial statements included in this document have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.\nOur primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates, however, do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation. In a period of rapidly rising interest rates, the liquidity and maturities of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels.\nThe principal effect of inflation on earnings, as distinct from levels of interest rates, is in the area of non-interest expense. Expense items such as employee compensation, employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation. An additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in the dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made. We are unable to determine the extent, if any, to which properties securing our loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of the expected impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements that have yet to be adopted by us, please refer to Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThis discussion and analysis reflects Kearny Financial Corp.'s consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data, and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding Kearny Financial Corp. and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nFinancial Condition. Total assets increased $318.1 million to $4.82 billion at June 30, 2017 from $4.50 billion at June 30, 2016. The increase in total assets reflected an increase in net loans receivable that was partially offset by decreases in securities and cash and cash equivalents. The increase in total assets was largely funded by increases in deposits and borrowings that were partially offset by a decrease in stockholders' equity. The decrease in stockholders' equity primarily reflected the Company's share repurchases that outpaced the accretion from earnings during the year.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2017, loans receivable, excluding loans held for sale, increased by $571.3 million to $3.25 billion, or 72.8% of earning assets, at June 30, 2017 from $2.67 billion, or 64.6% of earning assets, at June 30, 2016. The growth in loans during fiscal 2017 continued to reflect our strategic emphasis in growing our commercial loan portfolio, including multi-family loans, nonresidential mortgage loans and commercial business loans. The increase in commercial mortgage and commercial business loans during fiscal 2017 totaled $622.9 million, or 32.0%, to $2.57 billion, or 79.3% of total loans at June 30, 2017, from $1.95 billion, or 73.0% of total loans, at June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, one- to four-family mortgage loans, including first mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, decreased by $44.6 million to $650.1 million, or 20.1% of total loans, from $694.8 million, or 26.0% of total loans.\nFor those same comparative periods, total securities decreased by $146.1 million to $1.11 billion, or 24.9% of earning assets, at June 30, 2017 from $1.26 billion, or 30.3% of earning assets, at June 30, 2016. We generally maintained the overall composition of our securities portfolio during fiscal 2017 while adding subordinated debt as an eligible non-mortgage-backed security sector within the portfolio. However, for interest rate risk management purposes, security balances were modestly reallocated during fiscal 2017 to increase investment in shorter duration, floating-rate sectors within the non-mortgage-backed securities portfolio while investment in comparatively longer duration, fixed-rate securities in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio declined. Non-mortgage-backed securities, including U.S. agency debentures, corporate bonds, single-issuer trust preferred securities, collateralized loan obligations, municipal obligations, subordinated debt, and asset-backed securities, increased by $32.2 million to $589.2 million, or 53.2% of securities, at June 30, 2017 from $557.1 million, or 44.5% of securities, at June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the balance of mortgage-backed securities, primarily comprising U.S. government and agency pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, decreased by $175.9 million to $517.9 million, or 46.8% of securities, from $693.7 million, or 55.5% of securities.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2017, our total deposits increased by $235.3 million to $2.93 billion from $2.69 billion at June 30, 2016. The net increase in deposits reflected a $151.7 million increase in the balance of non-maturity deposits, including a $28.7 million increase in the balance of non-interest-bearing accounts, coupled with an $83.6 million increase in certificates of deposit.\nThe balance of borrowings increased by $191.8 million to $806.2 million at June 30, 2017 from $614.4 million at June 30, 2016. The increase in borrowings was primarily attributable to a $196.9 million net increase in FHLB advances representing new advances drawn to fund a portion of the loan growth reported during fiscal 2017 that were partially offset by the balance of advances repaid during the year. Interest rate derivatives were used to effectively extend duration of the new borrowings drawn for interest rate risk management purposes. The increase in borrowings was partially offset by a $5.1 million decrease in the balance of overnight borrowings in the form of depositor sweep accounts.\nStockholders' equity decreased by $90.4 million to $1.06 billion at June 30, 2017 from $1.15 billion at June 30, 2016. The decrease in stockholders' equity largely reflected the impact of the Company's share repurchases during fiscal 2017. For the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company repurchased a total of 8,886,627 shares, at a total cost of $126.0 million, or an average cost of 14.18 per share. The noted decrease in stockholders' equity was partially offset by net income of $18.6 million, from which cash dividends of $8.4 million were declared and payable to shareholders during fiscal 2017. The change in stockholders' equity also reflected a $17.8 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income arising from changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities and derivatives portfolios and a $1.9 million decrease in unearned ESOP reflecting the effects of shares earned by plan participants during the year.\nResults of Operations. Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities.\nIt is a function of the average balances of loans and investments versus deposits and borrowed funds outstanding in any one period and the yields earned on those loans and investments and the cost of those deposits and borrowed funds. Our results of operations are also affected by our provision for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense.\nNet income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 was $18.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share; an increase of $2.8 million from $15.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.\nOur net interest income increased $7.6 million to $102.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $95.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected a $12.2 million increase in interest income to $139.1 million from $126.9 million. The increase in interest income primarily reflected an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets coupled with an increase in their average yield. For the year ended June 30, 2017, the average balance of interest-earning assets increased by $200.6 million to $4.25 billion compared to $4.05 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average yield on interest-earning assets increased by 14 basis points to 3.27% from 3.13%.\nThe increase in interest income for the year ended June 30, 2017 was partially offset by a $4.6 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest expense between the two periods reflected an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost. For the year ended June 30, 2017 the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $244.2 million to $3.22 billion compared to $2.97 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased six basis points to 1.13% from 1.07%.\nThe net interest rate spread increased eight basis points to 2.14% for fiscal 2017 from 2.06% for fiscal 2016 while the net interest margin increased six basis points to 2.41% from 2.35% for those same comparative periods.\nThe provision for loan losses decreased $5.3 million to $5.4 million for fiscal 2017 from $10.7 million for fiscal 2016. The decrease in provision expense partly reflected a net decrease in specific losses recognized on loans evaluated individually for impairment. This decrease was primarily reflected in the lower level of net charge offs recognized on such loans between comparative periods. The decrease in net charge offs also contributed to a decrease in the historical loss factors utilized to measure impairment on collectively evaluated loans. Taken together with the updates to environmental loss factors, the provision expense for loans collectively evaluated for impairment decreased year-over-year. To a lesser extent, the net decrease in the provision expense reflected slightly lower growth in the outstanding balance of loans collectively evaluated for impairment during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.\nNon-interest income increased $621,000 to $11.3 million for fiscal 2017 from $10.7 million for fiscal 2016. The increase was largely attributable to an increase in loan sale gains that partly reflected an increase in the volume of residential mortgage loans originated and sold as the Company continued to expand its mortgage banking business line throughout fiscal 2017. The increase in loan sale gains also reflected an increase in the volume of SBA loans originated and sold. The noted increase in non-interest income was partially offset by a decrease in income arising from our investment in bank-owned life insurance due largely to the lingering effects of lower market interest rates on the income earned on the cash surrender value of the various policies held by the Company. The increase in non-interest income was also partially offset by a decrease in fees and service charges that was largely attributable to a decrease in deposit-related service charges coupled with a lesser decrease in loan prepayment charges.\nNon-interest expense increased by $8.7 million to $81.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $72.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was reflected across most categories of non-interest expense with the most noteworthy increases reflected in salaries and employee benefits, director compensation and miscellaneous expenses.\nAs described in greater detail below, the increases in salaries and employee benefits and director compensation expense each reflected the impact of the Company's 2016 Equity Incentive Plan approved by shareholders in October 2016. The increase in salaries and employee benefits also reflected increases in employee compensation costs arising from an increase in the number of employees during the year as well as increases in health insurance and retirement-related employee benefit plans.\nIn addition to reflecting the noted impact of the costs associated with the Company's 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, the increase in director compensation expense also reflected an increase in director fees attributable to the addition of two independent directors during the prior fiscal year whose full-year\u201d annual compensation expense were fully reflected during fiscal 2017.\nWhile reflecting a variety of increases across a number of general and administrative expenses, the increase in miscellaneous expense for fiscal 2017 reflected the effect of the Company's recognition of a non-recurring recovery of director pension plan expense during the prior fiscal year.\nFinally, the noted increases in non-interest expense were partially offset by a decrease in deposit insurance expense that largely reflected a decrease in the assessment rate charged by the FDIC during fiscal 2017.\nThe combined effects of the factors highlighted above resulted in a $4.8 million increase in pre-tax net income and a corresponding $2.0 million increase in income tax expense during fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. We describe them in detail in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included as an exhibit to this document. In preparing the audited consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of financial condition and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the evaluation of securities impairment and the impairment testing of goodwill.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects our estimation of the losses in our loan portfolio to the extent they are both probable and reasonable to estimate. The balance of the allowance is generally maintained through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income in the period that estimated losses on loans are identified by our loan review system. We charge losses on loans against the allowance as such losses are actually incurred. Recoveries on loans previously charged-off are added back to the allowance.\nAs described in greater detail in the notes to audited consolidated financial statements, our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology utilizes a two-tier\u201d loss measurement process that is generally performed monthly. Through the first tier of the process, we identify the loans that must be reviewed individually for impairment. Such loans generally include our larger and/or more complex loans including commercial mortgage loans, comprising multi-family and nonresidential real estate loans, construction loans and commercial business loans as well as our one- to four-family mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. A reviewed loan is deemed to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Once a loan is determined to be impaired, management measures the amount of the estimated impairment associated with that loan which is generally defined as the amount by which the carrying value of a loan exceeds its fair value. We establish valuation allowances for loan impairments in the fiscal period during which they are identified. Impairments on individually evaluated loans generally are charged off against the applicable valuation allowance when they are determined to be confirmed, expected losses.\nThe second tier of the loss measurement process involves estimating the probable and estimable losses on loans not otherwise individually reviewed for impairment. Such loans generally comprise large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans as well as the remaining non-impaired loans of those types noted above that are otherwise eligible for individual impairment evaluation.\nValuation allowances established through the second tier of the loss measurement process utilize historical and environmental loss factors to collectively estimate the level of probable losses within defined segments of our loan portfolio. To calculate the historical loss factors, our allowance for loan loss methodology generally utilizes a two-year moving average of annualized net charge-off rates (charge-offs net of recoveries) by loan segment, where available, to calculate the actual, historical loss experience. The outstanding principal balance of each loan segment is multiplied by the applicable historical loss factor to estimate the level of probable losses based upon our historical loss experience.\nEnvironmental loss factors are based upon specific quantitative and qualitative criteria representing key sources of risk within the loan portfolio. Such sources of risk include those relating to the level of and trends in nonperforming loans; the level of and trends in credit risk management effectiveness, the levels and trends in lending resource capability; levels and trends in economic and market conditions; levels and trends in loan concentrations; levels and trends in loan composition and terms, levels and trends in independent loan review effectiveness, levels and trends in collateral values and the effects of other external factors. The outstanding principal balance of each loan segment is multiplied by the applicable environmental loss factors to estimate the level of probable losses based upon their supporting quantitative and qualitative criteria.\nThe sum of the probable and estimable loan losses calculated in accordance with loss measurement processes, as described above, represents the total targeted balance for our allowance for loan losses at the end of a fiscal period. A more detailed discussion of our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology is presented in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment Testing of Goodwill. We record goodwill, representing the excess of amounts paid over the fair value of net assets of the institutions acquired in purchase transactions, at its fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested and deemed impaired when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Goodwill was most recently tested as of June 30, 2017, at which\ntime no impairment was indicated. As of that date, we reported goodwill of $108.6 million. The value of the goodwill can change in the future. We expect the value of the goodwill to decrease if there is a significant decrease in the franchise value of Kearny Bank. If an impairment is determined in the future, we will reflect the loss as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined, leading to a reduction of our net income for that period by the amount of the impairment.\nOther-than-Temporary Impairment ( OTTI\u201d) of Securities. If the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost, the security is deemed to be impaired. Management evaluates all securities with unrealized losses quarterly to determine if such impairments are temporary\u201d or other-than-temporary\u201d in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.\nWe account for temporary impairments based upon the classification of the related security as either available for sale, held to maturity or trading. Temporary impairments on available for sale\u201d securities are recognized, on a tax-effected basis, through accumulated other comprehensive income with offsetting entries adjusting the carrying value of the security and the balance of deferred taxes. Conversely, we do not adjust the carrying value of held to maturity\u201d securities for temporary impairments, although information concerning the amount and duration of impairments on held to maturity securities is generally disclosed in periodic financial statements. The carrying value of securities held in a trading portfolio is adjusted to their fair value through earnings on a daily basis. However, we maintained no securities in trading portfolios at or during the periods presented in these financial statements.\nWe account for OTTI based upon several considerations. First, OTTI on securities that we have decided to sell as of the close of a fiscal period, or will, more likely than not, be required to sell prior to the full recovery of their fair value to a level equal to or exceeding their amortized cost, are recognized in earnings. If neither of these conditions regarding the likelihood of the security's sale is applicable, then the OTTI is bifurcated into credit-related and noncredit-related components. A credit-related impairment generally represents the amount by which the present value of the cash flows that are expected to be collected on an other-than-temporarily impaired security fall below its amortized cost. The noncredit-related component represents the remaining portion of the impairment not otherwise designated as credit-related. We recognize credit-related, OTTI in earnings. However, noncredit-related, other-than-temporary impairments on debt securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nComparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016\nGeneral. Total assets increased $318.1 million to $4.82 billion at June 30, 2017 from $4.50 billion at June 30, 2016. The net increase in total assets primarily reflected an increase in net loans receivable that was partially offset by decreases in balances of securities and cash and cash equivalents. The net increase in total assets was largely funded by increases in deposits and borrowings that were partially offset by a net decrease in stockholders' equity.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents, which consist primarily of interest-earning and non-interest-earning deposits in other banks, decreased by $121.0 million to $78.2 million at June 30, 2017 from $199.2 million at June 30, 2016. The balance of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 reflected the effects of temporary accumulation of short-term, liquid assets arising from an increase in loan prepayments during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The average balance of cash and equivalents decreased steadily in fiscal 2017 reflecting the Company's ongoing effort to enhance earnings by generally reducing the level of lower-yielding, short-term liquid assets to the amount needed to fund the Company's strategic initiatives while meeting its performance and risk management objectives.\nDebt Securities Available for Sale. Debt securities classified as available for sale increased by $54.6 million to $444.5 million at June 30, 2017 from $389.9 million at June 30, 2016. The net increase in the portfolio partly reflected security purchases totaling $138.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 coupled with a $10.8 million decrease in the net unrealized loss of the portfolio to a net unrealized loss of $1.4 million at June 30, 2017 from a net unrealized loss of $12.2 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease in the net unrealized loss reflected changes in the fair value of various sectors within the portfolio arising from movements in market interest rates coupled with a tightening of pricing spreads within certain sectors in the portfolio. The noted increases in the portfolio were partially offset by principal repayments, net of premium amortization and discount accretion, totaling $94.6 million during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nThe net unrealized loss on debt securities available for sale was primarily reflected within the applicable credit sectors\u201d of the portfolio which include asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, corporate bonds and non-pooled trust preferred securities. The net unrealized loss on this subset of securities decreased by $11.6 million to a net unrealized loss of $1.7 million at June 30, 2017 from a net unrealized loss of $13.3 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease in the unrealized loss largely reflected a general tightening of pricing spreads in the marketplace resulting in an overall increase in the market price of such securities. The decrease in the net unrealized loss on the noted securities was partially offset by a $755,000 decline in the fair value of government and agency securities, including U.S. agency debentures and municipal obligations, to an unrealized loss of $287,000 at June 30, 2017 from an unrealized gain of $1.0 million at June 30, 2016.\nBased on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of June 30, 2017. However, volatility in the financial markets may result in additional decreases in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities. Such volatility may impact the fair value of the securities within the credit sectors\u201d of the portfolio more adversely than the Company's government and agency securities. The adverse effects of such volatility on the current and prospective financial strength of specific corporate issuers, and the resulting impact on the fair value of the related securities held by the Company, will be carefully monitored by management.\nMortgage-backed Securities Available for Sale. Mortgage-backed securities available for sale decreased by $114.3 million to $169.3 million at June 30, 2017 from $283.6 million at June 30, 2016. The net decrease partly reflected security sales totaling $83.4 million coupled with cash repayment of principal, net of discount accretion and premium amortization, totaling $53.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2017 while also reflecting a $8.5 million decrease in the fair value of the portfolio to a net unrealized loss of $986,000 at June 30, 2017 from a net unrealized gain of $7.5 million at June 30, 2016. These decreases in the portfolio were partially offset by security purchases totaling $30.7 million during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nAt June 30, 2017, the available for sale mortgage-backed securities portfolio primarily included agency pass-through securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nAdditional information regarding securities available for sale at June 30, 2017 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 4 and Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nDebt Securities Held to Maturity. Debt securities classified as held to maturity decreased by $22.5 million to $144.7 million at June 30, 2017 from $167.2 million at June 30, 2016. The net decrease in the portfolio largely reflected principal repayments, net of premium amortization and discount accretion, totaling $56.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2017. The net decrease was partially offset by debt security purchases totaling $34.4 million during the same period. Such purchases included the purchase of $15.0 million in subordinated debt issued by a New Jersey-based community bank through a privately negotiated transaction during the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nAt June 30, 2017, the held to maturity debt securities portfolio also included U.S. agency debentures and municipal obligations, a small portion of which represent non-rated, short term, bond anticipation notes ( BANs\u201d) issued by New Jersey municipalities. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nMortgage-backed Securities Held to Maturity. Mortgage-backed securities held to maturity decreased by $61.5 million to $348.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $410.1 million at June 30, 2016. The net decrease in the portfolio partly reflected security sales totaling $5.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2017, coupled with cash repayment of principal, net of discount accretion and premium amortization, totaling $56.4 million. The securities sold were limited to those whose remaining outstanding balances had declined to the required thresholds, in relation to the original amount purchased or acquired, that allowed their sale from the held to maturity portfolio.\nAt June 30, 2017, the held to maturity mortgage-backed securities portfolio primarily included agency pass-through securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations. As of that date, we also held three non-agency mortgage-backed securities in the held to maturity portfolio whose aggregate carrying values and fair values both totaled $22,000. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nAdditional information regarding securities available for sale at June 30, 2017 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 4 and Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nLoans Held-for-Sale. The Company continues to expand its residential lending infrastructure to support strategies focused on increasing the origination volume of residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. The increase in residential mortgage loan origination and sale activity has increased the Company's level of non-interest income through the recognition of additional sources of recurring loan sale gains while serving to help manage the Company's exposure to interest rate risk. During the year ended June 30, 2017, we sold $84.4 million of residential mortgage loans resulting in net sale gains totaling $713,000 for fiscal 2017. Loans held for sale totaled $4.7 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $3.3 million at June 30, 2016 and are reported separately from the balance of net loans receivable as of those dates.\nLoans Receivable. Loans receivable, net of unamortized premiums, deferred costs and the allowance for loan losses, increased by $566.2 million, or 21.4%, to $3.22 billion at June 30, 2017 from $2.65 billion at June 30, 2016. The increase in net loans receivable\nwas primarily attributable to new loan origination and purchase volume outpacing loan repayments during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nResidential mortgage loans held in portfolio, including home equity loans and lines of credit, decreased by $44.7 million to $650.1 million at June 30, 2017 from $694.8 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the balance of one- to four-family first mortgage loans of $37.9 million to $567.3 million at June 30, 2017 from $605.2 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease also reflected an aggregate decrease of $6.8 million in the balance of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit to $82.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $89.6 million at June 30, 2016.\nNotwithstanding the decrease in their balance during the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company may modestly increase the outstanding balance of residential mortgage loans held in portfolio in the future while allowing the segment to continue to decline as a percentage of total loans and earning assets. In total, the origination volume of portfolio residential mortgage loans for the year ended June 30, 2017 totaled $67.9 million while aggregate originations of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit totaled $18.5 million for that same period.\nCommercial loans, in aggregate, increased by $622.9 million to $2.57 billion at June 30, 2017 from $1.95 billion at June 30, 2016. The components of the aggregate increase included an increase in commercial mortgage loans totaling $636.7 million that was partially offset by a $13.7 million decrease in commercial business loans. The ending balances of commercial mortgage loans and commercial business loans at June 30, 2017 were $2.50 billion and $74.5 million, respectively.\nCommercial loan origination volume for the year ended June 30, 2017 totaled $761.5 million, comprised of $727.4 million and $34.1 million of commercial mortgage and commercial business loan originations, respectively. Commercial loan originations were augmented with the purchase of commercial mortgage loans and participations totaling $126.7 million coupled with the purchase of commercial business loans totaling $17.0 million during the year ended June 30, 2017. Commercial mortgage loan purchases were funded during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with the excess liquidity that had accumulated during the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe outstanding balance of construction loans, net of loans-in-process, increased by $1.8 million to $3.8 million at June 30, 2017 from $2.0 million at June 30, 2016. Construction loan disbursements for the year ended June 30, 2017 totaled $3.0 million.\nOther loans, primarily account loans, deposit account overdraft lines of credit and other consumer loans, decreased by $9.0 million to $16.4 million at June 30, 2017 from $25.4 million at June 30, 2016. The balance of other consumer loans at June 30, 2017 included loans with outstanding balances totaling $12.8 million that were acquired through the Company's relationship with Lending Club, an established peer-to-peer (i.e. marketplace) lender. Through this relationship, the Company has purchased high-quality, unsecured consumer loans originated through Lending Club's online platform. The Company limited its original investment in the Lending Club loan portfolio to an initial threshold of approximately $25.0 million in aggregate outstanding balances and continues to independently monitor and validate the performance of the portfolio in relation to Company's expectations as well as those of Lending Club's proprietary credit risk model. Additional investment in Lending Club loans up to this initial threshold may be considered by the Company while it continues to monitor and assess the performance of the portfolio and quality of loan servicing and reporting rendered by Lending Club.\nThe Company originated $1.8 million of consumer loans during the year ended June 30, 2017 while no additional consumer loans were purchased during the period.\nNonperforming Loans. Nonperforming loans decreased by $2.2 million to $18.9 million, or 0.58% of total loans at June 30, 2017, from $21.1 million, or 0.79% of total loans at June 30, 2016. Nonperforming loans generally include loans reported as accruing loans over 90 days past due\u201d and loans reported as nonaccrual\u201d with such balances totaling $74,000 and $18.8 million, respectively, at June 30, 2017.\nAdditional information about the Company's nonperforming loans at June 30, 2017 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. During the year ended June 30, 2017, the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased by $5.1 million to $29.3 million or 0.90% of total loans at June 30, 2017 from $24.2 million or 0.91% of total loans at June 30, 2016. The increase resulted from provisions of $5.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2017 that were partially offset by charge-offs, net of recoveries, totaling $324,000 during that same period.\nAdditional information about the allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2017 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K as well as in Note 1 and Note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nOther Assets. The aggregate balance of other assets, including premises and equipment, FHLB stock, interest receivable, goodwill, bank owned life insurance, deferred income taxes and other miscellaneous assets, increased by $15.1 million to $412.1 million at June 30, 2017 from $397.0 million at June 30, 2016.\nThe increase in other assets partly reflected an increase in the fair value of the Company's interest rate derivatives portfolio to a net asset value of $7.8 million, included in other assets at June 30, 2017, compared to a net liability value of $19.3 million, included in other liabilities at June 30, 2016. The increase in other assets also included a $9.3 million increase in FHLB stock resulting from an increase in short-term advances drawn during the year ended June 30, 2017 coupled with a $5.2 million increase in the cash surrender value of the Company's bank-owned life insurance policies for the same period. The noted increases in other assets were partially offset by a $10.5 million decrease in deferred income tax assets arising primarily from changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities and derivatives portfolios.\nThe noted increases in other assets included a $806,000 increase in the balance of real estate owned ( REO\u201d) to $1.6 million representing the carrying value of four properties at June 30, 2017, from $826,000, representing the carrying value of three properties at June 30, 2016.\nThe remaining increases and decreases in other assets for the year ended June 30, 2017 generally comprised normal operating fluctuations in their respective balances.\nDeposits. Total deposits increased by $235.3 million to $2.93 billion at June 30, 2017 from $2.69 billion at June 30, 2016. The increase in deposit balances reflected a $206.6 million increase in interest-bearing deposits coupled with a $28.7 million increase in non-interest-bearing deposits. The increase in interest-bearing deposits included an increase in the balance of interest-bearing checking accounts totaling $115.0 million as well as increases in balances of certificates of deposit and savings and club accounts totaling $83.6 million and $8.0 million, respectively.\nThe noted increase in non-interest-bearing deposits partly reflected fluctuating balances within certain large commercial deposit accounts. Notwithstanding these day-to-day fluctuations, the average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits has increased by $24.3 million to $249.7 million compared to $225.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe change in deposit balances for the period reflected changes in the balances of retail deposits as well as non-retail\u201d deposits acquired through various wholesale channels. The $115.0 million increase in the balance of interest-bearing checking accounts primarily reflected an increase in the balance of retail accounts while the balance of brokered money market deposits acquired through Promontory IND program totaled $222.6 million, or 7.6% of total deposits at June 30, 2017, compared to $224.1 million, or 8.3% of total deposits at June 30, 2016. The terms of the IND program generally establish a reciprocal commitment for Promontory to deliver and for us to accept such deposits for a period of no less than five years during which time total aggregate balances shall be maintained within a range of $200.0 million to $230.0 million. Such deposits are generally sourced by Promontory from large retail and institutional brokerage firms whose individual clients seek to have a portion of their investments held in interest-bearing accounts at FDIC-insured institutions.\nWe continued to utilize a deposit listing service through which we attract non-brokered\u201d wholesale time deposits targeting institutional investors with an original investment horizon of two-to-five years. We generally prohibit the withdrawal of our listing service deposits prior to maturity. The balance of the Bank's listing service time deposits increased to $101.4 million, or 3.5% of total deposits at June 30, 2017, compared to $89.9 million, or 3.3% of total deposits at June 30, 2016.\nWe also maintain a small portfolio of longer-term, brokered certificates of deposit whose balances increased by approximately $13.2 million to $21.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $8.4 million at June 30, 2016. In combination with our Promontory IND money market deposits, our brokered deposits totaled $244.2 million, or 8.3% of deposits at June 30, 2017 compared to $232.5 million, or 8.6% of deposits at June 30, 2016.\nBorrowings. The balance of borrowings increased by $191.8 million to $806.2 million at June 30, 2017 from $614.4 million at June 30, 2016. The increase in borrowings primarily reflected an additional $200.0 million of short-term FHLB advances drawn to fund a portion of our growth in loans during fiscal 2017. We utilized interest rate derivatives to effectively swap the rolling 90-day maturity/repricing characteristics of these new borrowings into fixed rates for longer terms. Of the $200.0 million of new advances, $150.0 million were swapped to fixed rate for four years while the remaining $50.0 million were swapped to a fixed rate for five years.\nThe increase in short-term FHLB advances was partially offset by the repayment of a $3.0 million FHLB term advance that matured during the period coupled with principal payments that reduced the outstanding balance of one amortizing advance. Additionally, the net change in borrowings reflected a $5.1 million decrease in outstanding overnight sweep account\u201d balances linked\nto customer demand deposits that generally reflected internal transfers to interest-bearing checking accounts as well as normal operating fluctuations in such balances.\nOther Liabilities. The balance of other liabilities, including advance payments by borrowers for taxes and other miscellaneous liabilities, decreased by $18.6 million to $24.6 million at June 30, 2017 from $43.2 million at June 30, 2016. As noted earlier, the decrease primarily reflected changes in the fair value of the Company's derivatives coupled with normal operating fluctuations in the balances of other liabilities.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company executed a total of seven interest rate derivative transactions with an aggregate notional value of $640.0 million. Five of the transactions, totaling $440.0 million, represent interest rate swaps with a forward\u201d effective date that corresponds to the expiration date of one or more existing derivatives with the same aggregate notional value. As such, each of these five new derivatives effectively extends the interest rate risk protection provided by one or more existing derivatives that currently serve as cash flow hedges against existing sources of wholesale funding. The remaining two derivative transactions were those extending the effective duration of the new advances drawn during the year ended June 30, 2017, as discussed above.\nStockholders' Equity. Stockholders' equity decreased by $90.4 million to $1.06 billion at June 30, 2017 from $1.15 billion at June 30, 2016. The decrease in stockholders' equity largely reflected the impact of the Company's share repurchases during fiscal 2017. In May 2017, the Company announced the completion of its first share repurchase program, originally announced in May 2016, through which it repurchased a total of 9,352,809 shares, or 10%, of its outstanding shares at a total cost of $130.6 million and an average cost of $13.96 per share. Concurrently, the Company announced its second share repurchase program through which it intends to repurchase a total of 8,559,084 shares, or 10%, of its outstanding shares. Through June 30, 2017, the Company has repurchased 1,240,000 shares, or 14.5% of the shares to be repurchased under its second share repurchase plan, at a total cost of $17.7 million and at an average cost of $14.30 per share. Cumulatively for the year ended June 30, 2017, the Company repurchased a total of 8,886,627 shares, at a total cost of $126.0 million, or an average cost of 14.18 per share. The cumulative cost of the Company's repurchased shares has directly reduced the balance of stockholders' equity at June 30, 2017.\nThe net decrease in stockholders' equity was partially offset by net income of $18.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2017, from which cash dividends of $8.4 million were declared and payable to shareholders during the period. The change in stockholders' equity also reflected a $17.8 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, due primarily to changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities portfolio and outstanding derivatives, and a $1.9 million reduction of unearned ESOP shares for plan shares earned by plan participants during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nAt June 30, 2017, the Company had 84,350,848 shares outstanding, comprising 93,528,092 shares originally issued, plus 1,415,565 net shares issued and cancelled relating to stock benefit plan obligations less 10,592,809 cumulative shares repurchased and cancelled through that date.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended June 30, 2017 was $18.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share, an increase of $2.8 million from $15.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in net income reflected increases in net interest income and non-interest income coupled with a decrease in the provision for loan losses that were partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense. These factors contributed to an overall increase in pre-tax net income and a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2017 was $102.6 million; an increase of $7.6 million from $95.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in net interest income between the comparative periods resulted from an increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets coupled with an increase in their average yield. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost.\nAs a result of these factors, our net interest rate spread increased eight basis points to 2.14% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 2.06% for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in the net interest rate spread reflected a 14 basis points increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets to 3.27% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 3.13% for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by six basis points to 1.13% from 1.07%. A discussion of the factors contributing to changes in the average yield and average cost of categories within interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, is presented in the separate discussion and analysis of interest income and interest expense below.\nThe factors resulting in the reported increase in our net interest rate spread also affected our net interest margin. In total, the Company's net interest margin increased six basis points to 2.41% for the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to 2.35% for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $12.2 million to $139.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $126.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. As noted above, the increase in interest income partly reflected a $200.6 million increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $4.25 billion for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $4.05 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the yield on earning assets increased by 14 basis points to 3.27% from 3.13%.\nInterest income from loans increased $13.2 million to $111.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $98.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in interest income on loans was attributable to a net increase in the average balance of loans that was partially offset by a decline in their average yield.\nThe average balance of loans increased by $443.5 million to $2.96 billion for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $2.51 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. The reported increase in the average balance of loans primarily reflected an aggregate increase of $483.7 million in the average balance of commercial loans to $2.27 billion for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $1.78 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average balance of other loans, primarily comprising unsecured consumer term loans, account loans and deposit account overdraft lines of credit, increased by $5.1 million to $20.6 million from $15.5 million. The increase in the average balance of other loans primarily reflected the increased balance of unsecured consumer term loans acquired through Lending Club, as described earlier.\nThe increase in the average balance of commercial and consumer loans was partially offset by a $43.3 million decrease in the average balance of residential mortgage loans to $663.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $706.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of construction loans decreased by $2.6 million to $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $4.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe effect on interest income attributable to the net increase in the average balance of loans was partially offset by the noted decrease in their average yield. The average yield on loans decreased by 14 basis points to 3.76% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 3.90% for the year ended June 30, 2016. The reduction in the overall yield on our loan portfolio largely reflected the effect of the comparatively lower average yield on most newly originated loans in relation to that of the portfolio of existing loans which has reduced the overall yield of the aggregate portfolio. To a lesser extent, the decline in the average yield generally reflects the effects of low market interest rates that provide rate reduction\u201d refinancing incentive to existing borrowers while also contributing to the downward re-pricing of adjustable rate loans.\nInterest income from mortgage-backed securities decreased by $3.3 million to $14.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $17.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in interest income reflected a decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities coupled with a decrease in their average yield.\nThe average balance of mortgage-backed securities decreased by $119.5 million to $621.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $741.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities largely reflected the level of aggregate principal repayments and security sales between comparative periods outpacing aggregate security purchases.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average yield on mortgage-backed securities decreased by eight basis points to 2.25% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 2.33% for the year ended June 30, 2016. The reduction in the overall yield on mortgage-backed securities largely reflected the effect of the comparatively lower average yield on purchased securities in relation to that of the existing portfolio coupled with the continuing repayment of comparatively higher yielding securities within the portfolio.\nInterest income from debt securities increased by $1.9 million to $11.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $9.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in interest income reflected an increase in the average yield on debt securities that was partially offset by a decrease in their average balance. The average yield on debt securities increased 47 basis points to 2.12% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 1.65% for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in yield was largely attributable to floating rate securities whose interest rates have increased due to recent increases in short-term market interest rates. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of debt securities decreased $43.0 million to $559.4 million from $602.4 million.\nThe increase in the average yield on debt securities reflected a 57 basis points increase in the yield on taxable securities to 2.14% during the year ended June 30, 2017 from 1.57% during the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the yield on tax-exempt securities increased two basis points to 2.01% from 1.99%.\nThe decrease in the average balance of debt securities was largely attributable to a $47.5 million decrease in the average balance of taxable securities to $444.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $492.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in taxable securities was partially offset by a $4.5 million increase in the average balance of tax-exempt securities to $114.5 million from $110.0 million.\nInterest income from other interest-earning assets increased by $298,000 to $2.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 reflecting an increase in their average yield that was partially offset by a decrease in their average balance. The average yield on other interest-earning assets increased by 90 basis points to 1.81% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 0.91% for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of other interest-earning assets decreased by $80.3 million to $114.1 million from $194.5 million. The increase in average yield and decrease in the average balance of other interest earning assets largely reflected the Company's efforts to reduce the opportunity cost of maintaining excess liquidity by reinvesting a portion of cash and cash equivalents into the loan portfolio during the current fiscal year.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased by $4.6 million to $36.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $31.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. As noted earlier, the increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $244.2 million to $3.22 billion for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $2.97 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased six basis points to 1.13% from 1.07%.\nInterest expense attributed to deposits increased by $3.4 million to $22.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $18.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in interest expense was attributable to increases in the average cost and average balance of interest-bearing deposits.\nThe average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased by eight basis points to 0.87% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 0.79% for the year ended June 30, 2016. The net increase in the average cost largely reflected an increase in the average cost of certificates of deposit, which increased 10 basis points to 1.32% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 1.22% for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing checking accounts increased seven basis points to 0.66% from 0.59% while the average cost of savings and club accounts decreased three basis points to 0.13% from 0.16%.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by $175.9 million to $2.53 billion for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $2.36 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in the average balance was reflected across all categories of interest-bearing deposits. For the comparative periods noted, the average balance of certificates of deposit increased by $126.0 million to $1.24 billion from $1.12 billion, the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts increased by $46.8 million to $769.9 million from $723.1 million and the average balance of savings and club accounts increased by $3.1 million to $519.5 million from $516.4 million.\nInterest expense attributed to borrowings increased by $1.2 million to $14.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $13.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in interest expense on borrowings reflected an increase in their average balance that was partially offset by a decrease in their average cost. The average balance of borrowings increased by $68.3 million to $685.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $617.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of borrowings decreased four basis points to 2.10% from 2.14%.\nThe increase in the average balance of borrowings largely reflected a $65.2 million increase in the average balance of FHLB advances to $647.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $582.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of FHLB advances decreased three basis points to 2.21% from 2.24% largely reflecting the Company's greater use of lower-costing, overnight borrowings to temporarily fund a portion of loan growth during the year ended June 30, 2017.\nThe noted increase in the average balance of borrowings also reflected a $3.0 million increase in the average balance of other borrowings, comprised primarily of depositor sweep accounts, to $38.4 million from $35.4 million. The average cost of sweep accounts decreased by 18 basis points to 0.33% from 0.51% between the same comparative periods.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses decreased by $5.3 million to $5.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $10.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was largely attributable to a lower provision on non-impaired\nloans evaluated collectively for impairment coupled with a decrease in specific losses recognized on nonperforming loans individually reviewed for impairment.\nRegarding the provision on non-impaired loans, the noted decrease largely reflected the comparative effects of updates to historical and environmental loss factors between periods. As previously discussed, the changes to historical loss factors generally reflected the impact of a decreased level of net charge offs recognized during the year ended June 30, 2017 on the two-year lookback period used to calculate the Company's historical loss factors coupled with the roll off\u201d of the net charge offs from the same period two years earlier. The Company also updated certain environmental loss factors during the year ended June 30, 2017. Such updates primarily reflected an increase in the level of estimated credit losses attributable to the increased concentration and decreased seasoning in the Company's commercial mortgage loan sectors. To a lesser extent, the net decrease in the provision expense reflected slightly lower growth in the outstanding balance of loans collectively evaluated for impairment during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.\nThe prior discussion regarding the allowance for loan losses also highlighted the impact of the re-segmentation\u201d of the loan portfolio on the Company's environmental loss factors. As noted therein, such loss factors were re-evaluated and re-allocated, where appropriate, to reflect the more granular segmentation of loans in the allowance for loan loss calculation during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Where appropriate, the specific criteria and/or basis upon which the Company derives the environmental loss factors ascribed to loans was also revised or enhanced in conjunction with the segmentation changes noted.\nThe implementation of the segmentation changes within the loan portfolio in the calculation of the allowance for loan loss did not result in a significant change in the required, aggregate balance of the allowance attributable to loans evaluated collectively for impairment. Consequently, the decrease in the provision for loan losses during the year ended June 30, 2017 largely reflected the updates to the historical and environmental loss factors discussed earlier coupled with the lesser effect of a comparatively lower level of growth in the unimpaired portion of the loan portfolio between comparative periods. As noted above, the decrease in provision also reflected a decrease in losses recognized on specific loans individually reviewed for impairment.\nAdditional information regarding the allowance for loan losses and the associated provisions recognized during the year ended June 30, 2017 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 1 and Note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income, excluding gains and losses on the sale securities and gains and losses on the sale and write-down real estate owned, increased by $593,000 to $11.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $10.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase was largely attributable to a $1.1 million increase in the gain on sale of loans. The increase in loan sale gains included a $468,000 increase in gains associated with the sale of SBA loans arising from an increase in loans originated and sold. The increase in loan sale gains also included $631,000 in gains on sale of residential mortgage loans reflecting the continued expansion of the Company's mortgage banking business strategy.\nThe noted increases in non-interest income were partially offset by a $356,000 decrease in the income recognized on bank-owned life insurance that largely reflected the continuing effects of lower market interest rates on the yields earned by the Company on its underlying policies. A decrease in fees and service charges also offset a portion of the overall increase in non-interest income. A significant portion of the decrease in fees and service charges reflected a reduction in deposit-related merchant processing fees that was fully offset by a corresponding decrease in merchant processing service provider expenses that partially offset the increase in non-interest expense within the category of equipment and systems expenses. To a lesser extent, the decrease in fees and service charges also reflected decreases in other deposit-related fees and charges, including account overdraft and electronic banking fees and charges, as well as a reduction in loan-related prepayment charges.\nWe also recognized net losses totaling $106,000 arising from the write down and sale of REO during the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to net losses of $137,000 recognized during the earlier comparative period. The decrease in losses relating to the disposal of real estate owned were partially offset by a nominal decrease in gains and losses arising from the sale and call of securities.\nNon-Interest Expenses. Non-interest expense increased by $8.7 million to $81.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $72.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The net increase in non-interest expense primarily reflected increases in salary and employee benefits expense, director compensation expense and miscellaneous expense with lesser increases reflected in premises occupancy expense, equipment and system expense and advertising and market expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in deposit insurance expense.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased by $5.7 million to $47.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $42.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increases in salaries and employee benefits partly reflected the impact of the Company's 2016 Equity Incentive Plan approved by shareholders in October 2016. Based on the original value of the grants at the time they were issued on December 1, 2016, coupled with the five year vesting period, the aggregate pre-tax\u201d and after-tax\u201d expense\nassociated with the noted grants total approximately $6.2 million and $4.3 million per year, respectively, of which approximately $3.6 million and $2.5 million were recognized during the latter seven months of fiscal 2017, respectively. Approximately $2.5 million of such pre-tax\u201d expenses were allocated and reported in salaries and employee benefits with the remaining $1.1 million included in director compensation, as discussed below.\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits also reflected increases in employee compensation costs arising from an incremental increase in the number of FTE employees during the year as well as overall increases in employee health insurance costs. Additionally, retirement plan-related expenses increased due to an increase in the Company's contribution to its employee defined-benefit pension plan as well as an increase in ESOP expense attributable to the increase in the average market price of the Company's shares of capital stock during fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.\nThe $1.2 million increase in director compensation expense for fiscal 2017 primarily reflected $1.1 million in allocated expenses attributable to director benefits associated with the Company's 2016 Equity Incentive Plan, as noted above. The remaining portion of the variance reflected an increase in director fees that was primarily attributable to the addition of two independent directors during the prior fiscal year whose full-year\u201d annual compensation expense were fully reflected during fiscal 2017.\nWhile reflecting a variety of increases across a number of general and administrative expenses, the $1.4 million increase in miscellaneous expense for fiscal 2017 largely reflected the noteworthy effect of the Company's recognition of a $931,000 non-recurring recovery of pension plan expense during the prior fiscal year that resulted from amending the terms of its Director Consultation and Retirement Plan (the DCRP ).\nThe increase in premises occupancy expense partly reflected an increase in facility rent expense due to the revised terms of certain facility leases renewed during the period coupled with the additional cost of a new ground lease associated with a forthcoming branch relocation. The increase in premises occupancy expense also reflected an increase in facility repairs and maintenance expenses and real estate tax expenses relating to the Company's branch and administrative facilities.\nThe increase in equipment and systems expense largely reflected the recognition of a non-recurring recovery of certain historical data network charges that reduced technology service provider expenses during the prior fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe increase in advertising and marketing expense were primarily attributable to increased print, electronic media and outdoor advertising costs associated with specific campaigns supporting targeted business strategies focused on expansion of commercial business banking and consumer deposit products, services and relationships.\nFinally, the decrease in deposit insurance expense primarily reflected a reduction in the Bank's FDIC assessment rate that went into effect on July 1, 2016.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by $2.0 million to $8.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $6.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in income tax expense primarily reflected the underlying differences in the level of the taxable portion of pre-tax income between comparative periods.\nOur effective tax rates during the years ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 were 32.2% and 30.0% which, in relation to statutory income tax rates, reflected the effects of recurring sources of tax-favored income included in pre-tax income as well as the effects of non-recurring tax deductions recognized on the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options by employees.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $15.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share, an increase of $10.2 million compared to $5.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net income was partly attributable to the effect of the non-recurring $10.0 million charitable contribution that was made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering in fiscal 2015. The increase in net income also reflected increases in net interest income and non-interest income that were partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in non-interest expense, excluding the effects of the charitable contribution noted earlier. In total, these factors resulted in an increase in pre-tax net income between comparative periods. The Company recorded income tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2016. However, the effects of the Company's tax-favored income sources, coupled with other reductions in income tax expense, resulted in the Company recording a net income tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2015.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $95.0 million, an increase of $14.4 million from $80.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income between the comparative periods resulted from an increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase in interest expense. As discussed in greater detail below, the\nincrease in interest income was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets augmented by an increase in their average yield. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost. The average yields and average costs between comparative periods continued to reflect the effects of low interest rates that were prevalent in the marketplace throughout most of fiscal 2016.\nAs a result of these factors, our net interest rate spread decreased 14 basis points to 2.06% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.20% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the net interest rate spread reflected a 19 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 1.07% from 0.88% while the yield on earning assets increased by five basis points to 3.13% from 3.08% between those same comparative periods. A discussion of the factors contributing to the overall change in yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities is presented in the separate discussion and analysis of interest income and interest expense below.\nThe factors resulting in the decrease in net interest rate spread also adversely affected our net interest margin. However, the effects of those factors were more than offset by the beneficial impact to net interest income arising from the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets that was attributable to the investment of the net capital proceeds raised in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second step conversion and stock offering in May 2015. Consequently, the Company's net interest margin increased by one basis point to 2.35% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.34% for the year ended June 30, 2015.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $20.8 million to $126.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $106.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. As noted above, the increase in interest income reflected increases in both the average balance and average yield of interest-earning assets. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased by $603.4 million to $4.05 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $3.45 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average yield on interest-earning assets declined five basis points to 3.13% from 3.08%.\nInterest income from loans increased $21.3 million to $98.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $76.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest income on loans was attributable to a net increase in the average balance of loans that was partially offset by a decline in their average yield.\nThe average balance of loans increased by $662.5 million to $2.51 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.85 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. The reported increase in the average balance of loans primarily reflected an aggregate increase of $607.5 million in the average balance of commercial loans to $1.78 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.18 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. Our commercial loans generally comprise commercial mortgage loans, including multi-family and nonresidential mortgage loans, as well as secured and unsecured commercial business loans. The increase in the average balance of commercial loans included the effects of loan purchases funded with a portion of the proceeds raised in the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that closed in May 2015.\nThe increase in the average balance of total loans also reflected a net increase in the average balance of residential mortgage loans which increased by $43.5 million to $706.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $662.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. Our residential mortgages generally comprise one-to four-family first mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average balance of construction loans decreased $2.8 million to $4.2 million from $7.0 million while the average balance of consumer loans increased $10.8 million to $15.5 million from $4.7 million. The increase in the average balance of consumer loans for fiscal 2016 primarily reflected the effects of the loans acquired through the Company's relationship with Lending Club.\nThe effect on interest income attributable to the net increase in the average balance of loans was partially offset by the noted decrease in their average yield. The average yield on loans decreased by 24 basis points to 3.90% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 4.14% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The reduction in the overall yield on our loan portfolio largely reflects the continuing effect of low market interest rates. Specifically, the average yield on the newly originated loans that provided the incremental growth in the portfolio during fiscal 2016 reflected the generally low level of interest rates prevalent in the marketplace during the period which reduced the overall yield of the loan portfolio.\nInterest income from mortgage-backed securities decreased by $1.3 million to $17.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $18.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in interest income reflected a decrease in the average yield of mortgage-backed securities that was partially offset by an increase in their average balance.\nThe average yield on mortgage-backed securities decreased by 32 basis points to 2.33% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.65% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the overall yield of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio largely reflected the comparatively lower yields of securities purchased during fiscal 2016.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average balance of mortgage-backed securities increased by $37.6 million to $741.2 million from $703.6 million. The increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities largely reflects the effects of security purchases that outpaced principal repayments between comparative periods. The increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities included the effects of security purchases funded with a portion of the proceeds raised in the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that closed in May 2015.\nInterest income from debt securities increased by $717,000 to $9.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $9.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest income reflected an increase in the average yield on debt securities that was partially offset by a decrease in their average balance. The average yield on debt securities increased 21 basis points to 1.65% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.44 % for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of debt securities decreased $34.8 million to $602.4 million from $637.2 million.\nThe increase in the average yield on debt securities reflected a 22 basis point increase in the yield on taxable securities to 1.57% during the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.35% during the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the yield on tax-exempt securities increased four basis points to 1.99% from 1.95%.\nThe decrease in the average balance of debt securities was largely attributable to a $43.5 million decrease in the average balance of taxable securities to $492.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $535.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of tax-exempt securities increased by $8.7 million to $110.0 million from $101.3 million.\nInterest income from other interest-earning assets increased by $173,000 to $1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 reflecting an increase in the average yield that was partially offset by a decline in the average balance. The average yield on other interest-earning assets increased by 29 basis points to 0.91% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 0.62% for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of other interest-earning assets decreased by $61.7 million to $194.5 million from $256.2 million.\nThe changes in the average balance and average yield on other interest-earning assets between comparative periods largely reflected the effects of a temporary increase in low-yielding cash and cash equivalents held during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in these short-term liquid assets during that quarter largely reflected the funds received and held during the subscription phase of our second-step conversion and stock offering as well as the excess liquidity held after the closing of the transaction pending their investment into other higher yielding assets during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased by $6.5 million to $31.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $25.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities as well as an increase in their average cost. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $78.5 million to $2.97 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $2.90 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 19 basis points to 1.07% from 0.88%.\nInterest expense attributed to deposits increased by $2.8 million to $18.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $15.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits coupled with an increase in their average cost.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by $18.2 million to $2.36 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $2.34 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For the comparative periods noted, the average balance of certificates of deposit increased by $91.4 million to $1.12 billion from $1.03 billion, while the average balance of savings and club accounts increased $566,000 to $516.4 million from $515.8 million. These increases were partially offset by a $73.8 million decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts to $723.1 million from $797.0 million.\nThe cost of interest-bearing deposits increased by 11 basis points to 0.79% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 0.68% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The net increase in the average cost was partly attributable to a 13 basis points increase in the average cost of certificates of deposit which increased to 1.22% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.09% for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing checking accounts increased nine basis points to 0.59% from 0.50%, while the average cost of savings and club accounts remained stable at 0.16% between those same comparative periods.\nThe decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts and the corresponding increase in their average cost largely reflected the effects of the low-cost funds held in such accounts during the subscription phase of our second step conversion and stock offering in fiscal 2015. Conversely, the increase in the average balance and average cost of certificates of deposits largely reflected the effects of attracting higher-cost, longer-term funding through our retail deposit channels for interest rate risk management purposes.\nInterest expense attributed to borrowings increased by $3.7 million to $13.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $9.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense on borrowings reflected increases in their average balance and average cost. The average balance of borrowings increased by $60.3 million to $617.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $557.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of borrowings increased 44 basis points to 2.14% from 1.70%.\nThe net increase in the average balance of borrowings largely reflected a $55.6 million increase in the average balance of FHLB advances which increased to $582.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $526.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of FHLB advances increased 47 basis points to 2.24% from 1.77%. As noted earlier, the increase in the average balance of FHLB advances primarily reflected an additional short-term advance of $50.0 million drawn during the year ended June 30, 2016 whose cost had been effectively fixed over a five-year period based on a previously executed interest rate swap transaction whose terms became effective during the period.\nThe net increase in the average balance of borrowings also reflected a $4.7 million increase in the average balance of other borrowings, comprised primarily of depositor sweep accounts, to $35.4 million from $30.7 million. The average cost of sweep accounts increased one basis point to 0.51% from 0.50% between comparative periods.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses increased $4.6 million to $10.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $6.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The net increase in the provision primarily reflected updates to historical and environmental loss factors utilized to measure impairment on collectively evaluated loans. The increase in provision expense also reflected the greater growth in such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in provision expense attributable to these factors was partially offset by a net decrease in specific losses recognized on loans evaluated individually for impairment that largely reflected a higher level of recoveries recognized on such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nAdditional information regarding the allowance for loan losses and the associated provisions recognized during the year ended June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this annual report on Form 10-K, as well as in Note 1 and Note 8 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income, excluding gains and losses on the sale of securities and REO, increased by $2.2 million to $10.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $8.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase was partly attributable to an increase in the income arising from our investment in bank-owned life insurance due largely to the growth in the average balance of the cash surrender value of the various policies held by the Company. The Company had also recognized payouts on life insurance policies totaling $1.4 million during the prior year ended June 30, 2015 for which no such payouts were recognized during the year ended June 30, 2016. Absent the effect of these payouts, income from bank owned life insurance increased by approximately $3.0 million reflecting the noted increase in the average balance of the policies less the effects of a decrease in the earnings rate on such policies attributable to the sustained effects of lower long-term market interest rates.\nThe increase in non-interest income also reflected a net increase in fees and service charges that was primarily attributable to an increase in loan prepayment charges. The increase in loan prepayment charges were augmented, to a lesser degree, by a net increase in deposit-related fees and service charges, including ATM and debit card transaction fees separately reported under electronic banking fees and charges.\nThe increase in non-interest income reflected an increase in loan sale gains attributable to a $243,000 increase in SBA loan sale gains reflecting an overall increase in related loan origination and sale activity. The increase in loan sale gains also reflected $82,000 in gains on sale of residential mortgage loans arising from the initial implementation of the Company's mortgage banking business strategy during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nThe noted increases in non-interest income were partially offset by a decrease in miscellaneous income that primarily reflected the recognition of a $370,000 non-recurring adjustment to gain on bargain purchase during the year ended June 30, 2015 relating to the Company's prior acquisition of Atlas Bank.\nThe noted net increase in non-interest income was augmented by a decrease in net losses relating to write downs and sales of real estate owned between comparative periods. The decrease in losses relating to the disposal of real estate owned were partially offset by a nominal decrease in gains arising from the sale and call of securities.\nNon-Interest Expenses. Non-interest expense decreased by $5.7 million to $72.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $78.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. However, non-interest expense for fiscal 2015 included a non-recurring $10.0 million charitable contribution that was made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering. Excluding the effect of that charitable contribution, included in miscellaneous expense during the prior fiscal year, non-interest expense increased by $4.3 million during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nThe increase in non-interest expense, as adjusted, reflected increases in salaries and employee benefits, advertising and marketing, deposit insurance and director compensation expenses that were partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous expense coupled with less noteworthy decreases in premises occupancy expense and equipment and systems expense that generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those categories.\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits expense partly reflected the limited and controlled expansion of the human resources within our various business lines and, where needed, the supporting operating and risk management departments. The incremental increase in expense associated with these new resources was partially defrayed by our efforts to improve overall operating efficiency during fiscal 2016 that resulted in a net decrease in the number of full time equivalent ( FTE\u201d) employees for the year that was achieved largely through reallocation and attrition of resources. The increase in compensation-related expenses also included an increase in the cost of employee healthcare benefits as well as an increase in ESOP expense that was primarily attributable to the increase in the Company's average share price between comparative periods.\nThe noted increase in advertising and marketing expenses was largely attributable to expanded corporate and business line advertising campaigns across the print, electronic media and outdoor advertising formats while the reported increase in deposit insurance expense largely reflected the overall growth in the Company's total assets that serves as a contributing basis to the calculation of FDIC insurance premiums.\nThe increase in non-interest expense also reflected an increase in director compensation expense that was primarily attributable to the addition of two independent directors during fiscal 2016. This increase in director compensation was more than offset by the effect of a non-recurring curtailment gain on pension plan expense totaling $931,000 that was recognized in miscellaneous expense during fiscal 2016. The curtailment gain resulted from the amendment of the Company's Directors Consultation and Retirement Plan (the DCRP\u201d) during the year. The noted amendments froze the DCRP such that no additional DCRP benefits accrue to any participant after December 31, 2015 and revised the minimum age requirement for benefit vesting purposes.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by $8.1 million to income tax expense of $6.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from an income tax benefit of $1.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The provision for both periods reflected the effects of the Company's recurring sources of tax-favored income on taxable net income for each year. Such recurring tax-favored income sources include interest income on municipal obligations and the income arising from periodic increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance.\nHowever, the taxable portion of the Company's net income for fiscal 2015 also reflected the effects of certain non-recurring sources of non-taxable income including a $1.4 million payout on bank-owned life insurance policies. In that regard, we also recognized a non-taxable adjustment to gain on bargain purchase totaling $370,000 during fiscal 2015 relating to the acquisition of Atlas Bank that exceeded the original bargain purchase gain of $226,000 recognized on that transaction during fiscal 2014.\nIn addition to these items, the income tax provision for fiscal 2015 reflected the utilization of a net operating loss carry forward originated by Kearny MHC, our prior mutual holding company, arising from its merger into the Company in conjunction with the second step conversion and stock offering. The value of that carry-forward had not been recognized in prior years resulting in a $354,000 income tax benefit to the Company during fiscal 2015. The income tax provision for fiscal 2015 also reflected a $416,000 income tax benefit arising from the exercise of stock options during the year.\nAfter adjusting for the effects of these recurring and non-recurring factors, the overall increase in the income tax provision largely reflected the underlying differences in the taxable portion of pre-tax income between comparative periods. Our effective income tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2016 was 30.0%, which primarily reflected the effects of recurring sources of tax-favored income. By comparison, our effective income tax rate (benefit) during the year ended June 30, 2015 was (29.1)% which, in relation to statutory income tax rates, reflected the effects of the recurring and non-recurring items noted above.\nAverage Balance Sheet. The following table sets forth certain information relating to Kearny Financial at and for the periods indicated. We derived the average yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented with daily balances used to derive average balances. No tax equivalent adjustments have been made to yield or costs.\n\n (1) Loans held-for-sale and non-accruing loans have been included in loans receivable and the effect of such inclusion was not material. Allowance for loan losses has been included in non-interest-earning assets. \n (2) Mark-to-market valuation allowances have been excluded in the balances of interest-earning assets. \n (3) Includes interest-bearing deposits at other banks and Federal Home Loan Bank of New York capital stock. \n (4) Includes actual balance of non-interest-bearing deposits of $267,412,000 at June 30, 2017 and average balances of non-interest-bearing deposits of $249,693,000, $225,396,000, and $217,856,000for the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. \n (5) Interest rate spread represents the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. \n (6) Net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. \nRate/Volume Analysis. The following table reflects the sensitivity of Kearny Financial's interest income and interest expense to changes in volume and in prevailing interest rates during the periods indicated. Each category reflects the: (1) changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by old rate); (2) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by old volume); and (3) net change. The net change attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate has been allocated proportionally to the absolute dollar amounts of change in each.\n\nLiquidity and Commitments\nOur liquidity, represented by cash and cash equivalents, is a product of our operating, investing and financing activities. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization, prepayments and maturities of mortgage-backed securities and outstanding loans, maturities and calls of securities and funds provided from operations. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets, such as overnight deposits, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. While scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage-backed securities and maturing securities and short-term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, general interest rates, economic conditions and competition greatly influence deposit flows and prepayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities.\nKearny Bank is required to have enough investments that qualify as liquid assets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe operation. Liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans. We attempt to maintain adequate but not excessive liquidity and liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management.\nCash and cash equivalents, consisting primarily of deposits in other banks, decreased $121.0 million to $78.2 million at June 30, 2017 from $199.2 million at June 30, 2016. The balance of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 reflected a temporary accumulation of short-term, liquid assets arising from an increase in loan prepayments during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The Company reinvested a significant portion of that excess liquidity back into the loan portfolio during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe balance of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2017 included funds on deposit at other institutions totaling $62.5 million and other cash-related items, consisting primarily of vault cash and cash held by, or in transit to/from, our cash repository service provider, totaling $15.7 million. Cash and equivalents on deposit at other institutions at June 30, 2017 included $4.8 million held by the FHLB, $53.6 million held by the FRB as well as $4.1 million held at three U.S. domestic money center banks representing funds on deposit totaling $2.3 million, $1.0 million and $824,000, respectively, at June 30, 2017.\nManagement reviews cash flow projections regularly and updates them monthly in order to maintain liquid assets at levels believed to meet the requirements of normal operations, including loan commitments and potential deposit outflows from maturing certificates of deposit and other deposit withdrawals. At June 30, 2017, Kearny Bank had commitments to originate and purchase loans totaling $95.2 million compared to $35.6 million at June 30, 2016. As of those same comparative dates, construction loans in process and unused lines of credit were $8.1 and $60.7 million, respectively, compared to $73,000 and $55.4 million, respectively. Kearny Bank had $610.8 million of certificates of deposit maturing in one year at June 30, 2017 compared to $666.1 million at June 30, 2016.\nDeposits increased $235.3 million to $2.93 billion at June 30, 2017 from $2.69 billion at June 30, 2016. Between those comparative periods, non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased $28.7 million to $267.4 million, interest-bearing demand deposits increased $115.0 million to $847.7 million, savings and club deposits increased $8.0 million to $524.0 million while certificates of deposit increased $83.6 million to $1.29 billion.\nBorrowings from the FHLB of New York and other sources are generally available to supplement Kearny Bank's liquidity position and to the extent that maturing deposits do not remain with us, management may replace the funds with such borrowings. Kearny Bank has the capacity to borrow additional funds from the FHLB by taking additional long-term or short-term advances including overnight borrowings. As of June 30, 2017, Kearny Bank's borrowing potential was $882.1 million without pledging additional collateral.\nThe following table sets forth information concerning balances and interest rates on our short-term borrowings at and for the periods shown:\n\nThe following table discloses our contractual obligations and commitments as of June 30, 2017.\n\n (1) Represents amounts committed to customers. \nIn addition to the loan commitments noted above, the Company has outstanding commitments to originate loans held for sale totaling $18.4 million at June 30, 2017. Origination commitments on loans held for sale whose terms include interest rate locks to borrowers are generally paired with a non-binding\u201d best-efforts commitment to sell the loan to a buyer at a fixed price and within a predetermined timeframe after the sale commitment is established.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of our business of investing in loans and securities as well as in the normal course of maintaining and improving Kearny Bank's facilities. These financial instruments include significant purchase commitments, such as commitments related to capital expenditure plans and commitments to purchase securities or mortgage-backed securities and commitments to extend credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. We had no significant off-balance sheet commitments to purchase securities as of June 30, 2017.\nIn addition to the commitments noted above, Kearny Bank is party to standby letters of credit totaling approximately $715,000 at June 30, 2017 through which we guarantee certain specific business obligations of our commercial customers.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nAt June 30, 2017, outstanding loan commitments relating to loans held in portfolio totaled $163.9 million compared to $91.0 million at June 30, 2016. As of that same date, the Company also had outstanding commitments to originate loans held for sale totaling $18.4 million that are considered derivative instruments whose values are not considered to be material for financial statement reporting purposes. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. For additional information regarding our outstanding lending commitments at June 30, 2017, see Note 14 and Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nCapital\nConsistent with our goals to operate as a sound and profitable financial organization, Kearny Financial and Kearny Bank actively seek to maintain our well capitalized status in accordance with regulatory standards. As of June 30, 2017, Kearny Financial and Kearny Bank exceeded all capital requirements of the federal banking regulators and were considered well capitalized\u201d.\nKearny Bank's regulatory capital ratios at June 30, 2017 were as follows: Tier 1 leverage ratio 15.47%; Common Equity Tier I risk-based capital 22.39%; Tier I risk-based capital 22.39%; and total risk-based capital 23.30%.\nKearny Financial's regulatory capital ratios at June 30, 2017 were as follows: Tier 1 leverage ratio 20.11%; Common Equity Tier I risk-based capital 29.08%; Tier I risk-based capital 29.08%; and total risk-based capital 29.98%.\nThe regulatory capital requirements to be considered well capitalized at June 30, 2017 were as follows: Tier 1 leverage ratio 5.0%; Common Equity Tier I risk-based capital 6.5%; Tier I risk-based capital 8.0%; and total risk-based capital 10.0%.\nFor additional information regarding regulatory capital at June 30, 2017, see Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe financial statements included in this document have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.\nOur primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates, however, do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation. In a period of rapidly rising interest rates, the liquidity and maturities of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels.\nThe principal effect of inflation on earnings, as distinct from levels of interest rates, is in the area of non-interest expense. Expense items such as employee compensation, employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation. An additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in the dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made. We are unable to determine the extent, if any, to which properties securing our loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of the expected impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements that have yet to be adopted by us, please refer to Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_tables": "Table 98:

text is an excerpt from the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) from the Kearny Financial Corp.'s annual report on Form 10-K. Here is a summarized version of the provided sections:\n\n**Overview:**\n\n- Total assets increased by $318.1 million to $4.82 billion.\n- The growth in assets was primarily due to an increase in net loans receivable, partly offset by decreases in securities and cash equivalents.\n- The asset increase was funded by higher deposits and borrowings with a partial offset by a decrease in stockholders' equity.\n- Total loans receivable went up by $571.3 million, reflecting a strategic emphasis on growing the commercial loan portfolio.\n- Securities and cash equivalents saw a decrease.\n- Deposits rose by $235.3 million, with non-maturity and certificate of deposit accounts both contributing to this growth.\n- Borrowings increased by $191.8 million due to new FHLB advances to fund loan growth.\n- Stockholders' equity decreased by $90.4 million due to share repurchases, which was partly offset by net income and other comprehensive income.\n\n**Results of Operations:**\n\n- Net income for the fiscal year increased by $2.8 million to $18.6 million.\n- Net interest income grew by $7.6 million primarily due to an increase in interest income from a larger average balance of interest-earning assets and a higher average yield.\n- The provision for loan losses decreased by $5.3 million, reflecting lower specific losses on impaired loans and a decrease in historical loss factors.\n- Non-interest income increased modestly, driven by higher loan sale gains and partially offset by reduced investment income from bank-owned life insurance and decreased fees and service charges.\n- Non-interest expenses increased primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits, director compensation, and miscellaneous expenses.\n- Critical accounting policies involve estimates that impact reported financials. Key areas include the allowance for loan losses, security impairment assessments, and goodwill impairment testing.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital:**\n\n- Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $121.0 million to $78.2 million.\n- The bank had loan commitments totaling $95.2 million as of June 30, 2017.\n- FHLB borrowings can be used to supplement liquidity needs.\n- Kearny Financial and Kearny Bank maintain well-capitalized status, with ratios surpassing regulatory requirements.\n\n**Recent Accounting Pronouncements:**\n\n- For the impact of recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted by Kearny Financial Corp., refer to Note 2 in the audited financial statements.\n\nThe MD&A aims to provide an understanding of the financial condition, changes therein, and results of operations for Kearny Financial Corp. The report includes detailed analysis of the balance sheet, income statement, liquidity, capital resources, and the effect of inflation on financial performance. It also notes that recent accounting pronouncements that have not been adopted may impact future reports."}
