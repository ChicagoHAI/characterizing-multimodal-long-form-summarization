Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors and risks including the impact of the weakness in the U.S. and international economies on our business, our inability to manage our future growth effectively or profitably, fluctuations in our revenue and quarterly results, our license renewal rate, the impact of competition and our ability to maintain margins or market share, the limited market for our common stock, the ability to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the volatility of the market price of our common stock, the ability to raise capital, the performance of our products, our ability to respond to rapidly evolving technology and customer requirements, our ability to protect our proprietary technology, the security of our software, our dependence on our management team and key personnel, our ability to hire and retain future key personnel, or our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls. These and other risks are more fully described herein and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThis section should be read in combination with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related notes prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.\nOverview\nBridgeline Digital, The Digital Engagement Company\u2122, enables its customers to maximize the performance of their mission critical websites, intranets, and online stores.

We had a net loss for fiscal 2016 of ($7.8) million compared with a net loss of ($16.8) million for fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, we converted $3.0 million of secured subordinated debt to equity, which resulted in a non-cash inducement charge of $3.4 million. In fiscal 2015, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $10.5 million, which comprised the majority of the loss in fiscal 2015. This was also a non-cash charge to operations.

17%, to $15.9 million from $19.2 million in fiscal 2015. Our revenue is derived from three sources: (i) digital engagement services; (ii) subscription and perpetual licenses; and (iii) managed service hosting.\nDigital Engagement Services\nDigital engagement services revenue is comprised of iAPPS digital engagement services and other digital engagement services generated from non-iAPPS related engagements. Total revenue from digital engagement services decreased $3.4 million, or 28% to $8.5 million in fiscal 2016 from $11.9 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease in digital engagement services revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to the prior period is due primarily to a decrease in larger value iAPPS engagements.\nDigital engagement services revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 54% in fiscal 2016 from 62% in fiscal 2015. The decrease is attributable to the decrease in the number of iAPPS license related engagements and lower margin iAPPSds engagements. The Company has also been focused on selling iAPPS engagements that have a smaller services component which results in a shorter sales cycle and a shorter implementation cycle. This has strategically decreased the percentage of service revenue compared to total revenue and increased the percentage of license revenue to total revenue.\nSubscription and Perpetual Licenses\nRevenue from subscription (SaaS) and perpetual licenses increased $292 thousand, or 5% to $6.1 million in fiscal 2016 from $5.8 million in fiscal 2015. Subscription and perpetual license revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 38% in fiscal 2016 from 30% in fiscal 2015. The increases are due primarily to a higher concentration of iAPPS subscription license revenues and a decrease in perpetual licenses.\nManaged Service Hosting\nRevenue from managed service hosting decreased $238 thousand, or 16%, to $1.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $1.5 million in fiscal 2015. The decreases are due to the non-renewal of engagements with smaller hosting customers obtained through previous acquisitions combined with a majority of our new engagements that are SaaS engagements and do not have a separate managed hosting component. Managed services revenue as a percentage of total revenue remained constant at 8% for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015.\nThe decreases are due to most of our new engagements being subscription licenses (SaaS) rather than perpetual licenses, which typically require hosting.\nCost of Revenue\nTotal cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 decreased $3.8 million, or 34%, to $7.3 million from $11.0 million in fiscal 2015.\nCost of Digital Engagement Services\nCost of digital engagement services decreased $3.6 million, or 41%, compared to fiscal 2015. The cost of total digital engagement services as a percentage of total digital engagement services revenue decreased to 60% in fiscal 2016 from 73% in fiscal 2015. The decreases are attributable to aligning labor costs with expected revenues and the focus on reducing our facility and overhead costs.\nCost of Subscription and Perpetual License\nCost of subscription and perpetual licenses decreased $159 thousand or 8% to $1.8 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $2.0 million in fiscal 2015. The cost of subscription and perpetual licenses as a percentage of subscription and perpetual license revenue decreased to 30% in fiscal 2016 from 34% in fiscal 2015. The decreases are due to the cessation of amortization costs related to the capitalization of software partially offset by fixed costs to support our network operations center.\nCost of Managed Service Hosting\nCost of managed service hosting decreased $3 thousand or 1% in fiscal 2016 to $304 thousand compared to $307 thousand in fiscal 2015. The cost of managed services as a percentage of managed services revenue increased to 24% in fiscal 2016 from 20% in fiscal 2015. The percentage increase is attributable to maintaining a certain level of fixed costs to support the network operations center.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased $428 thousand, or 5% in fiscal 2016 to $8.6 million compared to $8.2 million in fiscal 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to the increase in iAPPS SaaS licenses revenue. The increase is related to a higher percentage of our revenue coming from license and managed service hosting, as well as the result of a number of improvements we have made with our facilities and services organization.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $826 thousand, or 14% to $4.9 million in fiscal 2016 from $5.8 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in headcount and facility costs and travel related expenditures, partially offset by increases in marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue increased to 31% in fiscal 2016 compared to 30% in fiscal 2015. The increase as a percentage of total revenue is attributable to the decrease in overall revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $479 thousand, or 12% to $3.5 million in fiscal 2016 from $3.9 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease is attributable to decreases in compensation related expenses and legal expenses. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 22% in fiscal 2016 compared to 20% in fiscal 2015. The increase as a percentage of revenue is attributable to the decrease in revenues.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense decreased by $323 thousand, or 17% to $1.6 million in fiscal 2016 from $1.9 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 is attributable to a decrease in compensation related costs. In order to compensate for headcount reduction in services, employees from our development group assisted the delivery team to maintain certain production schedules and their costs were charged to cost of digital engagement services. Research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue was 10% for both periods.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $386 thousand, or 23% to $1.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $1.7 million in fiscal 2015. This decrease is primarily attributable to retirement of fixed assets in relation to a reduction of office space during fiscal 2016 and a reduction in capital expenditure purchases in fiscal 2016. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 8% in fiscal 2016 from 9% in fiscal 2015.\nGoodwill Impairment\nWe performed our annual assessment of goodwill for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. We concluded that there was no impairment loss for 2016. In 2015, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting unit were less than their carrying amounts and that there should be an impairment loss. We determined that the most appropriate approach to use to determine the fair value of the reporting unit was the discounted cash flow method. A comparison to the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value resulted in an impairment charge of $10.5 million for fiscal 2015.\nRestructuring Expenses\nDuring the second half of fiscal 2015 and through fiscal 2016, the Company's management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies by implementing cost reductions in line with the expected decrease in revenues. The Company renegotiated several office leases. We entered in into sub-leases for the original space and moved to new less expensive leases or vacated the office space entirely. In addition, the Company executed a general work-force reduction in fiscal 2015 and recognized costs for severance and termination benefits. These restructuring charges and accruals require estimates and assumptions, including contractual rental commitments or lease buy-outs for vacated office space and related costs, and estimated sub-lease income. The Company's sub-lease assumptions include the rates to be charged to a sub-tenant and the timing of the sub-lease arrangement. These estimates and assumptions will be monitored on a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances with the corresponding adjustments reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.\nIn total, a charge of $879 and $496 was recorded to restructuring expenses for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 in the consolidated statement of operations for the total lease expenses less sub-lease rental income, other miscellaneous lease termination costs, loss on disposal of fixed assets, and costs for severance and termination benefits.\nLoss from Operations\nThe loss from operations was ($3.5) million for fiscal 2016 compared to a loss from operations of ($16.1) million for fiscal 2015. The decrease in iAPPS related digital engagement services revenue in fiscal 2016 was partially offset by the reduction in cost of revenue and operating expenses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a net benefit for income tax expense of $47 thousand for fiscal 2016 compared to a net benefit for income tax of $226 thousand for fiscal 2015. The benefit in 2015 was primarily attributable to the elimination of a naked tax credit related to deductible goodwill from previous acquisitions that was eliminated upon recording a $10.5 million goodwill impairment charge. Income tax expense represents the estimated liability for Federal, state and foreign income taxes owed by the Company, including the alternative minimum tax. The Company has net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax benefits that are available to offset future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company has established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2016 and 2015.\nThe Federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforward of approximately $26.0 million as of September 30, 2016 expires on various dates through 2036. Internal Revenue Code Section 382 places a limitation on the amount of taxable income which can be offset by NOL carryforwards after a change in control of a loss corporation. Generally, after a change in control, a loss corporation cannot deduct NOL carryforwards in excess of the Section 382 limitation. Due to these change of ownership\u201d provisions, utilization of NOL carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods. The Company has not performed a Section 382 analysis. However, if performed, Section 382 may be found to limit potential future utilization of our NOL carryforwards.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe also measure our performance based on a non-GAAP ( Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\u201d) measurement of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and before inducement of debt charges, stock-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and restructuring charges ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d).\nWe believe this non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to management and investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented and provides a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA, however, is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP profitability measures such as (i) income from operations and net income, or (ii) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, both as determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure has material limitations since it excludes the financial statement impact of income taxes, net interest expense, loss on inducement of debt, amortization of intangibles, depreciation, goodwill impairment, restructuring charges, other amortization and stock-based compensation, and therefore does not represent an accurate measure of profitability. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income for a complete analysis of our profitability, as net income includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable GAAP operating performance measure to Adjusted EBITDA. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may also differ from and therefore may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of the limitations that Adjusted EBITDA has as an analytical tool, investors should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP.\nThe following table reconciles net loss (which is the most directly comparable GAAP operating performance measure) to EBITDA, and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended September 30,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,824 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,768 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(226 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>892 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>554 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,065 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,770 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,483 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on inducement of debt (convertible notes)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>496 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>549 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>314 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(785 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,624 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA was ($785) thousand for fiscal 2016 compared with ($2.6) million for fiscal 2015. This was primarily due to the improvement in gross margin along with our focus on reducing our expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities was $2.7 million for fiscal 2016, compared to cash used in operating activities of $2.8 million for fiscal 2015. Although the net loss was reduced in fiscal 2016, we used funds to pay down accounts payable.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $165 thousand for fiscal 2016 compared with $187 thousand for fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily due to less purchases of capital equipment and software in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $3.2 million for fiscal 2016 compared with $2.1 million for fiscal 2015. The increase was due to proceeds from the sale of common stock of $3.7 million and $1 million in term notes from a shareholder offset by payments made on bank term loans, our bank line of credit and contingent acquisition payments. At September 30, 2016, we had an outstanding balance under our credit line with Heritage Bank of $2.1 million.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity Outlook\nIn June 2016, the Company entered into a new Loan and Security Agreement with Heritage Bank of Commerce ( Loan Agreement\u201d). The Loan Agreement has a term of 24 months and will expire on June 9, 2018. The Loan Agreement currently provides for $2.5 million of revolving credit advances and may be used for acquisitions and working capital purposes. The credit advances may not exceed the monthly borrowing base capacity, which will fluctuate based on monthly accounts receivable balances. The Company may request credit advances if the borrowing capacity is more than the current outstanding loan advance, and must pay down the outstanding loan advance if it exceeds the borrowing capacity. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an outstanding balance under the Loan Agreement of $2.1 million.\nIn November 2016, we entered into Securities Purchase Agreements with certain institutional and accredited investors to sell an aggregate total of 2,135,362 shares of our common stock for $0.48 per share ( November Private Placement\u201d). In total, we received net proceeds of $987 thousand. The proceeds will be used to fund current and future operations.\nWe believe that the proceeds from the November Private Placement, cash generated from operations, and borrowing capacity from the Heritage Bank line of credit will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs in the foreseeable future. However, we currently have a borrowing facility with Heritage Bank from which we can borrow, and this line is subject to financial covenants that must be met. It is not certain that all or part of this line will be available to us in the future; and other sources of financing may not be available to us in a timely basis if at all, or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to obtain acceptable funding when needed, we may not have sufficient resources to fund our normal operations, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInflation\nInflationary increases can cause pressure on wages and the cost of benefits offered to employees. We believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, other than our operating leases and contingent acquisition payments.\nWe currently do not have any variable interest entities. We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Therefore, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.\nContractual Obligations\nWe lease our facilities in the United States and India. Other contractual obligations include: (i) certain equipment acquired under capitalized lease agreements and (ii) contingent earnouts in the amount of $75 thousand payable in cash on the achievement of revenue and earnings targets. We have no future commitments that extend past fiscal 2020.\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations:\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended September 30,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Payment obligations by year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> FY17\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> FY18\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> FY19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> FY20\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Line of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital Leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Leases (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,280 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingent acquisition payments (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,515 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> (a) Net of sublease income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (b) The contingent acquisition payments are maximum potential earn-out consideration payable to former owners of acquired companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThese critical accounting policies and estimates by our management should be read in conjunction with Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP\u201d).\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance US GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. The most significant estimates included in our financial statements are the valuation of accounts receivable and long-term assets, including intangibles, goodwill and deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation, amounts of revenue to be recognized on service contracts in progress, unbilled receivables, and deferred revenue. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment:\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> Revenue recognition;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> Allowance for doubtful accounts;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> Accounting for cost of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> Accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> Accounting for stock-based compensation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nOverview\nThe Company enters into arrangements to sell digital engagement services (professional services), software licenses or combinations thereof. Revenue is categorized into (i) digital engagement services; (ii) managed service hosting; and (iii) subscriptions and perpetual licenses.\nThe Company recognizes revenue as required by the Revenue Recognition Topic of the Codification. Revenue is generally recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) delivery has occurred or the services have been provided to the customer; (3) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of the fees is reasonably assured. Billings made or payments received in advance of providing services are deferred until the period these services are provided.\nThe Company maintains a reseller channel to supplement our direct sales force for our iAPPS platform. Resellers are generally located in territories where the Company does not have a direct sales force. Customers generally sign a license agreement directly with us. Revenue from perpetual licenses sold through resellers is recognized upon delivery to the end user as long as evidence of an arrangement exists, collectability is probable, and the fee is fixed and determinable. Revenue for subscription licenses is recognized monthly as the services are delivered.\nDigital Engagement Services\nDigital engagement services include professional services primarily related to the Company's web development solutions that address specific customer needs such as digital strategy, information architecture and usability engineering, .Net development, rich media development, back end integration, search engine optimization, quality assurance and project management.\nDigital engagement services are contracted for on either a fixed price or time and materials basis. For its fixed price engagements, after assigning the relative selling price to the elements of the arrangement, the Company applies the proportional performance model (if not subject to contract accounting) to recognize revenue based on cost incurred in relation to total estimated cost at completion. The Company has determined that labor costs are the most appropriate measure to allocate revenue among reporting periods, as they are the primary input when providing application development services. Customers are invoiced monthly or upon the completion of milestones. For milestone based projects, since milestone pricing is based on expected hourly costs and the duration of such engagements is relatively short, this input approach principally mirrors an output approach under the proportional performance model for revenue recognition on such fixed priced engagements. For time and materials contracts, revenues are recognized as the services are provided.\nDigital engagement services also include retained professional services contracted for on an on call\u201d basis or for a certain amount of hours each month. Such arrangements generally provide for a guaranteed availability of a number of professional services hours each month on a use it or lose it\u201d basis. For retained professional services sold on a stand-alone basis the Company recognizes revenue as the services are delivered or over the term of the contractual retainer period. These arrangements do not require formal customer acceptance and do not grant any future right to labor hours contracted for but not used.\nSubscriptions and Perpetual Licenses\nThe Company licenses its software on either a perpetual or subscription basis. Customers who license the software on a perpetual basis receive rights to use the software for an indefinite time period and an option to purchase Post-Customer Support ( PCS\u201d). For arrangements that consist of a perpetual license and PCS, as long as Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ( VSOE\u201d) exists for the PCS, then PCS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the period of performance and the perpetual license is recognized on a residual basis. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements are deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and recognized as revenue, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nCustomers may also license the software on a subscription basis, which can be described as Software as a Service\u201d or SaaS\u201d. SaaS is a model of software deployment where an application is hosted as a service provided to customers across the Internet. Subscription agreements include access to the Company's software application via an internet connection, the related hosting of the application, and PCS. Customers receive automatic updates and upgrades, and new releases of the products as soon as they become available. Customers cannot take possession of the software. Subscription agreements are either annual or month-to-month arrangements that provide for termination for convenience by either party upon 90 days' notice. Revenue is recognized monthly as the services are delivered. Set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription services are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the life of subscription period or the expected lives of customer relationships. The Company continues to evaluate the length of the amortization period of the set up fees as it gains more experience with customer contract renewals.\nManaged Service Hosting\nManaged service hosting includes hosting arrangements that provide for the use of certain hardware and infrastructure for those customers who do not wish to host our applications independently. Hosting agreements are either annual or month-to-month arrangements that provide for termination for convenience by either party generally upon 30-days' notice. Revenue is recognized monthly as the hosting services are delivered. Set up fees paid by customers in connection with managed hosting services are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the hosting period or the expected lives of customer relationships. The Company continues to evaluate the length of the amortization period of the set up fees as it gains more experience with customer contract renewals.\nMultiple Element Arrangements\nIn accounting for multiple element arrangements, the Company follows either ASC Topic 605-985 Revenue Recognition Software or ASC Topic 605-25 Revenue Recognition Multiple Element Arrangements, as applicable.\nIn October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition: Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements ( ASU 2009-13\u201d). ASU 2009-13 provides amendments to certain paragraphs of previously issued ASC Subtopic 605-25 - Revenue Recognition: Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. In accordance with ASU 2009-13, each deliverable within a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met (1) the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the delivered item is considered probable and within our control. If the deliverables do not meet the criteria for being a separate unit of accounting then they are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion. The accounting guidance also requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. The accounting guidance also establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. The Company determines selling price using VSOE, if it exists; otherwise, it uses Third-party Evidence ( TPE\u201d). If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a unit of accounting, the Company uses Estimated Selling Price ( ESP\u201d).\nVSOE is generally limited to the price at which the Company sells the element in a separate stand-alone transaction. TPE is determined based on the prices charged by our competitors for a similar deliverable when sold separately. It is difficult for us to obtain sufficient information on competitor pricing, so we may not be able to substantiate TPE. If the Company cannot establish selling price based on VSOE or TPE then it will use ESP. ESP is derived by considering the selling price for similar services and our ongoing pricing strategies. The selling prices used in allocations of arrangement consideration are analyzed at minimum on an annual basis and more frequently if business necessitates a more timely review. The Company has determined that it has VSOE on its SaaS offerings, certain application development services, managed hosting services, and PCS because it has evidence of these elements sold on a stand-alone basis.\nWhen the Company licenses its software on a perpetual basis in a multiple element arrangement that arrangement typically includes PCS and application development services, we follow the guidance of ASC Topic 605-985. In assessing the hierarchy of relative selling price for PCS, we have determined that VSOE is established for PCS. VSOE for PCS is based on the price of PCS when sold separately, which has been established via annual renewal rates. Similarly, when the Company licenses its software on a perpetual basis in a multiple element arrangement that also includes managed service hosting ( hosting\u201d), we have determined that VSOE is established for hosting based on the price of the hosting when sold separately, which has been established based on renewal rates of the hosting contract. Revenue recognition for perpetual licenses sold with application development services are considered on a case by case basis. The Company has not established VSOE for perpetual licenses or fixed price development services and therefore in accordance with ASC Topic 605-985, when perpetual licenses are sold in multiple element arrangements including application development services where VSOE for the services has not been established, the license revenue is deferred and recognized using contract accounting. The Company has determined that services are not essential to the functionality of the software and it has the ability to make estimates necessary to apply proportional performance model. In those cases where perpetual licenses are sold in a multiple element arrangement that includes application development services where VSOE for the services has been established, the license revenue is recognized under the residual method and the application services are recognized upon delivery.\nIn determining VSOE for the digital engagement services element, the separability of the services from the software license and the value of the services when sold on a standalone basis are considered. The Company also considers the categorization of the services, the timing of when the services contract was signed in relation to the signing of the perpetual license contract and delivery of the software, and whether the services can be performed by others. The Company has concluded that its application development services are not required for the customer to use the product but, rather enhance the benefits that the software can bring to the customer. In addition, the services provided do not result in significant customization or modification of the software and are not essential to its functionality, and can also be performed by the customer or a third party. If an application development services arrangement does qualify for separate accounting, the Company recognizes the perpetual license on a residual basis. If an application development services arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, the Company recognizes the perpetual license under the proportional performance model as described above.\nWhen subscription arrangements are sold with application development services, the Company uses its judgment as to whether the application development services qualify as a separate unit of accounting. When subscription service arrangements involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting, the Company allocates arrangement consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables based on the relative selling price model in accordance with the selling price hierarchy, which includes: (i) VSOE when available; (ii) TPE if VSOE is not available; and (iii) ESP if neither VSOE or TPE is available. For those subscription arrangements sold with multiple elements whereby the application development services do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting, the application services revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period. Subscriptions also include a PCS component, and the Company has determined that the two elements cannot be separated and must be recognized as one unit over the applicable service period. Set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription arrangements are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the hosting period or the expected lives of customer relationships, which generally range from two to three years. The Company continues to evaluate the length of the amortization period of the set up fees as it gains more experience with customer contract renewals and our newer product offerings.\nCustomer Payment Terms\nPayment terms with customers typically require payment 30 days from invoice date. Payment terms may vary by customer but generally do not exceed 45 days from invoice date. Invoicing for digital engagement services are either monthly or upon achievement of milestones and payment terms for such billings are within the standard terms described above. Invoicing for subscriptions and hosting are typically issued monthly and are generally due in the month of service. The Company's subscription and hosting agreements provide for refunds when service is interrupted for an extended period of time and are reserved for in the month in which they occur if necessary.\nOur digital engagement services agreements with customers do not provide for any refunds for services or products and therefore no specific reserve for such is maintained. In the infrequent instances where customers raise a concern over delivered products or services, we have endeavored to remedy the concern and all costs related to such matters have been insignificant in all periods presented.\nWarranty\nCertain arrangements include a warranty period, which is generally 30 days from the completion of work. In hosting arrangements, we provide warranties of up-time reliability. We continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the warranties to identify if a warranty claim may arise. If we determine that a warranty claim is probable, then any related cost to satisfy the warranty obligation is estimated and accrued. Warranty claims to date have been immaterial.\nReimbursable Expenses\nIn connection with certain arrangements, reimbursable expenses are incurred and billed to customers and such amounts are recognized as both revenue and cost of revenue.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which represents estimated losses resulting from the inability, failure or refusal of our clients to make required payments.\nWe analyze historical percentages of uncollectible accounts and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We use an internal collection effort, which may include our sales and services groups as we deem appropriate. Although we believe that our allowances are adequate, if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if we underestimate the allowances required, additional allowances may be necessary, resulting in increased expense in the period in which such determination is made.\nAccounting for Cost of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed\nWe charge research and development expenditures for technology development to operations as incurred. However, in accordance with Codification 985-20 Costs of Software to be Sold Leased or Otherwise Marketed, we capitalize certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. Based on our product development process, technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model. Certain costs incurred between completion of a working model and the point at which the product is ready for general release is capitalized if significant. Once the product is available for general release, the capitalized costs are amortized in cost of sales.\nAccounting for Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of every year and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. In assessing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We assess goodwill at the consolidated level as one reporting unit. If this is the case, then performing the quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. An entity can choose not to perform a qualitative assessment for any or all of its reporting units, and proceed directly to the use of the two-step impairment test. In assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we assess relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of a reporting unit. The identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting unit's fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments by management. These judgments include the consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, events which are specific to Bridgeline, and trends in the market price of our common stock. Each factor is assessed to determine whether it impacts the impairment test positively or negatively, and the magnitude of any such impact.\nFor fiscal 2016, the Company performed the annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2016 and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were less than their carrying amounts. In estimating fair value, the Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis on the reporting unit to determine fair value. The inputs to the discounted cash flow model are considered level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The impairment test performed by the Company indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was more than its corresponding carrying amount. As a result of the analyses performed, the Company assessed that goodwill was not impaired.\nFor fiscal 2015, the Company performed the annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2015, using the qualitative approach described above. Based on the qualitative assessment, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were less than their carrying amounts. While there were numerous positive qualitative factors discovered during the qualitative analysis, the instability of the market price of the Company's common stock and the decline in revenues were significant adverse factors that directed a full assessment. (See Note 7) In estimating fair value, the Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis on the reporting unit to determine fair value. The inputs to the discounted cash flow model are considered level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The impairment test performed by the Company indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its corresponding carrying amount. As a result of the analyses performed, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $10.5 million in 2015.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nAt September 30, 2016, we maintained two stock-based compensation plans, one of which has expired but still contains vested and unvested stock options. The two plans are more fully described in Note 12 of these consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with the Compensation-Stock Topic of the Codification. Share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values.\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for share-based payments issued or assumed after October 1, 2006 that are expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally three years. We recognize the fair value of the unvested portion of share-based payments granted prior to October 1, 2006 over the remaining service period, net of estimated forfeitures. In determining whether an award is expected to vest, we use an estimated, forward-looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rate and reduce the expense over the recognition period. Estimated forfeiture rates are updated for actual forfeitures quarterly. We also consider, each quarter, whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our forfeiture rate. Although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. In addition, to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true-up for the difference in the period that the awards vest, and such true-ups could materially affect our operating results.\nWe estimate the fair value of employee stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon United States treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the historical volatility of our publicly traded options in order to estimate future stock price trends. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we use historical trends of employee turnovers. Our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense we record to vary.\nWe record deferred tax assets for stock-based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors and risks including the impact of the weakness in the U.S. and international economies on our business, our inability to manage our future growth effectively or profitably, fluctuations in our revenue and quarterly results, our license renewal rate, the impact of competition and our ability to maintain margins or market share, the limited market for our common stock, the ability to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the volatility of the market price of our common stock, the ability to raise capital, the performance of our products, our ability to respond to rapidly evolving technology and customer requirements, our ability to protect our proprietary technology, the security of our software, our dependence on our management team and key personnel, our ability to hire and retain future key personnel, or our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls.

Our revenue is derived from three sources: (i) digital engagement services; (ii) subscription and perpetual licenses; and (iii) managed service hosting.\nDigital Engagement Services\nDigital engagement services revenue is comprised of iAPPS digital engagement services and other digital engagement services generated from non-iAPPS related engagements. Total revenue from digital engagement services decreased $3.4 million, or 28% to $8.5 million in fiscal 2016 from $11.9 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease in digital engagement services revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to the prior period is due primarily to a decrease in larger value iAPPS engagements.\nDigital engagement services revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 54% in fiscal 2016 from 62% in fiscal 2015. The decrease is attributable to the decrease in the number of iAPPS license related engagements and lower margin iAPPSds engagements. The Company has also been focused on selling iAPPS engagements that have a smaller services component which results in a shorter sales cycle and a shorter implementation cycle. This has strategically decreased the percentage of service revenue compared to total revenue and increased the percentage of license revenue to total revenue.\nSubscription and Perpetual Licenses\nRevenue from subscription (SaaS) and perpetual licenses increased $292 thousand, or 5% to $6.1 million in fiscal 2016 from $5.8 million in fiscal 2015. Subscription and perpetual license revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 38% in fiscal 2016 from 30% in fiscal 2015. The increases are due primarily to a higher concentration of iAPPS subscription license revenues and a decrease in perpetual licenses.\nManaged Service Hosting\nRevenue from managed service hosting decreased $238 thousand, or 16%, to $1.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $1.5 million in fiscal 2015. The decreases are due to the non-renewal of engagements with smaller hosting customers obtained through previous acquisitions combined with a majority of our new engagements that are SaaS engagements and do not have a separate managed hosting component. Managed services revenue as a percentage of total revenue remained constant at 8% for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015.\nThe decreases are due to most of our new engagements being subscription licenses (SaaS) rather than perpetual licenses, which typically require hosting.\nCost of Revenue\nTotal cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 decreased $3.8 million, or 34%, to $7.3 million from $11.0 million in fiscal 2015.\nCost of Digital Engagement Services\nCost of digital engagement services decreased $3.6 million, or 41%, compared to fiscal 2015. The cost of total digital engagement services as a percentage of total digital engagement services revenue decreased to 60% in fiscal 2016 from 73% in fiscal 2015. The decreases are attributable to aligning labor costs with expected revenues and the focus on reducing our facility and overhead costs.\nCost of Subscription and Perpetual License\nCost of subscription and perpetual licenses decreased $159 thousand or 8% to $1.8 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $2.0 million in fiscal 2015. The cost of subscription and perpetual licenses as a percentage of subscription and perpetual license revenue decreased to 30% in fiscal 2016 from 34% in fiscal 2015. The decreases are due to the cessation of amortization costs related to the capitalization of software partially offset by fixed costs to support our network operations center.\nCost of Managed Service Hosting\nCost of managed service hosting decreased $3 thousand or 1% in fiscal 2016 to $304 thousand compared to $307 thousand in fiscal 2015. The cost of managed services as a percentage of managed services revenue increased to 24% in fiscal 2016 from 20% in fiscal 2015. The percentage increase is attributable to maintaining a certain level of fixed costs to support the network operations center.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased $428 thousand, or 5% in fiscal 2016 to $8.6 million compared to $8.2 million in fiscal 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to the increase in iAPPS SaaS licenses revenue. The increase is related to a higher percentage of our revenue coming from license and managed service hosting, as well as the result of a number of improvements we have made with our facilities and services organization.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $826 thousand, or 14% to $4.9 million in fiscal 2016 from $5.8 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in headcount and facility costs and travel related expenditures, partially offset by increases in marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue increased to 31% in fiscal 2016 compared to 30% in fiscal 2015. The increase as a percentage of total revenue is attributable to the decrease in overall revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $479 thousand, or 12% to $3.5 million in fiscal 2016 from $3.9 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease is attributable to decreases in compensation related expenses and legal expenses. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 22% in fiscal 2016 compared to 20% in fiscal 2015. The increase as a percentage of revenue is attributable to the decrease in revenues.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense decreased by $323 thousand, or 17% to $1.6 million in fiscal 2016 from $1.9 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 is attributable to a decrease in compensation related costs. In order to compensate for headcount reduction in services, employees from our development group assisted the delivery team to maintain certain production schedules and their costs were charged to cost of digital engagement services. Research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue was 10% for both periods.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $386 thousand, or 23% to $1.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $1.7 million in fiscal 2015. This decrease is primarily attributable to retirement of fixed assets in relation to a reduction of office space during fiscal 2016 and a reduction in capital expenditure purchases in fiscal 2016. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 8% in fiscal 2016 from 9% in fiscal 2015.\nGoodwill Impairment\nWe performed our annual assessment of goodwill for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. We concluded that there was no impairment loss for 2016. In 2015, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting unit were less than their carrying amounts and that there should be an impairment loss. We determined that the most appropriate approach to use to determine the fair value of the reporting unit was the discounted cash flow method. A comparison to the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value resulted in an impairment charge of $10.5 million for fiscal 2015.\nRestructuring Expenses\nDuring the second half of fiscal 2015 and through fiscal 2016, the Company's management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies by implementing cost reductions in line with the expected decrease in revenues. The Company renegotiated several office leases. We entered in into sub-leases for the original space and moved to new less expensive leases or vacated the office space entirely. In addition, the Company executed a general work-force reduction in fiscal 2015 and recognized costs for severance and termination benefits. These restructuring charges and accruals require estimates and assumptions, including contractual rental commitments or lease buy-outs for vacated office space and related costs, and estimated sub-lease income. The Company's sub-lease assumptions include the rates to be charged to a sub-tenant and the timing of the sub-lease arrangement. These estimates and assumptions will be monitored on a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances with the corresponding adjustments reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.\nIn total, a charge of $879 and $496 was recorded to restructuring expenses for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 in the consolidated statement of operations for the total lease expenses less sub-lease rental income, other miscellaneous lease termination costs, loss on disposal of fixed assets, and costs for severance and termination benefits.\nLoss from Operations\nThe loss from operations was ($3.5) million for fiscal 2016 compared to a loss from operations of ($16.1) million for fiscal 2015. The decrease in iAPPS related digital engagement services revenue in fiscal 2016 was partially offset by the reduction in cost of revenue and operating expenses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a net benefit for income tax expense of $47 thousand for fiscal 2016 compared to a net benefit for income tax of $226 thousand for fiscal 2015. The benefit in 2015 was primarily attributable to the elimination of a naked tax credit related to deductible goodwill from previous acquisitions that was eliminated upon recording a $10.5 million goodwill impairment charge. Income tax expense represents the estimated liability for Federal, state and foreign income taxes owed by the Company, including the alternative minimum tax. The Company has net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax benefits that are available to offset future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company has established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2016 and 2015.\nThe Federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforward of approximately $26.0 million as of September 30, 2016 expires on various dates through 2036. Internal Revenue Code Section 382 places a limitation on the amount of taxable income which can be offset by NOL carryforwards after a change in control of a loss corporation. Generally, after a change in control, a loss corporation cannot deduct NOL carryforwards in excess of the Section 382 limitation. Due to these change of ownership\u201d provisions, utilization of NOL carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods. The Company has not performed a Section 382 analysis. However, if performed, Section 382 may be found to limit potential future utilization of our NOL carryforwards.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe also measure our performance based on a non-GAAP ( Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\u201d) measurement of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and before inducement of debt charges, stock-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and restructuring charges ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d).\nWe believe this non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to management and investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented and provides a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA, however, is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP profitability measures such as (i) income from operations and net income, or (ii) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, both as determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure has material limitations since it excludes the financial statement impact of income taxes, net interest expense, loss on inducement of debt, amortization of intangibles, depreciation, goodwill impairment, restructuring charges, other amortization and stock-based compensation, and therefore does not represent an accurate measure of profitability. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income for a complete analysis of our profitability, as net income includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable GAAP operating performance measure to Adjusted EBITDA. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may also differ from and therefore may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of the limitations that Adjusted EBITDA has as an analytical tool, investors should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP.\nThe following table reconciles net loss (which is the most directly comparable GAAP operating performance measure) to EBITDA, and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended September 30,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,824 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,768 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(226 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>892 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>554 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,065 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,770 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,483 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on inducement of debt (convertible notes)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>496 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>549 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>314 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(785 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,624 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA was ($785) thousand for fiscal 2016 compared with ($2.6) million for fiscal 2015. This was primarily due to the improvement in gross margin along with our focus on reducing our expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities was $2.7 million for fiscal 2016, compared to cash used in operating activities of $2.8 million for fiscal 2015. Although the net loss was reduced in fiscal 2016, we used funds to pay down accounts payable.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $165 thousand for fiscal 2016 compared with $187 thousand for fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily due to less purchases of capital equipment and software in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $3.2 million for fiscal 2016 compared with $2.1 million for fiscal 2015. The increase was due to proceeds from the sale of common stock of $3.7 million and $1 million in term notes from a shareholder offset by payments made on bank term loans, our bank line of credit and contingent acquisition payments. At September 30, 2016, we had an outstanding balance under our credit line with Heritage Bank of $2.1 million.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity Outlook\nIn June 2016, the Company entered into a new Loan and Security Agreement with Heritage Bank of Commerce ( Loan Agreement\u201d). The Loan Agreement has a term of 24 months and will expire on June 9, 2018. The Loan Agreement currently provides for $2.5 million of revolving credit advances and may be used for acquisitions and working capital purposes. The credit advances may not exceed the monthly borrowing base capacity, which will fluctuate based on monthly accounts receivable balances. The Company may request credit advances if the borrowing capacity is more than the current outstanding loan advance, and must pay down the outstanding loan advance if it exceeds the borrowing capacity. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an outstanding balance under the Loan Agreement of $2.1 million.\nIn November 2016, we entered into Securities Purchase Agreements with certain institutional and accredited investors to sell an aggregate total of 2,135,362 shares of our common stock for $0.48 per share ( November Private Placement\u201d). In total, we received net proceeds of $987 thousand. The proceeds will be used to fund current and future operations.\nWe believe that the proceeds from the November Private Placement, cash generated from operations, and borrowing capacity from the Heritage Bank line of credit will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs in the foreseeable future. However, we currently have a borrowing facility with Heritage Bank from which we can borrow, and this line is subject to financial covenants that must be met. It is not certain that all or part of this line will be available to us in the future; and other sources of financing may not be available to us in a timely basis if at all, or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to obtain acceptable funding when needed, we may not have sufficient resources to fund our normal operations, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInflation\nInflationary increases can cause pressure on wages and the cost of benefits offered to employees. We believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, other than our operating leases and contingent acquisition payments.\nWe currently do not have any variable interest entities. We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Therefore, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.\nContractual Obligations\nWe lease our facilities in the United States and India. Other contractual obligations include: (i) certain equipment acquired under capitalized lease agreements and (ii) contingent earnouts in the amount of $75 thousand payable in cash on the achievement of revenue and earnings targets. We have no future commitments that extend past fiscal 2020.\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations:\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> For the Year Ended September 30,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Payment obligations by year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> FY17\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> FY18\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> FY19\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> FY20\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Line of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital Leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating Leases (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>474 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,280 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingent acquisition payments (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,515 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Net of sublease income (b) The contingent acquisition payments are maximum potential earn-out consideration payable to former owners of acquired companies. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThese critical accounting policies and estimates by our management should be read in conjunction with Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP\u201d).\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance US GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. The most significant estimates included in our financial statements are the valuation of accounts receivable and long-term assets, including intangibles, goodwill and deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation, amounts of revenue to be recognized on service contracts in progress, unbilled receivables, and deferred revenue. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment:\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> Revenue recognition;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> Allowance for doubtful accounts;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> Accounting for cost of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed;\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> Accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets; and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> Accounting for stock-based compensation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nOverview\nThe Company enters into arrangements to sell digital engagement services (professional services), software licenses or combinations thereof. Revenue is categorized into (i) digital engagement services; (ii) managed service hosting; and (iii) subscriptions and perpetual licenses.\nThe Company recognizes revenue as required by the Revenue Recognition Topic of the Codification. Revenue is generally recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) delivery has occurred or the services have been provided to the customer; (3) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of the fees is reasonably assured. Billings made or payments received in advance of providing services are deferred until the period these services are provided.\nThe Company maintains a reseller channel to supplement our direct sales force for our iAPPS platform. Resellers are generally located in territories where the Company does not have a direct sales force. Customers generally sign a license agreement directly with us. Revenue from perpetual licenses sold through resellers is recognized upon delivery to the end user as long as evidence of an arrangement exists, collectability is probable, and the fee is fixed and determinable. Revenue for subscription licenses is recognized monthly as the services are delivered.\nDigital Engagement Services\nDigital engagement services include professional services primarily related to the Company's web development solutions that address specific customer needs such as digital strategy, information architecture and usability engineering, .Net development, rich media development, back end integration, search engine optimization, quality assurance and project management.\nDigital engagement services are contracted for on either a fixed price or time and materials basis. For its fixed price engagements, after assigning the relative selling price to the elements of the arrangement, the Company applies the proportional performance model (if not subject to contract accounting) to recognize revenue based on cost incurred in relation to total estimated cost at completion. The Company has determined that labor costs are the most appropriate measure to allocate revenue among reporting periods, as they are the primary input when providing application development services. Customers are invoiced monthly or upon the completion of milestones. For milestone based projects, since milestone pricing is based on expected hourly costs and the duration of such engagements is relatively short, this input approach principally mirrors an output approach under the proportional performance model for revenue recognition on such fixed priced engagements. For time and materials contracts, revenues are recognized as the services are provided.\nDigital engagement services also include retained professional services contracted for on an on call\u201d basis or for a certain amount of hours each month. Such arrangements generally provide for a guaranteed availability of a number of professional services hours each month on a use it or lose it\u201d basis. For retained professional services sold on a stand-alone basis the Company recognizes revenue as the services are delivered or over the term of the contractual retainer period. These arrangements do not require formal customer acceptance and do not grant any future right to labor hours contracted for but not used.\nSubscriptions and Perpetual Licenses\nThe Company licenses its software on either a perpetual or subscription basis. Customers who license the software on a perpetual basis receive rights to use the software for an indefinite time period and an option to purchase Post-Customer Support ( PCS\u201d). For arrangements that consist of a perpetual license and PCS, as long as Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ( VSOE\u201d) exists for the PCS, then PCS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the period of performance and the perpetual license is recognized on a residual basis. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements are deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and recognized as revenue, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nCustomers may also license the software on a subscription basis, which can be described as Software as a Service\u201d or SaaS\u201d. SaaS is a model of software deployment where an application is hosted as a service provided to customers across the Internet. Subscription agreements include access to the Company's software application via an internet connection, the related hosting of the application, and PCS. Customers receive automatic updates and upgrades, and new releases of the products as soon as they become available. Customers cannot take possession of the software. Subscription agreements are either annual or month-to-month arrangements that provide for termination for convenience by either party upon 90 days' notice. Revenue is recognized monthly as the services are delivered. Set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription services are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the life of subscription period or the expected lives of customer relationships. The Company continues to evaluate the length of the amortization period of the set up fees as it gains more experience with customer contract renewals.\nManaged Service Hosting\nManaged service hosting includes hosting arrangements that provide for the use of certain hardware and infrastructure for those customers who do not wish to host our applications independently. Hosting agreements are either annual or month-to-month arrangements that provide for termination for convenience by either party generally upon 30-days' notice. Revenue is recognized monthly as the hosting services are delivered. Set up fees paid by customers in connection with managed hosting services are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the hosting period or the expected lives of customer relationships. The Company continues to evaluate the length of the amortization period of the set up fees as it gains more experience with customer contract renewals.\nMultiple Element Arrangements\nIn accounting for multiple element arrangements, the Company follows either ASC Topic 605-985 Revenue Recognition Software or ASC Topic 605-25 Revenue Recognition Multiple Element Arrangements, as applicable.\nIn October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition: Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements ( ASU 2009-13\u201d). ASU 2009-13 provides amendments to certain paragraphs of previously issued ASC Subtopic 605-25 - Revenue Recognition: Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. In accordance with ASU 2009-13, each deliverable within a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met (1) the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the delivered item is considered probable and within our control. If the deliverables do not meet the criteria for being a separate unit of accounting then they are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion. The accounting guidance also requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. The accounting guidance also establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. The Company determines selling price using VSOE, if it exists; otherwise, it uses Third-party Evidence ( TPE\u201d). If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a unit of accounting, the Company uses Estimated Selling Price ( ESP\u201d).\nVSOE is generally limited to the price at which the Company sells the element in a separate stand-alone transaction. TPE is determined based on the prices charged by our competitors for a similar deliverable when sold separately. It is difficult for us to obtain sufficient information on competitor pricing, so we may not be able to substantiate TPE. If the Company cannot establish selling price based on VSOE or TPE then it will use ESP. ESP is derived by considering the selling price for similar services and our ongoing pricing strategies. The selling prices used in allocations of arrangement consideration are analyzed at minimum on an annual basis and more frequently if business necessitates a more timely review. The Company has determined that it has VSOE on its SaaS offerings, certain application development services, managed hosting services, and PCS because it has evidence of these elements sold on a stand-alone basis.\nWhen the Company licenses its software on a perpetual basis in a multiple element arrangement that arrangement typically includes PCS and application development services, we follow the guidance of ASC Topic 605-985. In assessing the hierarchy of relative selling price for PCS, we have determined that VSOE is established for PCS. VSOE for PCS is based on the price of PCS when sold separately, which has been established via annual renewal rates. Similarly, when the Company licenses its software on a perpetual basis in a multiple element arrangement that also includes managed service hosting ( hosting\u201d), we have determined that VSOE is established for hosting based on the price of the hosting when sold separately, which has been established based on renewal rates of the hosting contract. Revenue recognition for perpetual licenses sold with application development services are considered on a case by case basis. The Company has not established VSOE for perpetual licenses or fixed price development services and therefore in accordance with ASC Topic 605-985, when perpetual licenses are sold in multiple element arrangements including application development services where VSOE for the services has not been established, the license revenue is deferred and recognized using contract accounting. The Company has determined that services are not essential to the functionality of the software and it has the ability to make estimates necessary to apply proportional performance model. In those cases where perpetual licenses are sold in a multiple element arrangement that includes application development services where VSOE for the services has been established, the license revenue is recognized under the residual method and the application services are recognized upon delivery.\nIn determining VSOE for the digital engagement services element, the separability of the services from the software license and the value of the services when sold on a standalone basis are considered. The Company also considers the categorization of the services, the timing of when the services contract was signed in relation to the signing of the perpetual license contract and delivery of the software, and whether the services can be performed by others. The Company has concluded that its application development services are not required for the customer to use the product but, rather enhance the benefits that the software can bring to the customer. In addition, the services provided do not result in significant customization or modification of the software and are not essential to its functionality, and can also be performed by the customer or a third party. If an application development services arrangement does qualify for separate accounting, the Company recognizes the perpetual license on a residual basis. If an application development services arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, the Company recognizes the perpetual license under the proportional performance model as described above.\nWhen subscription arrangements are sold with application development services, the Company uses its judgment as to whether the application development services qualify as a separate unit of accounting. When subscription service arrangements involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting, the Company allocates arrangement consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables based on the relative selling price model in accordance with the selling price hierarchy, which includes: (i) VSOE when available; (ii) TPE if VSOE is not available; and (iii) ESP if neither VSOE or TPE is available. For those subscription arrangements sold with multiple elements whereby the application development services do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting, the application services revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period. Subscriptions also include a PCS component, and the Company has determined that the two elements cannot be separated and must be recognized as one unit over the applicable service period. Set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription arrangements are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the hosting period or the expected lives of customer relationships, which generally range from two to three years. The Company continues to evaluate the length of the amortization period of the set up fees as it gains more experience with customer contract renewals and our newer product offerings.\nCustomer Payment Terms\nPayment terms with customers typically require payment 30 days from invoice date. Payment terms may vary by customer but generally do not exceed 45 days from invoice date. Invoicing for digital engagement services are either monthly or upon achievement of milestones and payment terms for such billings are within the standard terms described above. Invoicing for subscriptions and hosting are typically issued monthly and are generally due in the month of service. The Company's subscription and hosting agreements provide for refunds when service is interrupted for an extended period of time and are reserved for in the month in which they occur if necessary.\nOur digital engagement services agreements with customers do not provide for any refunds for services or products and therefore no specific reserve for such is maintained. In the infrequent instances where customers raise a concern over delivered products or services, we have endeavored to remedy the concern and all costs related to such matters have been insignificant in all periods presented.\nWarranty\nCertain arrangements include a warranty period, which is generally 30 days from the completion of work. In hosting arrangements, we provide warranties of up-time reliability. We continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the warranties to identify if a warranty claim may arise. If we determine that a warranty claim is probable, then any related cost to satisfy the warranty obligation is estimated and accrued. Warranty claims to date have been immaterial.\nReimbursable Expenses\nIn connection with certain arrangements, reimbursable expenses are incurred and billed to customers and such amounts are recognized as both revenue and cost of revenue.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which represents estimated losses resulting from the inability, failure or refusal of our clients to make required payments.\nWe analyze historical percentages of uncollectible accounts and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We use an internal collection effort, which may include our sales and services groups as we deem appropriate. Although we believe that our allowances are adequate, if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if we underestimate the allowances required, additional allowances may be necessary, resulting in increased expense in the period in which such determination is made.\nAccounting for Cost of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed\nWe charge research and development expenditures for technology development to operations as incurred. However, in accordance with Codification 985-20 Costs of Software to be Sold Leased or Otherwise Marketed, we capitalize certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. Based on our product development process, technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model. Certain costs incurred between completion of a working model and the point at which the product is ready for general release is capitalized if significant. Once the product is available for general release, the capitalized costs are amortized in cost of sales.\nAccounting for Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of every year and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. In assessing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We assess goodwill at the consolidated level as one reporting unit. If this is the case, then performing the quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. An entity can choose not to perform a qualitative assessment for any or all of its reporting units, and proceed directly to the use of the two-step impairment test. In assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we assess relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of a reporting unit. The identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting unit's fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments by management. These judgments include the consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, events which are specific to Bridgeline, and trends in the market price of our common stock. Each factor is assessed to determine whether it impacts the impairment test positively or negatively, and the magnitude of any such impact.\nFor fiscal 2016, the Company performed the annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2016 and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were less than their carrying amounts. In estimating fair value, the Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis on the reporting unit to determine fair value. The inputs to the discounted cash flow model are considered level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The impairment test performed by the Company indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was more than its corresponding carrying amount. As a result of the analyses performed, the Company assessed that goodwill was not impaired.\nFor fiscal 2015, the Company performed the annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2015, using the qualitative approach described above. Based on the qualitative assessment, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were less than their carrying amounts. While there were numerous positive qualitative factors discovered during the qualitative analysis, the instability of the market price of the Company's common stock and the decline in revenues were significant adverse factors that directed a full assessment. (See Note 7) In estimating fair value, the Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis on the reporting unit to determine fair value. The inputs to the discounted cash flow model are considered level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The impairment test performed by the Company indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its corresponding carrying amount. As a result of the analyses performed, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $10.5 million in 2015.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nAt September 30, 2016, we maintained two stock-based compensation plans, one of which has expired but still contains vested and unvested stock options. The two plans are more fully described in Note 12 of these consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with the Compensation-Stock Topic of the Codification. Share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values.\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for share-based payments issued or assumed after October 1, 2006 that are expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally three years. We recognize the fair value of the unvested portion of share-based payments granted prior to October 1, 2006 over the remaining service period, net of estimated forfeitures. In determining whether an award is expected to vest, we use an estimated, forward-looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rate and reduce the expense over the recognition period. Estimated forfeiture rates are updated for actual forfeitures quarterly. We also consider, each quarter, whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our forfeiture rate. Although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. In addition, to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true-up for the difference in the period that the awards vest, and such true-ups could materially affect our operating results.\nWe estimate the fair value of employee stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon United States treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the historical volatility of our publicly traded options in order to estimate future stock price trends. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we use historical trends of employee turnovers. Our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense we record to vary.\nWe record deferred tax assets for stock-based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction.", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of factors and risks including the impact of the weakness in the U.S. and international economies on our business, our inability to manage our future growth effectively or profitably, fluctuations in our revenue and quarterly results, our license renewal rate, the impact of competition and our ability to maintain margins or market share, the limited market for our common stock, the ability to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the volatility of the market price of our common stock, the ability to raise capital, the performance of our products, our ability to respond to rapidly evolving technology and customer requirements, our ability to protect our proprietary technology, the security of our software, our dependence on our management team and key personnel, our ability to hire and retain future key personnel, or our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls.

KMWorld Magazine Editors selected Bridgeline Digital as one of the 100 Companies That Matter in Knowledge Management and also selected iAPPS as a Trend Setting Product in 2013.\nBridgeline Digital was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 28, 2000.\nLocations\nThe Company's corporate office is located in Burlington, Massachusetts. The Company maintains regional field offices serving the following geographical locations: Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; Denver, CO; San Luis Obispo, CA; and Tampa, FL. The Company has one wholly-owned subsidiary, Bridgeline Digital Pvt. Ltd. located in Bangalore, India.\nSales and Marketing\nBridgeline employs a direct sales force and each sale takes on average 2-6 months to complete. Each franchise/multi-unit organization sale takes on average one year to complete. Our direct sales force focuses its efforts selling to medium-sized and large companies. These companies are generally categorized in the following vertical markets: (i) financial services; (ii) franchises/multi-unit organizations; (iii) retail brand names; (iv) health services and life sciences; (v) technology (software and hardware); (vi) credit unions and regional banks and (vii) associations and foundations. We have five sales geographic locations in the United States.\nWe have business development professionals dedicated to identifying and establishing strategic alliances for iAPPS and iAPPSds. We have maintained a strategic alliance with UPS Logistics since 2012.

The combined Bridgeline and UPS Logistics offering provides customers with the ability to manage the eCommerce and supply chain fulfillment needs and was designed to benefit mid-market and larger online web stores who seek end to end solutions.\nWe continue to pursue significant strategic alliances that will enhance the sales and distribution opportunities of iAPPS related intellectual property.\nAcquisitions\nBridgeline will continue to evaluate expanding its distribution of iAPPS and its interactive development capabilities through acquisitions. We may make additional acquisitions in the foreseeable future. These potential acquisitions will be consistent with our iAPPS platform distribution strategy and growth strategy by providing Bridgeline with new geographical distribution opportunities, an expanded customer base, an expanded sales force and an expanded developer force. In addition, integrating acquired companies into our existing operations allows us to consolidate the finance, human resources, legal, marketing, research and development of the acquired businesses with our own internal resources, hence reducing the aggregate of these expenses for the combined businesses and resulting in improved operating results.\nCustomer Information\nWe currently have over 3,000 active customers. For the year ended September 30, 2016, one customer represented 10.2% of the Company's total revenue. For the year ended September 30, 2015, there were no customers representing 10% or more of the Company's total revenue.\nSummary of Results of Operations\nTotal revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 ( fiscal 2016\u201d) decreased to $15.9 million from $19.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 ( fiscal 2015\u201d). Loss from operations for fiscal 2016 was ($3.5) million compared with loss from operations of ($16.1) million for fiscal 2015. We had a net loss for fiscal 2016 of ($7.8) million compared with a net loss of ($16.8) million for fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, we converted $3.0 million of secured subordinated debt to equity, which resulted in a non-cash inducement charge of $3.4 million. In fiscal 2015, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $10.5 million, which comprised the majority of the loss in fiscal 2015. This was also a non-cash charge to operations. Loss per share attributable to common shareholders for fiscal 2016 was ($0.84) compared with loss per share attributable to common shareholders of ($3.88) for fiscal 2015.\nHighlights of Fiscal 2016\n \u25cf Subscription and perpetual license revenue increased 5% to $6.1 million for fiscal 2016. \n \u25cf Licenses and Managed Hosting comprised 46% of revenue in fiscal 2016 compared to 38% in fiscal 2015 \n \u25cf Cost of revenue decreased $3.8 million reflecting our commitment to align costs to revenue expectations. \n \u25cf Gross Margin improved to 54% in fiscal 2016 compared to 43% in fiscal 2015. \n \u25cf Excluding the goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2015, operating expenses decreased $1.6 million also reflecting our cost control initiatives. \n \u25cf We significantly reduced our debt. We reduced our convertible debt and term notes from $6 million to zero by converting all debt to equity. \n \u25cf In 2016, CIO Review selected iAPPS as one of the 20 Most Promising Digital Marketing Solution Providers. \n\nRevenue\nTotal revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 decreased $3.3 million, or 17%, to $15.9 million from $19.2 million in fiscal 2015. Our revenue is derived from three sources: (i) digital engagement services; (ii) subscription and perpetual licenses; and (iii) managed service hosting.\nDigital Engagement Services\nDigital engagement services revenue is comprised of iAPPS digital engagement services and other digital engagement services generated from non-iAPPS related engagements. Total revenue from digital engagement services decreased $3.4 million, or 28% to $8.5 million in fiscal 2016 from $11.9 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease in digital engagement services revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to the prior period is due primarily to a decrease in larger value iAPPS engagements.\nDigital engagement services revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 54% in fiscal 2016 from 62% in fiscal 2015. The decrease is attributable to the decrease in the number of iAPPS license related engagements and lower margin iAPPSds engagements. The Company has also been focused on selling iAPPS engagements that have a smaller services component which results in a shorter sales cycle and a shorter implementation cycle. This has strategically decreased the percentage of service revenue compared to total revenue and increased the percentage of license revenue to total revenue.\nSubscription and Perpetual Licenses\nRevenue from subscription (SaaS) and perpetual licenses increased $292 thousand, or 5% to $6.1 million in fiscal 2016 from $5.8 million in fiscal 2015. Subscription and perpetual license revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 38% in fiscal 2016 from 30% in fiscal 2015. The increases are due primarily to a higher concentration of iAPPS subscription license revenues and a decrease in perpetual licenses.\nManaged Service Hosting\nRevenue from managed service hosting decreased $238 thousand, or 16%, to $1.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $1.5 million in fiscal 2015. The decreases are due to the non-renewal of engagements with smaller hosting customers obtained through previous acquisitions combined with a majority of our new engagements that are SaaS engagements and do not have a separate managed hosting component. Managed services revenue as a percentage of total revenue remained constant at 8% for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015.\nThe decreases are due to most of our new engagements being subscription licenses (SaaS) rather than perpetual licenses, which typically require hosting.\nCost of Revenue\nTotal cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 decreased $3.8 million, or 34%, to $7.3 million from $11.0 million in fiscal 2015.\nCost of Digital Engagement Services\nCost of digital engagement services decreased $3.6 million, or 41%, compared to fiscal 2015. The cost of total digital engagement services as a percentage of total digital engagement services revenue decreased to 60% in fiscal 2016 from 73% in fiscal 2015. The decreases are attributable to aligning labor costs with expected revenues and the focus on reducing our facility and overhead costs.\nCost of Subscription and Perpetual License\nCost of subscription and perpetual licenses decreased $159 thousand or 8% to $1.8 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $2.0 million in fiscal 2015. The cost of subscription and perpetual licenses as a percentage of subscription and perpetual license revenue decreased to 30% in fiscal 2016 from 34% in fiscal 2015. The decreases are due to the cessation of amortization costs related to the capitalization of software partially offset by fixed costs to support our network operations center.\nCost of Managed Service Hosting\nCost of managed service hosting decreased $3 thousand or 1% in fiscal 2016 to $304 thousand compared to $307 thousand in fiscal 2015. The cost of managed services as a percentage of managed services revenue increased to 24% in fiscal 2016 from 20% in fiscal 2015. The percentage increase is attributable to maintaining a certain level of fixed costs to support the network operations center.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased $428 thousand, or 5% in fiscal 2016 to $8.6 million compared to $8.2 million in fiscal 2015. The increase is primarily attributable to the increase in iAPPS SaaS licenses revenue. The increase is related to a higher percentage of our revenue coming from license and managed service hosting, as well as the result of a number of improvements we have made with our facilities and services organization.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $826 thousand, or 14% to $4.9 million in fiscal 2016 from $5.8 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in headcount and facility costs and travel related expenditures, partially offset by increases in marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue increased to 31% in fiscal 2016 compared to 30% in fiscal 2015. The increase as a percentage of total revenue is attributable to the decrease in overall revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $479 thousand, or 12% to $3.5 million in fiscal 2016 from $3.9 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease is attributable to decreases in compensation related expenses and legal expenses. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue increased to 22% in fiscal 2016 compared to 20% in fiscal 2015. The increase as a percentage of revenue is attributable to the decrease in revenues.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense decreased by $323 thousand, or 17% to $1.6 million in fiscal 2016 from $1.9 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 is attributable to a decrease in compensation related costs. In order to compensate for headcount reduction in services, employees from our development group assisted the delivery team to maintain certain production schedules and their costs were charged to cost of digital engagement services. Research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue was 10% for both periods.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $386 thousand, or 23% to $1.3 million in fiscal 2016 from $1.7 million in fiscal 2015. This decrease is primarily attributable to retirement of fixed assets in relation to a reduction of office space during fiscal 2016 and a reduction in capital expenditure purchases in fiscal 2016. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 8% in fiscal 2016 from 9% in fiscal 2015.\nGoodwill Impairment\nWe performed our annual assessment of goodwill for both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. We concluded that there was no impairment loss for 2016. In 2015, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting unit were less than their carrying amounts and that there should be an impairment loss. We determined that the most appropriate approach to use to determine the fair value of the reporting unit was the discounted cash flow method. A comparison to the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value resulted in an impairment charge of $10.5 million for fiscal 2015.\nRestructuring Expenses\nDuring the second half of fiscal 2015 and through fiscal 2016, the Company's management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies by implementing cost reductions in line with the expected decrease in revenues. The Company renegotiated several office leases. We entered in into sub-leases for the original space and moved to new less expensive leases or vacated the office space entirely. In addition, the Company executed a general work-force reduction in fiscal 2015 and recognized costs for severance and termination benefits. These restructuring charges and accruals require estimates and assumptions, including contractual rental commitments or lease buy-outs for vacated office space and related costs, and estimated sub-lease income. The Company's sub-lease assumptions include the rates to be charged to a sub-tenant and the timing of the sub-lease arrangement. These estimates and assumptions will be monitored on a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances with the corresponding adjustments reflected in the consolidated statement of operations.\nIn total, a charge of $879 and $496 was recorded to restructuring expenses for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 in the consolidated statement of operations for the total lease expenses less sub-lease rental income, other miscellaneous lease termination costs, loss on disposal of fixed assets, and costs for severance and termination benefits.\nLoss from Operations\nThe loss from operations was ($3.5) million for fiscal 2016 compared to a loss from operations of ($16.1) million for fiscal 2015. The decrease in iAPPS related digital engagement services revenue in fiscal 2016 was partially offset by the reduction in cost of revenue and operating expenses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded a net benefit for income tax expense of $47 thousand for fiscal 2016 compared to a net benefit for income tax of $226 thousand for fiscal 2015. The benefit in 2015 was primarily attributable to the elimination of a naked tax credit related to deductible goodwill from previous acquisitions that was eliminated upon recording a $10.5 million goodwill impairment charge. Income tax expense represents the estimated liability for Federal, state and foreign income taxes owed by the Company, including the alternative minimum tax. The Company has net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax benefits that are available to offset future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company has established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2016 and 2015.\nThe Federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforward of approximately $26.0 million as of September 30, 2016 expires on various dates through 2036. Internal Revenue Code Section 382 places a limitation on the amount of taxable income which can be offset by NOL carryforwards after a change in control of a loss corporation. Generally, after a change in control, a loss corporation cannot deduct NOL carryforwards in excess of the Section 382 limitation. Due to these change of ownership\u201d provisions, utilization of NOL carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods. The Company has not performed a Section 382 analysis. However, if performed, Section 382 may be found to limit potential future utilization of our NOL carryforwards.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe also measure our performance based on a non-GAAP ( Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\u201d) measurement of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and before inducement of debt charges, stock-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and restructuring charges ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d).\nWe believe this non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to management and investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented and provides a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA, however, is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP profitability measures such as (i) income from operations and net income, or (ii) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, both as determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure has material limitations since it excludes the financial statement impact of income taxes, net interest expense, loss on inducement of debt, amortization of intangibles, depreciation, goodwill impairment, restructuring charges, other amortization and stock-based compensation, and therefore does not represent an accurate measure of profitability. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income for a complete analysis of our profitability, as net income includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable GAAP operating performance measure to Adjusted EBITDA. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may also differ from and therefore may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of the limitations that Adjusted EBITDA has as an analytical tool, investors should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP.\nThe following table reconciles net loss (which is the most directly comparable GAAP operating performance measure) to EBITDA, and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was ($785) thousand for fiscal 2016 compared with ($2.6) million for fiscal 2015. This was primarily due to the improvement in gross margin along with our focus on reducing our expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities was $2.7 million for fiscal 2016, compared to cash used in operating activities of $2.8 million for fiscal 2015. Although the net loss was reduced in fiscal 2016, we used funds to pay down accounts payable.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $165 thousand for fiscal 2016 compared with $187 thousand for fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily due to less purchases of capital equipment and software in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $3.2 million for fiscal 2016 compared with $2.1 million for fiscal 2015. The increase was due to proceeds from the sale of common stock of $3.7 million and $1 million in term notes from a shareholder offset by payments made on bank term loans, our bank line of credit and contingent acquisition payments. At September 30, 2016, we had an outstanding balance under our credit line with Heritage Bank of $2.1 million.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity Outlook\nIn June 2016, the Company entered into a new Loan and Security Agreement with Heritage Bank of Commerce ( Loan Agreement\u201d). The Loan Agreement has a term of 24 months and will expire on June 9, 2018. The Loan Agreement currently provides for $2.5 million of revolving credit advances and may be used for acquisitions and working capital purposes. The credit advances may not exceed the monthly borrowing base capacity, which will fluctuate based on monthly accounts receivable balances. The Company may request credit advances if the borrowing capacity is more than the current outstanding loan advance, and must pay down the outstanding loan advance if it exceeds the borrowing capacity. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an outstanding balance under the Loan Agreement of $2.1 million.\nIn November 2016, we entered into Securities Purchase Agreements with certain institutional and accredited investors to sell an aggregate total of 2,135,362 shares of our common stock for $0.48 per share ( November Private Placement\u201d). In total, we received net proceeds of $987 thousand. The proceeds will be used to fund current and future operations.\nWe believe that the proceeds from the November Private Placement, cash generated from operations, and borrowing capacity from the Heritage Bank line of credit will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs in the foreseeable future. However, we currently have a borrowing facility with Heritage Bank from which we can borrow, and this line is subject to financial covenants that must be met. It is not certain that all or part of this line will be available to us in the future; and other sources of financing may not be available to us in a timely basis if at all, or on terms acceptable to us. If we fail to obtain acceptable funding when needed, we may not have sufficient resources to fund our normal operations, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInflation\nInflationary increases can cause pressure on wages and the cost of benefits offered to employees. We believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, other than our operating leases and contingent acquisition payments.\nWe currently do not have any variable interest entities. We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Therefore, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships.\nContractual Obligations\nWe lease our facilities in the United States and India. Other contractual obligations include: (i) certain equipment acquired under capitalized lease agreements and (ii) contingent earnouts in the amount of $75 thousand payable in cash on the achievement of revenue and earnings targets. We have no future commitments that extend past fiscal 2020.\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations:\n\n (a) Net of sublease income (b) The contingent acquisition payments are maximum potential earn-out consideration payable to former owners of acquired companies. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThese critical accounting policies and estimates by our management should be read in conjunction with Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP\u201d).\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance US GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. The most significant estimates included in our financial statements are the valuation of accounts receivable and long-term assets, including intangibles, goodwill and deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation, amounts of revenue to be recognized on service contracts in progress, unbilled receivables, and deferred revenue. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment:\n\nRevenue Recognition\nOverview\nThe Company enters into arrangements to sell digital engagement services (professional services), software licenses or combinations thereof. Revenue is categorized into (i) digital engagement services; (ii) managed service hosting; and (iii) subscriptions and perpetual licenses.\nThe Company recognizes revenue as required by the Revenue Recognition Topic of the Codification. Revenue is generally recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) delivery has occurred or the services have been provided to the customer; (3) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of the fees is reasonably assured. Billings made or payments received in advance of providing services are deferred until the period these services are provided.\nThe Company maintains a reseller channel to supplement our direct sales force for our iAPPS platform. Resellers are generally located in territories where the Company does not have a direct sales force. Customers generally sign a license agreement directly with us. Revenue from perpetual licenses sold through resellers is recognized upon delivery to the end user as long as evidence of an arrangement exists, collectability is probable, and the fee is fixed and determinable. Revenue for subscription licenses is recognized monthly as the services are delivered.\nDigital Engagement Services\nDigital engagement services include professional services primarily related to the Company's web development solutions that address specific customer needs such as digital strategy, information architecture and usability engineering, .Net development, rich media development, back end integration, search engine optimization, quality assurance and project management.\nDigital engagement services are contracted for on either a fixed price or time and materials basis. For its fixed price engagements, after assigning the relative selling price to the elements of the arrangement, the Company applies the proportional performance model (if not subject to contract accounting) to recognize revenue based on cost incurred in relation to total estimated cost at completion. The Company has determined that labor costs are the most appropriate measure to allocate revenue among reporting periods, as they are the primary input when providing application development services. Customers are invoiced monthly or upon the completion of milestones. For milestone based projects, since milestone pricing is based on expected hourly costs and the duration of such engagements is relatively short, this input approach principally mirrors an output approach under the proportional performance model for revenue recognition on such fixed priced engagements. For time and materials contracts, revenues are recognized as the services are provided.\nDigital engagement services also include retained professional services contracted for on an on call\u201d basis or for a certain amount of hours each month. Such arrangements generally provide for a guaranteed availability of a number of professional services hours each month on a use it or lose it\u201d basis. For retained professional services sold on a stand-alone basis the Company recognizes revenue as the services are delivered or over the term of the contractual retainer period. These arrangements do not require formal customer acceptance and do not grant any future right to labor hours contracted for but not used.\nSubscriptions and Perpetual Licenses\nThe Company licenses its software on either a perpetual or subscription basis. Customers who license the software on a perpetual basis receive rights to use the software for an indefinite time period and an option to purchase Post-Customer Support ( PCS\u201d). For arrangements that consist of a perpetual license and PCS, as long as Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ( VSOE\u201d) exists for the PCS, then PCS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the period of performance and the perpetual license is recognized on a residual basis. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements are deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and recognized as revenue, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nCustomers may also license the software on a subscription basis, which can be described as Software as a Service\u201d or SaaS\u201d. SaaS is a model of software deployment where an application is hosted as a service provided to customers across the Internet. Subscription agreements include access to the Company's software application via an internet connection, the related hosting of the application, and PCS. Customers receive automatic updates and upgrades, and new releases of the products as soon as they become available. Customers cannot take possession of the software. Subscription agreements are either annual or month-to-month arrangements that provide for termination for convenience by either party upon 90 days' notice. Revenue is recognized monthly as the services are delivered. Set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription services are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the life of subscription period or the expected lives of customer relationships. The Company continues to evaluate the length of the amortization period of the set up fees as it gains more experience with customer contract renewals.\nManaged Service Hosting\nManaged service hosting includes hosting arrangements that provide for the use of certain hardware and infrastructure for those customers who do not wish to host our applications independently. Hosting agreements are either annual or month-to-month arrangements that provide for termination for convenience by either party generally upon 30-days' notice. Revenue is recognized monthly as the hosting services are delivered. Set up fees paid by customers in connection with managed hosting services are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the hosting period or the expected lives of customer relationships. The Company continues to evaluate the length of the amortization period of the set up fees as it gains more experience with customer contract renewals.\nMultiple Element Arrangements\nIn accounting for multiple element arrangements, the Company follows either ASC Topic 605-985 Revenue Recognition Software or ASC Topic 605-25 Revenue Recognition Multiple Element Arrangements, as applicable.\nIn October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition: Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements ( ASU 2009-13\u201d). ASU 2009-13 provides amendments to certain paragraphs of previously issued ASC Subtopic 605-25 - Revenue Recognition: Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. In accordance with ASU 2009-13, each deliverable within a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met (1) the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and (2) for an arrangement that includes a right of return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the delivered item is considered probable and within our control. If the deliverables do not meet the criteria for being a separate unit of accounting then they are combined with a deliverable that does meet that criterion. The accounting guidance also requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. The accounting guidance also establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. The Company determines selling price using VSOE, if it exists; otherwise, it uses Third-party Evidence ( TPE\u201d). If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a unit of accounting, the Company uses Estimated Selling Price ( ESP\u201d).\nVSOE is generally limited to the price at which the Company sells the element in a separate stand-alone transaction. TPE is determined based on the prices charged by our competitors for a similar deliverable when sold separately. It is difficult for us to obtain sufficient information on competitor pricing, so we may not be able to substantiate TPE. If the Company cannot establish selling price based on VSOE or TPE then it will use ESP. ESP is derived by considering the selling price for similar services and our ongoing pricing strategies. The selling prices used in allocations of arrangement consideration are analyzed at minimum on an annual basis and more frequently if business necessitates a more timely review. The Company has determined that it has VSOE on its SaaS offerings, certain application development services, managed hosting services, and PCS because it has evidence of these elements sold on a stand-alone basis.\nWhen the Company licenses its software on a perpetual basis in a multiple element arrangement that arrangement typically includes PCS and application development services, we follow the guidance of ASC Topic 605-985. In assessing the hierarchy of relative selling price for PCS, we have determined that VSOE is established for PCS. VSOE for PCS is based on the price of PCS when sold separately, which has been established via annual renewal rates. Similarly, when the Company licenses its software on a perpetual basis in a multiple element arrangement that also includes managed service hosting ( hosting\u201d), we have determined that VSOE is established for hosting based on the price of the hosting when sold separately, which has been established based on renewal rates of the hosting contract. Revenue recognition for perpetual licenses sold with application development services are considered on a case by case basis. The Company has not established VSOE for perpetual licenses or fixed price development services and therefore in accordance with ASC Topic 605-985, when perpetual licenses are sold in multiple element arrangements including application development services where VSOE for the services has not been established, the license revenue is deferred and recognized using contract accounting. The Company has determined that services are not essential to the functionality of the software and it has the ability to make estimates necessary to apply proportional performance model. In those cases where perpetual licenses are sold in a multiple element arrangement that includes application development services where VSOE for the services has been established, the license revenue is recognized under the residual method and the application services are recognized upon delivery.\nIn determining VSOE for the digital engagement services element, the separability of the services from the software license and the value of the services when sold on a standalone basis are considered. The Company also considers the categorization of the services, the timing of when the services contract was signed in relation to the signing of the perpetual license contract and delivery of the software, and whether the services can be performed by others. The Company has concluded that its application development services are not required for the customer to use the product but, rather enhance the benefits that the software can bring to the customer. In addition, the services provided do not result in significant customization or modification of the software and are not essential to its functionality, and can also be performed by the customer or a third party. If an application development services arrangement does qualify for separate accounting, the Company recognizes the perpetual license on a residual basis. If an application development services arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting, the Company recognizes the perpetual license under the proportional performance model as described above.\nWhen subscription arrangements are sold with application development services, the Company uses its judgment as to whether the application development services qualify as a separate unit of accounting. When subscription service arrangements involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting, the Company allocates arrangement consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables based on the relative selling price model in accordance with the selling price hierarchy, which includes: (i) VSOE when available; (ii) TPE if VSOE is not available; and (iii) ESP if neither VSOE or TPE is available. For those subscription arrangements sold with multiple elements whereby the application development services do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting, the application services revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period. Subscriptions also include a PCS component, and the Company has determined that the two elements cannot be separated and must be recognized as one unit over the applicable service period. Set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription arrangements are deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the life of the hosting period or the expected lives of customer relationships, which generally range from two to three years. The Company continues to evaluate the length of the amortization period of the set up fees as it gains more experience with customer contract renewals and our newer product offerings.\nCustomer Payment Terms\nPayment terms with customers typically require payment 30 days from invoice date. Payment terms may vary by customer but generally do not exceed 45 days from invoice date. Invoicing for digital engagement services are either monthly or upon achievement of milestones and payment terms for such billings are within the standard terms described above. Invoicing for subscriptions and hosting are typically issued monthly and are generally due in the month of service. The Company's subscription and hosting agreements provide for refunds when service is interrupted for an extended period of time and are reserved for in the month in which they occur if necessary.\nOur digital engagement services agreements with customers do not provide for any refunds for services or products and therefore no specific reserve for such is maintained. In the infrequent instances where customers raise a concern over delivered products or services, we have endeavored to remedy the concern and all costs related to such matters have been insignificant in all periods presented.\nWarranty\nCertain arrangements include a warranty period, which is generally 30 days from the completion of work. In hosting arrangements, we provide warranties of up-time reliability. We continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the warranties to identify if a warranty claim may arise. If we determine that a warranty claim is probable, then any related cost to satisfy the warranty obligation is estimated and accrued. Warranty claims to date have been immaterial.\nReimbursable Expenses\nIn connection with certain arrangements, reimbursable expenses are incurred and billed to customers and such amounts are recognized as both revenue and cost of revenue.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which represents estimated losses resulting from the inability, failure or refusal of our clients to make required payments.\nWe analyze historical percentages of uncollectible accounts and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We use an internal collection effort, which may include our sales and services groups as we deem appropriate. Although we believe that our allowances are adequate, if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if we underestimate the allowances required, additional allowances may be necessary, resulting in increased expense in the period in which such determination is made.\nAccounting for Cost of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed\nWe charge research and development expenditures for technology development to operations as incurred. However, in accordance with Codification 985-20 Costs of Software to be Sold Leased or Otherwise Marketed, we capitalize certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. Based on our product development process, technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model. Certain costs incurred between completion of a working model and the point at which the product is ready for general release is capitalized if significant. Once the product is available for general release, the capitalized costs are amortized in cost of sales.\nAccounting for Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of every year and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. In assessing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We assess goodwill at the consolidated level as one reporting unit. If this is the case, then performing the quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. An entity can choose not to perform a qualitative assessment for any or all of its reporting units, and proceed directly to the use of the two-step impairment test. In assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we assess relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of a reporting unit. The identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting unit's fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments by management. These judgments include the consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, events which are specific to Bridgeline, and trends in the market price of our common stock. Each factor is assessed to determine whether it impacts the impairment test positively or negatively, and the magnitude of any such impact.\nFor fiscal 2016, the Company performed the annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2016 and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were less than their carrying amounts. In estimating fair value, the Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis on the reporting unit to determine fair value. The inputs to the discounted cash flow model are considered level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The impairment test performed by the Company indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was more than its corresponding carrying amount. As a result of the analyses performed, the Company assessed that goodwill was not impaired.\nFor fiscal 2015, the Company performed the annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2015, using the qualitative approach described above. Based on the qualitative assessment, the Company concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units were less than their carrying amounts. While there were numerous positive qualitative factors discovered during the qualitative analysis, the instability of the market price of the Company's common stock and the decline in revenues were significant adverse factors that directed a full assessment. (See Note 7) In estimating fair value, the Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis on the reporting unit to determine fair value. The inputs to the discounted cash flow model are considered level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The impairment test performed by the Company indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its corresponding carrying amount. As a result of the analyses performed, the Company recorded goodwill impairment charges of $10.5 million in 2015.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nAt September 30, 2016, we maintained two stock-based compensation plans, one of which has expired but still contains vested and unvested stock options. The two plans are more fully described in Note 12 of these consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with the Compensation-Stock Topic of the Codification. Share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values.\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for share-based payments issued or assumed after October 1, 2006 that are expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally three years. We recognize the fair value of the unvested portion of share-based payments granted prior to October 1, 2006 over the remaining service period, net of estimated forfeitures. In determining whether an award is expected to vest, we use an estimated, forward-looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rate and reduce the expense over the recognition period. Estimated forfeiture rates are updated for actual forfeitures quarterly. We also consider, each quarter, whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our forfeiture rate. Although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. In addition, to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true-up for the difference in the period that the awards vest, and such true-ups could materially affect our operating results.\nWe estimate the fair value of employee stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon United States treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the historical volatility of our publicly traded options in order to estimate future stock price trends. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we use historical trends of employee turnovers. Our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense we record to vary.\nWe record deferred tax assets for stock-based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction.", "item_7_tables": "Table 41: <table> <tr> <td> RESULTS OF

"The Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of the report covers forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results of the company to materially differ from anticipated outcomes. These risks include the effects of economic weakness, ineffective growth management, revenue volatility, competitive pressures, stock market volatility, ability to raise capital, product performance, rapid technology and customer requirement changes, proprietary technology protection, dependence on key personnel, and internal control effectiveness.\n\nThe company, Bridgeline Digital, provides a digital engagement platform called iAPPS, comprising Web Content Management, eCommerce, eMarketing, Social Media management, and Web Analytics to enhance online customer experiences and improve revenue, customer service, knowledge, and operational efficiency. They also offer a subscription-based product, iAPPSds, tailored for franchise and dealer networks, and the iAPPSdsr, targeting organizations with multiple locations.\n\niAPPS is cloud-based, available as both Software as a Service (SaaS) and perpetual licensing, and has won numerous awards globally for its performance as a digital marketing solution. Bridgeline Digital was founded in 2000 and operates from its Massachusetts headquarters with several regional offices across the U.S. and a subsidiary in India.\n\nSales and marketing efforts focus on medium-sized and large companies across various industries, with sales cycles for their services ranging from 2 to 6 months. The company also forms strategic alliances to enhance sales and distribution, such as a multi-year agreement with UPS Logistics for eCommerce solutions.\n\nGiven its potential growth strategy, Bridgeline Digital may acquire other companies to expand its customer base, salesforce, and developer team, and improve operating results by integrating finance, HR, and other business functions. Over the year ending September 30, 2016, a significant portion of revenue came from a single customer.\n\nRevenue has decreased from $19.2 million in 2015 to $15.9 million in 2016, with losses reducing from $16.1 million to $3.5 million over the same period, in part due to a decrease in goodwill impairment charges from $10.5 million to none. Gross margin improved, and debt was reduced by converting it to equity.\n\nThe financial statements, prepared according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, detail revenue distribution, the cost of revenue, gross profit, and operating expenses. Operating losses, net losses, and adjusted EBITDA are all measured, with a net loss of $7.8 million in 2016 compared to $16.8 million in 2015.\n\nCash from operations, investing, and financing activities are reviewed, along with discussions on capital resources, liquidity, inflation effects, off-balance sheet arrangements, and contractual obligations. Critical accounting policies and estimates, such as revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts, capitalized software costs, goodwill and intangible assets accounting, and stock-based compensation accounting, are also discussed.\n\n[Due to the length and detail of the initial report, this summary focuses on key components of the MD&A and related financial and operational points. Some specific numeric and percentage values have not been elaborated in the interest of brevity.]"}
