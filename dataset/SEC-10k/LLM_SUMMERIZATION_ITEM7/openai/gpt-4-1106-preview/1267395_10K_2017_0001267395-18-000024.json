Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related Notes contained in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and particularly under the headings Risk Factors,\u201d Business\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d contained in Item 1A, Item 1, and Part I of this report, respectively.\nAspen's Year in Review\nThe insurance and reinsurance industry continued to be challenged in 2017 as a result of the impact of a series of costly catastrophe events and losses. In addition, although rates generally increased following the catastrophes in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, the industry has experienced years of rate reductions across many lines of business in both insurance and reinsurance.\nBusiness Portfolio Optimization. In 2017, we launched a comprehensive program to enhance operating effectiveness and efficiency across our organization and enhance our market position (the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program\u201d). The Effectiveness and Efficiency Program is intended to allow us to be a more nimble organization with faster decision-making ability and a more competitive expense ratio.\nWe expect the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program to deliver cumulative total expense savings of approximately $160 million over the next three years. We expect to achieve approximately $30 million of the savings in 2018, $55 million in 2019 and $75 million in 2020, after which run-rate savings are expected to be approximately $80 million per year. We expect approximately 70% of the total expected savings to benefit our Insurance segment. We likewise expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $95 million to implement the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program and achieve the expected savings, the majority of which we expect will be incurred in 2018 and 2019. Approximately $50 million of this charge is for employee severance, benefits and related expenses, $30 million for business transformation and Effectiveness and Efficiency Program costs, and $15 million for outsourcing and premises. We also expect to spend a total of approximately $55 million in incremental capital expenditure, primarily information technology, in 2018 and 2019 that we expect to be amortized over a period of three to five years from the start of 2020. In 2017, we have recognized $15.2 million of expense associated with the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program.\nIn our insurance segment, we experienced a significant underwriting loss due to a combination of catastrophe losses and an increased incidence of large losses and attritional losses. Gross written premium for the insurance segment was $1.81 billion in 2017, an increase of 4.5% from 2016. Our combined ratio in insurance was 117.9% in 2017 compared to 99.6% in 2016.\nIn our reinsurance segment, our results were dominated by the significant level of natural catastrophe losses primarily in the U.S. Gross written premium for the reinsurance segment for 2017 was $1.55 billion, an increase of 9.6% from 2016, with growth primarily in specialty lines. The combined ratio was 125.1% in 2017 compared to 90.0% in 2016.\nOn December 18, 2017, the Company acquired through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Aspen U.S. Holdings, a 23.2% share of Crop Re Services LLC ( Crop Re\u201d), a newly formed U.S.-based subsidiary of CGB Diversified Services, Inc ( CGB DS\u201d) in exchange for the sale of AG Logic Holdings, LLC and its affiliates ( AgriLogic\u201d), the Company's U.S. crop insurance business. For further information regarding this transaction, see Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements, Investments.\u201d\nTotal ceded written premiums in 2017 increased by $595.1 million compared to 2016. Ceded written premiums increased in both our insurance and reinsurance segments due to the purchase of a whole account quota share contract. Ceded reinsurance premiums increased for our insurance segment due to the restructure of our ceded reinsurance arrangements through the use of significant quota share reinsurance arrangements and the recognition of ceded premiums to reinstate cover following catastrophe and other large losses. Ceded premiums also increased in the reinsurance segment due to increased gross written premiums written in conjunction with increased retrocession to third parties, an increase in ceded reinsurance premiums following the sale of AgriLogic in December 2017 and due to the recognition of additional ceded premiums as a result of reinstating cover following catastrophe losses.\nCapital Management. We continue to focus on capital management and maintain our capital at an appropriate level. In 2017, we repurchased 648,941 ordinary shares for a total consideration of $30.0 million. In addition, in the second quarter of 2017, we increased our quarterly dividend on our ordinary shares from $0.22 to $0.24 per ordinary share. On February 8, 2017, our Board of Directors also authorized a new share repurchase program of $250.0 million. The share repurchase authorization, which is effective through February 8, 2019, permits us to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of transactions.\nOn January 3, 2017, we also elected to redeem all of the outstanding 7.401% Preference Shares. Each holder of a 7.401% Preference Share received $25 per 7.401% Preference Share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends. We likewise elected to redeem all of the outstanding 7.250% Preference Shares on July 3, 2017. Each holder of a 7.250% Preference Share received $25 per 7.250% Preference Share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends.\nInvestment Management. We follow an investment strategy designed to emphasize the preservation of capital and provide sufficient liquidity for the prompt payment of claims. As of December 31, 2017, our investments consisted of a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities including U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt, global equities and money market funds. Our overall portfolio strategy remains focused on high quality fixed income investments. In the third quarter of 2017, we took advantage of rising equity markets and sold $208.1 million of our equity portfolio. Proceeds from the sales were reinvested into a core fixed income strategy. As at December 31, 2017, we had a 5.8% (2016 -6.8%) position in equities, a 4% (2016 - 3.8%) position in U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt and 0.2% (2016 -0.2%) in risk asset portfolio cash. As at December 31, 2017, approximately 10% of our total cash and investments, excluding catastrophe bonds and funds held by variable interest entities (the Managed Portfolio\u201d), was invested in equities and U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt (2016 - 10.8%).\nFinancial Overview\nThe following overview of our 2017, 2016 and 2015 operating results and financial condition is intended to identify important themes and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion further below.\nOperating highlights\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Gross written premiums of $3,360.9 million in 2017, an increase of 6.8% from 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Combined ratio of 125.7% for 2017, including $561.9 million, or 24.6 percentage points of pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatements, compared with 98.5% for 2016, which included $164.4 million or 6.3 percentage points of pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatements, and 91.9% for 2015, which included $90.5 million or 3.7 percentage points of pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net favorable development on prior year loss reserves of $105.4 million, or 4.6 combined ratio points, for 2017 compared with $129.3 million, or 4.9 combined ratio points, for 2016, and $156.5 million, or 6.3 combined ratio points, for 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Annualized net return on average equity of an 11.1% loss for 2017 compared with a 5.4% gain in 2016 and a 10.0% gain in 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Gross written premiums.

The 4.5% increase in gross written premiums in our insurance segment in 2017 was due to growth in financial and professional lines insurance. Overall gross written premiums in 2017 increased by 6.8%. In 2016 gross written premiums increased by 5.0% compared to 2015 due primarily to growth in specialty reinsurance and casualty reinsurance business lines.\nCeded written premiums. Ceded written premiums in 2017 increased by 107.6% compared to 2016. The changes in our segments' ceded written premiums for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ceded Written Premiums for the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>298.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>849.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>409.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,148.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>553.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>351.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCeded written premiums increased in both segments due to the combination of the purchase of a whole account quota share contract in the first quarter of 2017 in addition to increased use of quota share reinsurance, particularly in the insurance segment. Ceded written premiums increased in our insurance segment due to the restructuring of our ceded reinsurance arrangements and the recognition of reinstatement premiums associated with the increase in catastrophe and large losses. Ceded written premiums increased in our reinsurance segment due to new business opportunities written in conjunction with increased retrocession, additional ceded written premiums following the sale of AgriLogic in December 2017 and the recognition of reinstatement premiums associated with the increase in catastrophe losses.\nCeded written premiums increased by 57.6% in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of new business opportunities written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession, and as a result of a restructure of our ceded reinsurance arrangements aimed at reducing earnings volatility and benefiting the expense ratio through an increase in over-rider commissions.\nCombined ratio. We monitor the ratio of losses and expenses to net earned premium (the combined ratio\u201d) as a measure of relative performance where a lower ratio represents a better result than a higher ratio. The combined ratios for our two business segments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Combined Ratios for the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The total combined ratio includes the impact from corporate expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The combined ratio for 2017 increased by 27.2 percentage points compared to 2016 due mainly to the increase in the loss ratio. The increase in loss ratio was due primarily to a $409.6 million increase in catastrophe losses, a $59.7 million increase in large losses, a $23.9 million decrease in prior year reserve releases, an increase in attritional losses in our insurance segment and a $330.7 million decrease in net earned premiums. The expense ratio increased by 0.5 percentage point due to a reduction in net earned premiums and an increase in general, administrative and corporate expenses partially offset by a decrease in policy acquisition expenses due to over-rider commissions associated with the increase in ceded reinsurance.\nThe combined ratio for 2016 increased by 6.6 percentage points compared to 2015 due to a 4.6 percentage point increase in the loss ratio and a 2.0 percentage point increase in the expense ratio. The loss ratio increase was due primarily to a $75.9 million increase in catastrophe losses and a $27.2 million reduction in the level of prior year reserve releases. The increase in expense ratio was due to higher acquisition and general administrative and corporate expenses. The increase in the expense ratio was due to an increase in the acquisition ratio due to higher profit commission accruals and lower ceding commissions in the insurance segment and changes in business mix in the reinsurance segment. The increase in general, administrative and corporate expenses was due to costs associated with AgriLogic, growth in our insurance and reinsurance business and reorganization costs.\nIn each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a reduction in the level of reserves for prior years. In 2017, we reported net favorable development on prior year loss reserves of $105.4 million, or 4.6 combined ratio points, compared with $129.3 million, or 4.9 combined ratio points, for 2016, and $156.5 million, or 6.3 combined ratio points, for 2015.\nOverall reserve releases in 2017 decreased by $23.9 million compared to 2016 mainly due to an $18.7 million decrease in net reserve releases in our insurance segment from $42.3 million in 2016 to $23.6 million in 2017. Overall reserve releases in 2016 reduced by $27.2 million compared to 2015 due mainly to a $23.4 million decrease in net reserve releases in our insurance segment from $65.7 million in 2015 to $42.3 million in 2016. Reserve releases in our reinsurance segment in 2015 decreased from $90.8 million in 2015 to $87.0 million in 2016. Further information relating to the release of reserves can be found below under - Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Prior Year Loss Reserves.\u201d\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to an increase in over-rider commissions associated with the increase in ceded reinsurance. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased in 2016 compared to 2015 in line with premium growth and higher profit commission accruals and lower ceding commissions in the insurance segment offsetting the Federal Excise Tax ( FET\u201d) refunds and changes in business mix in the reinsurance segment.\nGeneral, administrative and corporate expenses increased to $502.2 million in 2017 from $490.1 million in 2016 and $424.0 million in 2015. The increase in such expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was largely due to $15.2 million of costs associated with the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program and increased costs associated with growth in our insurance business partially offset by lower provisions for performance-related remuneration. The increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was largely due to costs associated with AgriLogic which we acquired in January 2016 (and subsequently sold in December 2017), costs associated with growth in our insurance and reinsurance business and reorganization costs.\nNet investment income. We generated net investment income of $189.0 million in 2017, an increase of 1.0% on the prior year (2016 - $187.1 million; 2015 - $185.5 million). The increase was primarily due to the increase in the book yield of the fixed income portfolio. The increase in investment income in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a higher investment balance and $20.4 million of dividend income from our global equity securities portfolio compared with $20.1 million in 2015.\nTaxes. We recognized a tax credit in 2017 of $15.4 million (2016 - $6.1 million expense; 2015 - $14.4 million expense), equivalent to a consolidated rate on our loss before tax of 5.5% in 2017 compared to a consolidated rate on our profit before tax of 2.9% in 2016 and 4.3% in 2015. The income tax credit for 2017 takes into account a tax credit associated with the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d and a tax credit regarding deductions available for certain research and development expenditure. The tax credit in 2017 has not been materially affected by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was\nsigned on December 22, 2017. The impact of the U.S. federal income tax rate reduction from 34% to 21% has been reflected in measuring deferred taxes.\nThe effective tax rate for the year is subject to revision in future periods if circumstances change and depends on the relative profitability of the business underwritten in Bermuda (where the rate of tax on corporate profits is zero), the United Kingdom (where the corporation tax rate is 19% and will be reduced to 17% effective April 1, 2020) and the United States (where the federal income tax rate was previously 34% and has been reduced to 21% effective January 1, 2018). The tax in each of the years is representative of the geographic spread of our business between taxable and non-taxable jurisdictions in such years.\nNet income. We reported a net loss after taxes of $266.4 million in 2017 compared to net income of $203.4 million in 2016 and net income of $323.1 million in 2015. The net loss in 2017 was primarily due to the $625.5 million decrease in underwriting income resulting mainly from a $409.6 million increase in catastrophe losses, a $330.7 million reduction in net earned premiums and a $23.9 million reduction in reserve releases, partially offset by a $116.3 million reduction in expenses. The decrease in income after tax in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to a $137.7 million decrease in underwriting income resulting from higher catastrophe losses, lower reserve releases and increased expenses partially offset by growth in premiums earned.\nOther comprehensive income. Total other comprehensive income decreased by $50.8 million (2016 - $64.7 million decrease), net of taxes, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. This consists of a net unrealized loss of $9.2 million in the available for sale investment portfolio (2016 - $28.8 million net unrealized loss) largely attributable to the impact of rising interest rates on our bond portfolios, a $3.6 million reclassification of net realized gains to net income (2016 - $8.9 million reclassified realized gains), a $2.6 million unrealized gain (2016 - $0.7 million unrealized gain) on the hedged derivative contracts and an unrealized loss in foreign currency translation of $40.6 million (2016 -$27.7 million unrealized loss) largely attributable to the impact from the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nDividends. In April 2017, the Board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our ordinary shares from $0.22 per ordinary share to $0.24 per ordinary share (2016 - $0.22 quarterly dividend; 2015 - $0.20 quarterly dividend). This resulted in total ordinary dividends for 2017 of $56.2 million (2016 - $52.7 million; 2015 - $50.9 million). Dividends paid on the outstanding Preference Shares in 2017 were $36.2 million (2016 - $41.8 million; 2015 - $37.8 million). The reduction in dividends in 2017 was due to the redemption of the 7.401% and 7.250% Preference Shares.\nShareholders' equity and financial leverage. Total shareholders' equity decreased by $719.8 million from $3,648.3 million as at December 31, 2016 to $2,928.5 million as at December 31, 2017. The most significant movements were:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease of $365.4 million in retained earnings due to the net loss of $266.4 million and the payment of $92.4 million in ordinary and preference share dividends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a reduction of $50.8 million in other comprehensive income;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the redemption of $133.2 million 5,327,500 7.401% Preference Shares;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the redemption of $160.0 million 6,400,000 7.250% Preference Shares; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the repurchase of 648,941 ordinary shares for $30.0 million through open market and other repurchases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> As at December 31, 2017, our total shareholders' equity included Preference Shares with a total value as measured by their respective liquidation preferences of $525.0 million (2016 - $818.2 million) less issue costs of $13.1 million (2016 - $21.1 million).\nOur senior notes were the only material debt issued by Aspen Holdings as at December 31, 2017 and 2016 totaling $549.5 million and $549.3 million, respectively. In addition to the senior notes, we also reported $86.6 million (2016 - $223.4 million) of debt issued by Silverton. For further information relating to Silverton, refer to Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements, Variable Interest Entities.\u201d\nManagement monitors the ratio of the total of debt and hybrids to total capital, with total capital being defined as shareholders' equity plus outstanding debt and excluding loan notes issued by variable interest entities. As at December 31, 2017, the debt to capital ratio was 15.8% (2016 - 13.1%). The ratio increased due to the reduction in our retained earnings as a result of the increase in catastrophe losses impacting both our insurance and reinsurance segments, an increased frequency of large and attritional losses in our insurance segment and the redemption of the 7.401% Preference Shares and 7.250% Preference Shares in 2017. The Preference Shares are classified in our balance sheet as equity but may receive a different treatment in some cases under the capital adequacy assessments made by certain rating agencies. We also monitor the ratio of the total debt and the liquidation preference of our Preference Shares to total capital which was 30.5% as at December 31, 2017 (2016 - 32.1%). The ratio reduced due to the redemption of the 7.401% Preference Shares and 7.250% Preference Shares in 2017.\nDiluted book value per ordinary share as at December 31, 2017 was $40.10, a decrease of 14.2% compared to $46.72 as at December 31, 2016. Book value per ordinary share is based on total shareholders' equity, less preference shares (liquidation preference less issue expenses) and non-controlling interests, divided by the number of ordinary shares in issue at the end of the period.\nBalances as at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As at December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions, except for share amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,928.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,648.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preference shares less issue expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(511.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(797.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net assets attributable to ordinary shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,413.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,849.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issued ordinary shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,474,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,774,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issued and potentially dilutive ordinary shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,202,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,001,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarket Conditions, Rate Trends and Developments\nOverall, the rate environment has improved in both our reinsurance and insurance segments following one of the costliest years of catastrophe losses on record in 2017.\nWe achieved an overall rate increase of approximately 6% for our reinsurance business during the January 1, 2018 renewals where we renewed approximately 50% of our annual book of reinsurance business. In addition, our Aspen Capital Markets business continues to provide investors with direct access to our underwriting expertise, and to provide brokers and clients with additional capacity. It also gives us the flexibility to manage our exposures.\nWhile the January 1, 2018 renewals are less important for our insurance business, we achieved double digit percentage rate increases in marine and energy liability, marine hull, U.S. ocean marine and U.S. property and we obtained approximately 5% to 10% rate increases in U.S. energy and U.S. environmental. We achieved a rate increase of approximately 14% for our U.S. property book in conjunction with improved terms and conditions. Other insurance lines of business achieved up to 4% rate increases during the January 1, 2018 renewals.\nFollowing the large catastrophe losses in 2017, we continue to seek to balance our insurance portfolio and to target the best risk-adjusted returns. As a result, we expect to reduce our exposure to major property accounts that contain considerable catastrophe accumulations. As a result of the increased frequency of large and attritional losses in our insurance segment in 2017, we have likewise taken a more risk-averse view by retaining less risk and ceding more premiums with the aim to stabilize earnings. We have also significantly reduced our voluntary participation into our internal reinsurance vehicle. As a result of these actions, we expect our net written premium to gross written premium ratio to reduce to 60% in 2018.\nWe continue to expect that our Effectiveness and Efficiency Program will deliver savings of approximately $30 million in 2018, $55 million in 2019 and $75 million in 2020, after which run-rate savings are expected to be approximately $80 million per year. As a result of the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program, we expect our total expense ratio to continue to decline over the next three years.\nIn addition, we expect the recently enacted U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to have a modest impact on the amount of tax that we will pay. We expect that the U.S. tax bill will decrease net income by approximately $10 million or more in 2018 although the ultimate impact will depend on where our profits are generated.\nSee Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included in this report.\nRecent Developments\nOn January 5, 2018, we notified the Prudential Regulation Authority of our intention to close Aspen U.K.'s branches in Paris, France and Cologne, Germany. We expect these branches to be closed during the first quarter of 2018.\nDuring January 2018, we sold $206.9 million of equity securities from our investment portfolio and realized a net gain of $36.7 million.\nOn January 26, 2018, S&P affirmed the ratings of our Operating Subsidiaries but changed their outlook to negative from stable. On February 6, 2018, Moody's affirmed the ratings of our Operating Subsidiaries but changed their outlook to negative from stable. Both rating agencies stated certain factors which, if not achieved, could lead the relevant rating agency to downgrade the ratings of our Operating Subsidiaries. See Risk Factors - Our Operating Subsidiaries are rated and our Lloyd's business benefits from a rating by one or more of A.M. Best, S&P and Moody's and a decline in any of these ratings could adversely affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our premiums and earnings to decrease and limit our ability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares\u201d for a discussion of some potential risks relating to our ratings.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective in nature and require management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine the reported values. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. A statement of all the significant accounting policies we use to prepare our financial statements is included in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. If factors such as those described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d cause actual events to differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting policy and calculating financial results, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nWritten Premiums\nWritten premiums comprise the estimated premiums on contracts of insurance and reinsurance entered into in the reporting period, except in the case of proportional reinsurance contracts, where written premiums relate only to our estimated proportional share of premiums due on contracts entered into by the ceding company prior to the end of the reporting period.\nAll premium estimates are reviewed regularly, comparing actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums along with a review of the collectability of premiums receivable. Based on management's review, the appropriateness of the premium estimates is evaluated, and any adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the periods in which they become known. Adjustments to original premium estimates could be material and these adjustments may directly and significantly impact earnings in the period they are determined because the subject premium may be fully or substantially earned.\nWe refer to premiums receivable which are not fixed at the inception of the contract as adjustment premiums. The proportion of adjustment premiums included in the premium estimates varies between business lines with the largest adjustment premiums associated with property and casualty reinsurance business and the smallest with property and liability insurance lines.\nAdjustment premiums are most significant in relation to reinsurance contracts. Different considerations apply to non-proportional and proportional treaties as follows:\nNon-proportional treaties. A large number of the reinsurance contracts we write are written on a non-proportional or excess of loss treaty basis. As the ultimate level of business written by each cedant can only be estimated at the time the reinsurance is placed, the reinsurance contracts generally stipulate a minimum and deposit premium payable under the contract with an adjustable premium determined by variables such as the number of contracts covered by the reinsurance, the total premium received by the cedant and the nature of the exposures assumed. Minimum and deposit premiums generally cover the majority of premiums due under such treaty reinsurance contracts and the adjustable portion of the premium is usually a small portion of the total premium receivable. For excess of loss contracts, the minimum and deposit premium, as defined in the contract, is generally considered to be the best estimate of the contract's written premium at inception. Accordingly, this is the amount we generally record as written premium in the period the underlying risks incept.\nDuring the life of a contract, notifications from cedants and brokers may affect the estimate of ultimate premium and result in either increases or reductions in reported revenue. Changes in estimated adjustable premiums do not generally have a significant impact on short-term liquidity as the payment of adjustment premiums generally occurs after the expiration of a contract.\nMany non-proportional treaties also include a provision for the payment to us by the cedant of reinstatement premiums based on loss experience under such contracts. Reinstatement premiums are the premiums charged for the restoration of the reinsurance limit of an excess of loss contract to its full amount after payment by the reinsurer of losses as a result of an occurrence. These premiums relate to the future coverage obtained during the remainder of the initial policy term and are included in revenue in the same period as the corresponding losses.\nProportional treaties ( treaty pro rata\u201d). Estimates of premiums assumed under treaty pro rata reinsurance contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks are expected to incept and are based on information provided by brokers and ceding companies and estimates of the underlying economic conditions at the time the risk is underwritten. We estimate premiums\nreceivable initially and update our premium estimates regularly throughout the contract term based on treaty statements received from the ceding company.\nThe reported gross written premiums for treaty pro rata business include estimates of premiums due to us but not yet reported by the cedant because of time delays between contracts being written by our cedants and their submission of treaty statements to us. This additional premium is normally described as pipeline premium. Treaty statements disclose information on the underlying contracts of insurance written by our cedants and are generally submitted on a monthly or quarterly basis, from 30 to 90 days in arrears. In order to report all risks incepting prior to a period end, we estimate the premiums written between the last submitted treaty statement and the period end. Treaty pro rata premiums are written predominantly in our other property, specialty and casualty reinsurance line of business.\nProperty treaty pro rata made a significant contribution to our reinsurance segment where we wrote $242.5 million in gross written premium in 2017 (2016 - $226.7 million), or 15.7% of the gross written premium in our reinsurance segment, of which $76.6 million was estimated (2016 - $53.1 million) and $165.9 million was reported by the cedants (2016 - $173.6 million). Excluding the impact of fixed costs, such as reinsurance premiums and operating expenses, we estimate that the impact of a $1.0 million increase / decrease in our estimated gross written premiums in our property treaty pro rata business would increase / decrease net income before tax by approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 (2016 - $0.1 million increase /decrease).\nThe most likely drivers of change in our premium estimates in decreasing order of magnitude are:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in the renewal rate or rate of new business acceptances by the cedant insurance companies leading to lower or greater volumes of ceded premiums than our estimate, which could result from changes in the relevant primary market that could affect more than one of our cedants or could be a consequence of changes in marketing strategy or risk appetite by a particular cedant;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in the rates being charged by cedants; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>differences between the pattern of inception dates assumed in our estimate and the actual pattern of inception dates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We anticipate that ultimate premiums might reasonably be expected to vary by up to 5% as a result of variations in one or more of the assumptions described above, although larger variations are possible. Based on gross written premiums of $242.5 million (2016 - $226.7 million) in our property reinsurance treaty pro rata account as at December 31, 2017, a variation of 5% could increase or reduce net income before tax by approximately $1.2 million (2016 - $0.5 million).\nEarned premiums. Premiums are recognized as earned over the policy exposure periods. The premium related to the unexpired portion of each policy at the end of the reporting period is included in the balance sheet as unearned premiums.\nReserving Approach\nWe are required by U.S. GAAP to establish loss reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses ( ultimate losses\u201d) under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers. Our loss reserves comprise the following components:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the cost of claims reported to us but not yet paid known as case reserves ( case reserves\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>IBNR reserves to cover the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not reported. Within this, we also include the potential development of reported claims; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the expenses associated with settling claims, including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process, known as the loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d).\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Prior to the selection of the reserves to be included in our financial statements, our actuarial team employs a number of techniques to establish a range of estimates from which they consider it reasonable for management to select a \u2018best estimate' (the actuarial range\u201d).\nCase Reserves. For reported claims, reserves are established on a case-by-case basis within the parameters of coverage provided in the insurance policy or reinsurance agreement. The method of establishing case reserves for reported claims differs among our operations. With respect to our insurance operations, we are advised of potential insured losses and our claims handlers record reserves for the estimated amount of the expected indemnity settlement, loss adjustment expenses and cost of defense where appropriate. The reserve estimate reflects the judgment of the claims personnel and is based on claim information obtained to date, general reserving practices, the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature of the specific claim and where appropriate and available, advice from legal counsel, loss adjusters and other claims experts.\nWith respect to our reinsurance claims operations, claims handlers set case reserves for reported claims generally based on the claims reports received from our ceding companies and take into consideration our cedants' own reserve recommendations and our prior loss experience with the cedant. Additional case reserves ( ACR\u201d), in addition to the cedants' own recommended reserves, may be established by us to reflect our estimated ultimate cost of a loss. ACRs are generally the result of either a claims handler's own experience and knowledge of handling similar claims, general reserving practices or the result of reserve recommendations following an audit of cedants' reserves.\nCase reserves are based on a subjective judgment of facts and circumstances and are established for the purposes of internal reserving only. Accordingly, they do not represent a commitment to any course of conduct or admission of liability on our behalf in relation to any specific claim.\nIBNR Reserves. The need for IBNR reserves arises from time lags between when a loss occurs and when it is actually reported and settled. By definition, we do not have specific information on IBNR claims so they need to be estimated by actuarial methodologies. IBNR reserves are therefore generally calculated at an aggregate level and cannot generally be identified as reserves for a particular loss or contract. We calculate IBNR reserves by class of business within each line of business. Where appropriate, analyses may be conducted on sub-sets of a class of business. IBNR reserves are calculated by projecting our ultimate losses on each class of business and subtracting paid losses and case reserves. IBNR reserves also cover the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not reported, within this we also include any potential development of reported claims. Over recent years, we have begun to place greater reliance on our actual actuarial experience for our long-tail lines of business that we have written since our inception in 2002. We believe that our earliest accident years are now capable of providing us with meaningful actuarial indications. Estimates and judgments for new insurance and reinsurance lines of business are more difficult to make than those made for more mature lines of business because we have more limited historical information through December 31, 2017.\nSources of Information. Claims information received typically includes the loss date, details of the claim, the recommended reserve and reports from the loss adjusters dealing with the claim. In respect of pro rata treaties and any business written through managing general agents, we receive regular statements (bordereaux) which provide paid and outstanding claims information, often with large losses separately identified. Following widely reported loss events, such as catastrophes and airplane crashes, we adopt a proactive approach to establish our likely exposure to claims by reviewing policy listings and contacting brokers and policyholders as appropriate.\nActuarial Methodologies. The main projection methodologies that are used by our actuaries are as follows:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Initial expected loss ratio ( IELR\u201d) method: This method calculates an estimate of ultimate losses by applying an estimated loss ratio to an estimate of ultimate earned premium for each accident year. The estimated loss ratio may be based on pricing information and/or industry data and/or historical claims experience revalued to the year under review.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Bornhuetter-Ferguson ( BF\u201d) method: The BF method uses as a starting point an assumed IELR and blends in the loss ratio, which is implied by the claims experience to date using benchmark loss development patterns on paid claims data ( Paid BF\u201d) or reported claims data ( Reported BF\u201d). Although the method tends to provide less volatile indications at early stages of development and reflects changes in the external environment, it can be slow to react to emerging loss development and can, if the IELR proves to be inaccurate, produce loss estimates which take longer to converge with the final settlement value of loss.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Loss development ( Chain Ladder\u201d) method: This method uses actual loss data and the historical development profiles on older accident years to project more recent, less developed years to their ultimate position.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Exposure-based method: This method is typically used for specific large catastrophic events such as a major hurricane. All exposure is identified and we work with known market information and information from our cedants to determine a percentage of the exposure to be taken as the ultimate loss.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to these methodologies, our actuaries may use other approaches depending upon the characteristics of the class of business and available data.\nIn general terms, the IELR method is most appropriate for classes of business and/or accident years where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet mature enough to modify our initial expectations of the ultimate loss ratios. Typical examples would be recent accident years for classes of business in casualty reinsurance. The BF method is generally appropriate where there are few reported claims and a relatively less stable pattern of reported losses. Typical examples would be our treaty risk excess class of business in our reinsurance segment and marine hull class of business in our insurance segment. The Chain Ladder method is appropriate when there are relatively stable patterns of loss emergence and a relatively large number of reported claims. Typical examples are the U.K. commercial property and U.K. commercial liability classes of business in our international insurance business.\nReserving Procedures and Process. Our actuaries calculate the IELR, BF and Chain Ladder and, if appropriate, other methods for each class of business and each accident year. They then calculate a single point actuarial mean best estimate ( ultimate\u201d) for each class of business and provide a stochastic distribution around the mean for each line of business. The actuarial methodologies involve significant subjective judgments reflecting many factors, including but not limited to, changes in legislative conditions, changes in judicial interpretation of legal liability policy coverages and inflation. Our actuaries collaborate with our underwriting, claims, legal and finance teams in identifying factors which are incorporated in their range of ultimates in which management's best estimate is most likely to fall. The actuarial stochastic distribution is designed to provide management with a range from which it is reasonable to select a single management best estimate for inclusion in our financial statements.\nThere are no differences between our year-end and our quarterly internal reserving procedures and processes because our actuaries perform the basic projections and analyses described above for each class of business quarterly.\nSelection of Reported Gross Reserves. Management, through its Reserve Committees, reviews the actuarial stochastic distribution and any other evidence before selecting its management best estimate of reserves for each line of business. Management selects the management best estimate\u201d by considering all the information provided to them and by considering the risks and uncertainties within the actuarial mean best estimate. Management has to date selected its best estimate above that of the actuarial mean best estimate and within the range of the actuarial stochastic distribution. This provides the basis for the recommendation to the Audit Committee and the Board made by management regarding the reserve amounts and related disclosures to be recorded in our financial statements.\nThere are three Reserve Committees, one for each of the insurance and reinsurance segments and a core\u201d committee that makes final reserving recommendations. The core\u201d Reserve Committee currently consists of the Group Chief Risk Officer (the chair), the Group Head of Capital Management, the Group Head of Risk, the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Insurance Chief Financial Officer and the President and Chief Underwriting Officer of Aspen Re. Senior members of the insurance and reinsurance segment underwriting and claims staff comprise the remaining members of each of the insurance and reinsurance reserve committees, respectively.\nEach class of business within each line of business is reviewed in detail by management through its Reserve Committee at least once a year. The timing of such reviews varies throughout the year. Additionally, we review the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations every fiscal quarter for all classes of business. If warranted from this analysis, we may accelerate the timing of our detailed actuarial reviews.\nUncertainties. While the management selected reserves make a reasonable provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense obligations, we note that the process of estimating required reserves, by its very nature, involves uncertainty and therefore the ultimate claims may fall outside the actuarial range. The level of uncertainty can be influenced by such factors as the existence of coverage with long duration reporting patterns and changes in claims handling practices, as well as the other factors described above.\nBecause many of the coverages underwritten involve claims that may not be ultimately settled for many years after they are incurred, subjective judgments as to the ultimate exposure to losses are an integral and necessary component of the loss reserving process. We review our reserves regularly, using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claims costs, frequency and severity data, and prevailing economic, social and legal factors. Reserves established in prior periods are adjusted as claims experience develops and new information becomes available.\nEstimates of IBNR are generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than estimates of the cost of settling claims already notified to us, where more information about the claim event is generally available. IBNR claims often may not be apparent to the insured until many years after the event giving rise to the claims has happened. Classes of business where the IBNR proportion of the total reserve is high, such as casualty insurance, will typically display greater variations between initial estimates and final outcomes because of the greater degree of difficulty of estimating these reserves.\nClasses of business where claims are typically reported relatively quickly after the claim event tend to display lower levels of volatility between initial estimates and final outcomes. Reinsurance claims are subject to a longer time lag both in their reporting and in their time to final settlement. The time lag is a factor which is included in the projections to ultimate claims within the actuarial analyses and helps to explain why in general a higher proportion of the initial reinsurance reserves are represented by IBNR than for insurance reserves for business in the same class. Delays in receiving information from cedants are an expected part of normal business operations and are included within the statistical estimate of IBNR to the extent that current levels of backlog are consistent with historical data. Currently, there are no processing backlogs which would materially affect our financial statements.\nAllowance is made, however, for changes or uncertainties which may create distortions in the underlying statistics or which might cause the cost of unsettled claims to increase or reduce when compared with the cost of previously settled claims, including:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in our processes which might accelerate or slow down the development and/or recording of paid or incurred claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in the legal environment (including challenges to tort reform);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the effects of inflation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in the mix of business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the impact of large losses; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in our cedants' reserving methodologies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> These factors are incorporated in the recommended reserve range from which management selects its best point estimate. We take all reasonable steps to ensure that we utilize all appropriate information and actuarial techniques in establishing our IBNR reserves. However, given the uncertainty in establishing claims liabilities, it is likely that the final outcome will prove to be different from the original provision established at the balance sheet date. Changes to our previous estimates of prior period loss reserves impact the reported calendar year underwriting results by worsening our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be deficient or improving our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant. As at December 31, 2017, a 5% change in the gross reserve for IBNR losses would have equated to a change of approximately $186.0 million in loss reserves which would represent 66.0% of loss before income tax for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. As at December 31, 2016, a 5% change in the gross reserve for IBNR losses would have equated to a change of approximately $152.2 million in loss reserves which would represent 72.6% of income before income tax for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. A 5% change in our net loss reserves equates to $261.7 million and represents 5.0% of shareholders' equity as at December 31, 2017.\nThere are specific areas of our selected reserves which have additional uncertainty associated with them. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors -Insurance Risks - Our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected if actual claims exceed our loss reserves\u201d for a discussion of the specific areas of our selected reserves which have additional uncertainty. In each case, management believes they have selected an appropriate best estimate based on current information and current analyses.\nLoss Reserving Sensitivity Analysis. The most significant key assumptions identified in the reserving process are that (i) the historic loss development and trend experience is assumed to be indicative of future loss development and trends, (ii) the information developed from internal and independent external sources can be used to develop meaningful estimates of the initial expected ultimate loss ratios, and (iii) no significant losses or types of losses will emerge that are not represented in either the initial expected loss ratios or the historical development patterns.\nWe believe that there is potentially significant risk in estimating loss reserves for long-tail lines of business and for immature accident years that may not be adequately captured through traditional actuarial projection methodologies. As discussed above, these methodologies usually rely heavily on projections of prior year trends into the future. In selecting our best estimate of future liabilities, we consider both the results of actuarial point estimates of loss reserves in addition to the stochastic distribution of reserves. In determining the appropriate best estimate, we review (i) the position of overall reserves within the actuarial distribution, (ii) the result of bottom up analysis by accident year reflecting the impact of parameter uncertainty in actuarial calculations, and (iii) specific qualitative information on events that may have an effect on future claims but which may not have been adequately reflected in actuarial best estimates, such as the potential for outstanding litigation or claims practices of cedants to have an adverse impact.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. Given the risks and uncertainties associated with the process for estimating reserves for losses and loss expenses, management has performed an evaluation of the potential variability in loss reserves and the impact this variability may have on reported results, financial condition and liquidity. Because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above, we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates, and we have generally experienced favorable net development on prior year reserves in the last several years. However, there is no assurance that this will occur in future periods.\nManagement's best estimate of the net reserve for losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2017 was $5,234.3 million. The following tables show the effect on estimated net reserves for losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2017 of a change in two of the most critical assumptions in establishing reserves: (i) loss emergence patterns, accelerated or decelerated by three and six months; and (ii) expected loss ratios varied by plus or minus five and ten percent. Management believes that these scenarios present a reasonable range of variability around the booked reserves using standard actuarial techniques. Loss reserves may vary beyond these scenarios in periods of heightened or reduced claim activity.

However, there can be no assurance that actual payments will not vary significantly from total reserves. The reserve for losses and loss expenses and the methodology of estimating such reserve are regularly reviewed and updated as new information becomes known. Any resulting adjustments are reflected in income in the period in which they become known.\nResults of Operations\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Gross written premiums in our reinsurance segment increased by 9.6% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to growth in agriculture insurance business written within specialty reinsurance and due to $32.3 million of reinstatement premiums associated with catastrophe losses. Gross written premiums from our insurance segment increased by 4.5% due to growth in financial and professional lines insurance partially offset by reductions in marine, aviation and energy insurance where we continue to experience challenging market conditions and in property and casualty insurance as a result of a change in our appetite for this type of business.\nOverall gross written premiums in 2016 increased by 5.0% compared to 2015 due primarily to our specialty reinsurance and casualty reinsurance business lines. The increase in our specialty reinsurance business was largely due to growth in agriculture business written following our acquisition of AgriLogic in January 2016 (which was subsequently sold in December 2017) and growth in specialty marine business. The increase in casualty reinsurance lines of business was largely due to growth in our U.S. casualty treaty and international casualty business lines. Premiums from our insurance segments reduced slightly due to reductions in our property and casualty and marine, aviation and energy business lines offset by growth in financial and professional lines insurance.\nCeded written premiums.

Ceded written premiums increased in both segments in part due to the purchase of a whole account quota share contract. Ceded reinsurance premiums increased for our insurance segment due to the restructure of our ceded reinsurance arrangements though the use of significant quota share reinsurance arrangements and the recognition of ceded premiums to reinstate cover following catastrophe and other large losses. Ceded reinsurance premiums also increased for our reinsurance segment due to increased reinsurance for our property catastrophe and other property business lines due to new business opportunities which were written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession, an increase in ceded reinsurance premiums following the sale of AgriLogic in December 2017 and due to the recognition of additional ceded premiums as a result of reinstating cover following catastrophe losses. Due to these changes, the retention ratio, which is defined as net written premium as a percentage of gross written premium, decreased from 82.4% in 2016 to 65.8% in 2017.\nIn 2016, total ceded written premiums increased by $202.2 million compared to 2015. Ceded reinsurance costs increased for our reinsurance segment due to increased ceded reinsurance for our property catastrophe business line for new business opportunities written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession costs and due to our agriculture business reported in our specialty reinsurance business line. Ceded reinsurance costs increased for our insurance segment because we restructured our ceded reinsurance arrangements to reduce earnings volatility and benefit the expense ratio. In addition, we purchased an adverse development cover in the fourth quarter of 2016 for certain casualty business which we have ceased to underwrite. These changes led the retention ratio to decrease from 88.3% in 2015 to 82.4% in 2016.\nNet premiums earned.

Net premiums earned increased by $164.0 million, or 6.6%, in 2016 compared to 2015 due to growth in gross earned premium and the impact from and the increases in ceded written premiums in 2016 not substantially flowing into earnings until 2017.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses. The loss ratio for 2017 of 86.5% increased by 26.7 percentage points compared to 2016. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased from $1,576.1 million in 2016 to $1,994.7 million in 2017. The increase in the loss ratio was largely due to a $409.6 million increase in catastrophe losses, a $59.7 million increase in large losses, a $23.9 million decrease in prior year reserve releases and a decrease in net earned premiums, as above. In 2017, net losses from major catastrophes increased by $409.6 million to $576.0 million compared with $166.4 million in 2016. Large losses in 2017 included $64.0 million of fire-related losses, a $12.6 million surety loss, an $11.1 million loss related to cyber and terrorism and a $4.8 million loss from a refinery explosion.\nThe loss ratio for 2016 of 59.8% increased by 4.6 percentage points compared to 2015. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased from $1,366.2 million in 2015 to $1,576.1 million in 2016 due to an increase in large and catastrophe losses, changes in business mix towards lines which have higher non-catastrophe loss ratios and a reduction in reserve releases. In 2016, net losses from major catastrophes increased by $75.9 million to $166.4 million compared with $90.5 million in 2015. Large losses in 2016 included $32.7 million of energy-related losses, $11.8 million of fire-related losses and a $4.2 million aviation loss.\nIn the reinsurance segment, the loss ratio for 2017 was 92.6% compared to 55.7% in 2016 largely due to a $352.5 million increase in catastrophe losses, a $25.3 million increase in large losses and a $5.2 million decrease in reserve releases. In 2017, we experienced $467.3 million of catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, associated with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, wildfires in California, earthquakes in Mexico and other weather-related events in the U.S. and Australia. In the comparable period in 2016, we experienced $114.8 million of natural catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, associated with wildfires in Canada, earthquakes in Japan and Taiwan, Hurricane Matthew and other weather-related events in the U.S. and Europe.\nIn the insurance segment, the loss ratio for 2017 was 79.8% compared to 63.1% in 2016. The increase in the loss ratio was largely due to a $57.1 million increase in catastrophe losses, a $34.4 million increase in large losses, an increase in attritional losses, an $18.7 million decrease in reserve releases and a decrease in net earned premiums. In 2017, there were $108.7 million of catastrophe losses associated with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, wildfires in California and U.S. weather-related events. The loss ratio for 2016 was 63.1% compared to 62.4% for 2015. The increase in the loss ratio in 2016 was mainly due to a decrease of $23.4 million in prior year reserve releases and a $10.7 million increase in catastrophe losses. In 2016, our insurance segment experienced $51.6 million of catastrophe losses associated with U.S. weather-related events and Hurricane Matthew.\nOverall, prior year reserve releases decreased by $23.9 million from $129.3 million in 2016 to $105.4 million in 2017. The reinsurance segment had reserve releases of $81.8 million compared to $87.0 million in 2016. The reserve releases from the reinsurance segment were across all reinsurance business lines. The insurance segment had reserve releases of $23.6 million compared to $42.3 million in 2016. The reserve releases from the insurance segment were principally from marine, energy and aviation insurance.\nOverall, prior year reserve releases reduced by $27.2 million from $156.5 million in 2015 to $129.3 million in 2016. The reserve releases from reinsurance were across all business lines, totaling $87.0 million. The insurance segment had reserve releases of $42.3 million compared to $65.7 million in 2015. The reserve releases from insurance were from marine, energy and aviation insurance and financial and professional lines insurance.\nWe have presented loss ratios both including and excluding the impact from catastrophe losses to aid in the analysis of the underlying performance of our segments. We have defined major 2017 catastrophe losses as losses associated with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the earthquakes in Mexico, a tornado in Mississippi, Cyclone Debbie in Australia, wildfires in California and other U.S. weather-related events. We have defined major 2016 catastrophe losses as losses associated with wildfires in North America, Hurricane Matthew and other weather-related events in the U.S., several earthquakes and a hailstorm in the Netherlands. We have defined major 2015 catastrophe losses as losses associated with winter storms in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, storms in the U.S., U.S. wildfires, the Chilean earthquake, U.K. floods and weather-related events in the Philippines.\nThe underlying changes in loss ratios by segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are shown in the tables below. The total loss ratio represents the calendar year U.S. GAAP loss ratio. The current year adjustments represent catastrophe loss events incurred in those years which reflect net claims and reinstatement premium adjustments.\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Loss\nRatio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current Year\nAdjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loss\nRatio Excluding\nCurrent Year\nAdjustments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Loss\nRatio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current Year\nAdjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loss\nRatio Excluding\nCurrent Year\nAdjustments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Loss\nRatio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current Year\nAdjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loss\nRatio Excluding\nCurrent Year\nAdjustments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExpenses.

</tr>\n</table>\n____________________\n(1) The total group general and administrative expense ratio includes corporate and non-operating expenses. Comparative ratios have been re-presented to include corporate and non-operating expenses.\nPolicy acquisition expenses decreased by $128.4 million in 2017 compared to 2016 as although gross policy acquisition expenses increased this was more than offset by an increase in over-rider commissions associated with the increase in ceded reinsurance. Policy acquisition expenses increased by $45.3 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to growth in written premiums and higher profit commission accruals.\nThe decrease in the policy acquisition expense ratio, gross of the effect of reinsurance, to 18.6% in 2017 from 18.9% in 2016 is due to a reduction in profit commission accruals in the insurance segment partially offset by an increase in the acquisition ratio in the reinsurance segment due to an increase in profit commission accruals and the prior year benefiting from FET refunds.\nThe reduction in the policy acquisition expense ratio, gross of the effect of reinsurance, to 18.9% in 2016 from 19.0% in 2015 was due to FET refunds and changes in business mix toward agriculture and specialty marine business lines which have lower average commission rates.\nGeneral, administrative and corporate expenses increased by $12.1 million from $490.1 million in 2016 to $502.2 million in 2017 due to $15.2 million of costs associated with the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program, and increased costs associated with growth in our insurance business, partially offset by lower provisions for performance-related remuneration. General, administrative and corporate expenses increased by $66.1 million from $424.0 million in 2015 to $490.1 million in 2016 due to costs associated with AgriLogic which we acquired in January 2016 and subsequently sold in December 2017, costs associated with growth in our insurance and reinsurance business and reorganization costs.\nInvestment gains. Total net realized and unrealized investment gains for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $120.5 million (2016 - losses of $45.2 million; 2015 - losses of $17.0 million).\nNet investment income. In 2017, we generated net investment income of $189.0 million, an increase of 1.0% on the prior year (2016 - $187.1 million, 2015 - $185.5 million). The increase was primarily due to the increase in the book yield of the fixed income portfolio despite a reduction in dividend income following the sale of a portion of our equity portfolio in the third quarter of 2017. The increase in investment income in 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to an increase in invested assets.\nForeign exchange contracts. We use foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risk. A foreign exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract. Foreign exchange contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time.\nAs at December 31, 2017, we held foreign exchange contracts that were not designated as hedging under ASC 815 - \"Derivatives and Hedging\" with a notional amount of $751.6 million (2016 - $665.6 million). The foreign exchange contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value in the balance sheet with changes recorded as a change in fair value of derivatives in the statement of operations. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign exchange contracts on net income was a gain of $27.7 million (December 31, 2016 - loss of $21.5 million).\nAs at December 31, 2017, we held foreign exchange contracts that were designated as hedging under ASC 815 with a notional amount of $60.6 million (2016 - $108.6 million). The foreign exchange contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value in the balance sheet with the effective portion recorded in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion recorded as a change in fair value of derivatives in the statement of operations. The contracts are considered to be effective and therefore the movement in other comprehensive income representing the effective portion was a gain of $3.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 - gain of $0.7 million).\nAs the foreign exchange contracts settle, the realized gain or loss is reclassified from other comprehensive income into general, administration and corporate expenses of the statement of operations and other comprehensive income. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the amount recognized within general, administration and corporate expenses for settled foreign exchange contracts was a realized gain of $4.4 million (December 31, 2016 - loss of $8.7 million recognized within general, administration and corporate expenses).\nInterest on long-term debt. Interest on long-term debt is the interest due on our senior notes.\nIncome before tax. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, loss before tax was $281.8 million (2016 - income of$209.5 million; 2015 - income of $337.5 million), consisting of the amounts set out in the table below:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(499.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of loan notes issued by variable interest entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized investment gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized investment (losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized and unrealized foreign exchange (losses) gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income before tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(281.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in underwriting income in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to higher catastrophe losses, lower reserve releases, an increase in large losses, an increase in attritional losses in the insurance segment and a reduction in premiums earned offset by a reduction in expenses. The decrease in underwriting income in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to higher catastrophe losses, lower reserve releases and an increase in expenses, partially offset by growth in premiums earned.\nThe increase in corporate and non-operating expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to $15.2 million of costs associated with implementing the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program and higher salary costs due to increased headcount as a result of growth in our insurance and reinsurance business, partially offset by reductions in performance-related remuneration provisions. The increase in corporate and non-operating expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to higher salary costs due to increased headcount as result of growth in our insurance and reinsurance business and reorganization costs.\nChange in fair value of derivatives. The change in fair value of derivatives in 2017 was attributable to foreign exchange contracts that had a gain of $27.7 million compared to a loss of $21.5 million in 2016 and a gain of $11.6 million in 2015. Interest rate swaps\nhad a realized loss of $3.1 million and $4.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. There was no gain or loss in 2017 because we terminated our interest rate swaps on May 6, 2016.\nThe $21.2 million change in fair value of loan notes issued by variable interest entities represents the proportion of profit or loss generated by Silverton attributable to third-party investors. The reduction in the value of the loan notes in 2017 is due to catastrophe losses assumed by Silverton. The increase in the value in 2016 and 2015 is due to premiums received by Silverton being greater than the losses assumed.\nIncome tax expense. There was an income tax credit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 of $15.4 million compared to an expense of $6.1 million and $14.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 on our loss before tax was 5.5% (2016 - 2.9%; 2015 - 4.3%) and is representative of the geographic spread of our business between taxable and non-taxable jurisdictions.\nNet income after tax. In 2017, we had net loss after tax of $266.4 million, equivalent to $5.22 basic loss per ordinary share adjusted for the $36.2 million preference share dividends, $8.0 million of preference share redemption costs and $1.3 million non-controlling interest. Fully diluted loss per ordinary share was $5.22 for 2017. In 2016, we had net income after tax of $203.4 million, equivalent to $2.67 basic earnings per ordinary share adjusted for the $41.8 million preference share dividends and $0.1 million non-controlling interest. Fully diluted earnings per ordinary share were $2.61 in 2016. In 2015, we had net income after tax of $323.1 million, equivalent to fully diluted earnings per ordinary share of $4.54. For a more detailed description of basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share, see Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements, Earnings per Ordinary Share.\u201d\nUnderwriting Results by Business Segment\nWe are organized into two business segments: reinsurance and insurance. The Company has determined its reportable segments, Aspen Insurance and Aspen Re, by taking into account the manner in which management makes operating decisions and assesses\noperating performance.\nManagement measures segment results on the basis of the combined ratio, which is obtained by dividing the sum of the losses and loss expenses, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and operating and administrative expenses by net premiums earned. Other than corporate expenses, indirect operating and administrative expenses are allocated to segments predominantly based on each segment's proportional share of gross earned premiums.\nNon-underwriting disclosures. We provide additional disclosures for corporate and other (non-underwriting) income and expenses. Corporate and other income and expenses include net investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains or losses, expenses associated with managing the Group, certain strategic and non-recurring costs, changes in fair value of derivatives and changes in fair value of loan notes issued by variable interest entities, interest expense, net realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses and income taxes, which are not allocated to the business segments. Corporate expenses are not allocated to our business segments as they typically do not fluctuate with the levels of premiums written and are not directly related to our segment operations.\nWe do not allocate our assets by segment as we evaluate underwriting results of each segment separately from the results of our investment portfolio. Segment profit or loss for each of our operating segments is measured by underwriting profit or loss. See Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements, Segment Reporting\u201d for information on gross and net premiums written and earned, underwriting results, and combined ratios and reserves for each of our business segments.\nReinsurance\nOur reinsurance segment consists of property catastrophe, other property reinsurance, casualty and specialty reinsurance. For a more detailed description of this segment, see Part I, Item 1, Business - Business Segments - Reinsurance\u201d and Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements, Segment Reporting.\u201d\nGross written premiums. The table below shows our gross written premiums for each line of business for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and the percentage change in gross written premiums for each line of business:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lines of Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property catastrophe reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>273.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other property reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>360.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Casualty reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>319.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>320.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>287.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>599.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>491.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>326.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,548.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,413.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,248.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in property catastrophe reinsurance gross written premiums was primarily due to $22.2 million of reinstatement premiums associated with catastrophe losses recognized in 2017 partially offset by premium reductions due to challenging market conditions and downward revisions on premium estimates. The increase in other property reinsurance gross written premiums was largely due to reductions in premium estimates for proportional contracts in the comparative period. Gross written premiums in casualty reinsurance decreased slightly due to reductions in U.S. casualty treaty business lines. The increase in gross written premiums in specialty reinsurance was predominantly due to growth in agriculture insurance business, as well as growth in engineering and cyber business lines.\nThe 13.2% increase in gross written premiums for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the equivalent period in 2015 was attributable to increased business written in our specialty reinsurance and casualty reinsurance business lines. The increase in our specialty reinsurance gross written premiums was mainly due to growth in agriculture business written following our acquisition of AgriLogic in January 2016. The increase in our casualty reinsurance gross written premiums was largely due to growth in our U.S. casualty treaty and international casualty business lines. The slight decrease in property catastrophe reinsurance gross written premiums was largely due to reductions in business written due to challenging market conditions, partially offset by new business opportunities which were written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession costs. The decrease in other property reinsurance gross written premiums was largely due to challenging market conditions and adjustments in prior year premium estimates on proportional contracts.\nCeded written premiums. Total ceded written premiums in 2017 was $298.5 million, an increase of $154.5 million compared to 2016. Ceded written premiums increased across all lines of business due to the purchase of a whole account quota share contract in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in ceded written premiums in property catastrophe and other property reinsurance was due to new business opportunities which were written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession. Ceded written premiums also increased in property catastrophe and other property reinsurance due to the recognition of ceded costs to reinstate cover following catastrophe losses. The increase in ceded written premiums in specialty reinsurance was due to an increase in retrocession costs following the sale of our agriculture business in December 2017. Total ceded written premiums in 2016 was $144.0 million, an increase of $48.6 million compared to $95.4 million in 2015. The largest increase in ceded written premiums in 2016 was in specialty reinsurance as a result of increased retrocession costs following the acquisition of AgriLogic in January 2016 and in property catastrophe reinsurance due to new business opportunities which were written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession costs.\nNet premiums earned. Net premiums earned increased by $24.2 million, or 2.0%, in 2017 compared to 2016 largely due to increased business written in specialty reinsurance and inwards reinstatement premiums associated with catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased ceded costs. Net premiums earned increased by $109.3 million, or 10.2%, in 2016 compared to 2015 largely due to increased business written in specialty reinsurance and casualty reinsurance, partially offset by increased ceded costs in specialty reinsurance and property catastrophe reinsurance lines.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses. The loss ratio in 2017 of 92.6% increased by 36.9 percentage points compared to 55.7% in 2016. The increase in the loss ratio was mainly due to a $352.5 million increase in catastrophe losses. The increase in the loss ratio was compounded by a $5.2 million decrease in prior year reserve releases compared to 2016 and $25.3 million of large fire related losses, the largest of which was a fire in a chemical plant, compared with no large losses in 2016. In 2017, our reinsurance segment experienced $467.3 million of catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, including $72.1 million from Hurricane Harvey, $119.6 million from Hurricane Irma, $57.1 million from Hurricane Maria, $16.6 million from the earthquakes in Mexico, $7.2 million from a tornado in Mississippi, $5.7 million from Cyclone Debbie in Australia, $125.8 million from the wildfires in California and $32.9 million from U.S. weather-related events.\nThe loss ratio in 2016 of 55.7% increased compared to 45.8% in 2015 mainly due to an increase in catastrophe losses of $65.2 million, changes in business mix towards lines which have higher non-catastrophe ratios and a $3.8 million decrease in prior year reserve releases. In 2016, our reinsurance segment experienced $114.8 million of catastrophe losses, including $35.4 million from the wildfires in Canada, $10.5 million from an earthquake in New Zealand, $9.3 million from Hurricane Matthew, $8.5 million from an earthquake in Japan, $9.2 million from U.S wildfires, $5.0 million from a hailstorm in the Netherlands, $2.3 million from an earthquake in Taiwan and $31.2 million from U.S. weather-related events.\nThe $5.2 million reduction in prior year reserve releases from $87.0 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 to $81.8 million in the current period included a $13.1 million reinsurance recovery in respect of an offshore energy-related loss that occurred in Africa and adverse development of $12.8 million in casualty reinsurance due to the U.K. Ministry of Justice decision to increase the discount rate used to calculate lump sum awards in U.K. bodily injury cases, known as the Ogden rate. The $3.8 million decrease in prior year reserve releases from $90.8 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to $87.0 million in 2016 was due predominantly to a decrease in reserve releases from casualty lines. Prior year reserve releases are further discussed below under Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.\u201d\nPolicy acquisition, general and administrative expenses. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs were $235.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, equivalent to 19.5% of net premiums earned (2016 - $226.4 million or 19.2% of net premiums earned; 2015 - $224.7 million or 20.9% of net premiums earned). The increase in the acquisition ratio is due to an increase in profit commission accruals and the prior period benefiting from FET refunds. The decrease in policy acquisition expense ratio in 2016 compared with 2015 was due to FET refunds and changes in business mix towards agriculture and specialty marine business lines, which have lower average commission rates, and away from other property, casualty and specialty business written on a pro rata basis which have higher average commission rates.\nOur general and administrative expenses decreased by $20.9 million from $178.2 million in 2016 to $157.3 million in 2017. Our general and administrative expense ratio was 13.0% in 2017 compared to 15.1% in 2016 due to a lower provision for performance-related remuneration. Our general and administrative expense ratio of 15.1% in 2016 increased from 13.7% in 2015 due predominantly to costs associated with AgriLogic.\nInsurance\nOur insurance segment consists of property and casualty insurance, marine, aviation and energy insurance, and financial and professional lines insurance.

The decrease in gross written premiums in marine, aviation and energy insurance was largely attributable to continued challenging market conditions in marine and energy liability and aviation business lines. The increase in gross written premiums in financial and professional lines insurance was largely attributable to growth in our management liability, surety, cyber and accident and health business lines.\nThe decrease in gross written premiums in 2016 compared to 2015 in property and casualty insurance was largely attributable to reductions in our global casualty, U.S. casualty and U.S. environmental business lines, partially offset by growth in our U.S. excess casualty and railroad insurance business lines. The decrease in gross written premiums in marine, aviation and energy insurance was largely due to challenging market conditions in our marine and energy liability, U.S. inland marine, offshore energy, and energy and construction insurance business lines, partially offset by growth in our ocean cargo and aviation insurance business lines. The increase in gross written premiums in financial and professional lines insurance was largely attributable to growth in our accident and health, credit and political risks, management liability and financial institutions business lines.\nCeded written premiums. Total ceded written premiums for 2017 was $849.9 million, an increase of $440.6 million from 2016. Ceded written premiums increased as a result of the impact from restructuring our ceded reinsurance arrangements in the second half of 2016 and in particular through the use of significant quota share reinsurance arrangement which aim to reduce earnings volatility and benefit the expense ratio through an increase in over-rider commissions. Ceded written premiums also increased across all lines of business due to the purchase of a whole account quota share contract and due to the recognition of ceded costs to reinstate cover following catastrophe losses.\nCeded reinsurance for 2016 was $409.3 million, an increase of $153.6 million from 2015. Ceded reinsurance increased across all our business lines because we restructured our ceded reinsurance arrangements to seek to reduce volatility and benefit the expense ratio. In addition, we purchased an adverse development cover in the fourth quarter of 2016 for certain casualty business which we ceased to underwrite.\nNet premiums earned. Net premiums earned decreased by $354.9 million, or 24.4%, in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the impact from the increase in ceded written premiums. Net premiums earned increased by $54.7 million, or 3.9%, in 2016 compared to 2015 due to written premium growth in 2016 and the impact from the increases in ceded written premiums in 2016 not flowing into earnings until 2017.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses. The loss ratio in 2017 was 79.8% compared to 63.1% in 2016. The increase in the loss ratio in 2017 was primarily due a $57.1 million increase in catastrophe losses, an $18.7 million decrease in prior year reserve releases, a $34.4 million increase in large losses, an increase in attritional losses in U.S. property, primary casualty and management liability classes and a decrease in net earned premiums. The loss ratio in 2016 increased from 62.4% in 2015 due primarily to a $23.4 million reduction in prior year reserve releases and a $10.7 million increase in catastrophe losses.\nIn 2017, the insurance segment experienced $108.7 million of catastrophe losses, consisting of $22.4 million from Hurricane Harvey, $20.6 million from Hurricane Irma, $13.2 million from Hurricane Maria, $10.2 million from wildfires in California, and $42.3 million from U.S. weather-related events. Large losses experienced during 2017 included $38.7 million of fire-related losses, a $12.6 million surety loss, an $11.1 million loss related to cyber and terrorism and a $4.8 million refinery explosion.\nIn 2016, the insurance segment experienced $51.6 million of catastrophe losses, consisting of $39.9 million associated with U.S. weather-related events and $11.7 million from Hurricane Matthew. Large losses experienced during 2016 included $32.7 million of energy-related losses, $11.8 million of fire-related losses and a $4.2 million aviation loss.\nIn 2015, the insurance segment experienced $40.9 million of catastrophe losses, consisting of $25.7 million associated with U.K. floods and $15.2 million associated with U.S. storms. Large losses included $37.6 million of energy losses, $10.0 million associated with a dam collapse in Brazil and $3.0 million associated with the port explosion in Tianjin, China.\nIn 2017, there were reserve releases of $23.6 million compared to $42.3 million of reserve releases in 2016. The reserve releases were principally from our marine, aviation and energy business lines which included an additional $15.4 million reinsurance recovery in respect of an offshore energy-related loss that occurred in Africa which offset adverse development in property and casualty insurance and financial and professional lines insurance. The reserve releases in 2016 were predominantly from marine, energy and aviation insurance and financial and professional lines insurance offsetting adverse development in our property and casualty insurance. Prior year reserve releases are further discussed under Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.\u201d\nPolicy acquisition, general and administrative expenses. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs were $165.0 million in 2017, equivalent to 15.0% of net premiums earned (2016 - $302.5 million or 20.8% of net premiums earned; 2015 - $258.9 million or 18.5% of net earned premium). The decrease in the acquisition expense ratio in 2017 compared with 2016 was due to lower profit commission accruals and an increase in over-rider commissions. The increase in the acquisition expense ratio in 2016 compared with 2015 was due to higher profit commission accruals and lower ceding commissions.\nOur general and administrative expenses increased by $25.5 million to $253.9 million in 2017 from $228.4 million in 2016. Our general and administrative expense ratio was 23.1% in 2017 compared to 15.7% in 2016 due predominantly to costs associated with growth in the business. General and administrative expenses of $228.4 million in 2016 increased from $213.6 million in 2015 largely due to costs associated with growth in the business.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal cash and investments\nAs at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, total cash and investments, including accrued interest receivable, were $8.7 billion and $9.2 billion, respectively. Total cash and investments decreased mainly as a result of increased payments associated with the increase in ceded written premiums and due to increased claims payments during 2017. Our investment strategy is focused on delivering stable investment income and total return through all market cycles while maintaining appropriate portfolio liquidity and credit quality to meet the requirements of our customers, rating agencies and regulators.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our investments consisted of a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities including U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt, global equities and money market funds. Our overall portfolio strategy remains focused on high quality fixed income investments. In the third quarter of 2017, we took advantage of rising equity markets and sold $208.1 million of our equity portfolio. Proceeds from the sales were reinvested into a core fixed income strategy. As at December 31, 2017, we had a 5.8% (2016 -6.8%) position in equities, a 4.0% (2016 - 3.8%) position in U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt and 0.2% (2016 -0.2%) in risk asset portfolio cash. As at December 31, 2017, approximately 10% of our total cash and investments, excluding catastrophe bonds and funds held by variable interest entities (the Managed Portfolio\u201d), was invested in equities and U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt (2016 - 10.8%).\nBook yield for the year ended December 31, 2017 on the fixed income portfolio was 2.56%, an increase of 7.0 basis points from 2.49% at December 31, 2016, as a result of rising interest rates. Our fixed income portfolio duration as at December 31, 2017 was 3.90 years compared to 3.89 as at December 31, 2016. As at December 31, 2017, the average credit quality of our fixed income portfolio was AA-,\u201d with 88.9% of the portfolio being rated A\u201d or higher. As at December 31, 2016, the average credit quality of our fixed income portfolio was AA-,\u201d with 89.3% of the portfolio being rated A\u201d or higher. Where the credit ratings were split between the two main rating agencies, S&P and Moody's, the lowest rating was used.\nUnrealized gains in the available for sale investment portfolio, net of taxes and including equity securities, were $9.7 million as at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $12.8 million from December 31, 2016.\nAs at December 31, 2017, we had investments in four entities classified as other investments, equity method: a micro-insurance incubator ( MVI\u201d), Bene Assicurazioni ( Bene\u201d), Digital Risk Resources, LLC ( Digital Re\u201d) and Crop Re Services LLC ( Crop Re\u201d).

The estimated cost of claims includes expenses to be incurred in settling claims and a deduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries. Estimated amounts recoverable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are calculated to arrive at a net claims reserve.\nReserves by segment.

Of the total gross reserves for unpaid losses of $6,749.5 million at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2017, a total of $3,720.8 million, or 55.1%, represented IBNR claims (December 31, 2016 - $3,044.9 million and 57.2%, respectively).

The specialty reinsurance business lines reported favorable development and the recognition of additional prior year ceded recoveries in respect of an offshore energy-related loss that occurred in Africa. The casualty reinsurance business line reported a net reserve release due to favorable development despite our exposure to the Ogden rate change from reinsurance of U.K. employer's liability and U.K. public liability business and, to a lesser degree, U.K. motor liability reinsurance.\nInsurance. Net reserve releases of $23.6 million in 2017 were mainly as a result of favorable development and the recognition of additional prior year ceded recoveries in our marine, aviation and energy business line in respect of an offshore energy-related loss that occurred in Africa. Net reserves were strengthened in property and casualty lines due to adverse development in our casualty lines following the change in the Ogden rate which impacted our U.K. employer's liability and U.K. public liability business and increases in loss reserves associated with the purchase of an adverse development cover. Financial and professional lines reported an increase in prior year reserves due to adverse development in the management liability account.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The analysis of the development by each segment is as follows:\nReinsurance. Net reserve releases of $87.0 million in 2016 were attributable to all lines of business. The largest releases in the period were $39.7 million from other property reinsurance lines, $18.9 million from specialty reinsurance lines and $14.9 million from casualty reinsurance lines due to better than expected claims development.\nInsurance. Net reserve releases of $42.3 million in 2017 were attributable to net reserve releases of $38.9 million from marine, aviation and energy lines and $15.3 million from financial and professional lines due to better than expected development partially offset by an $11.9 million net reserve strengthening in property and casualty lines.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The analysis of the development by each segment is as follows:\nReinsurance. Net reserve releases of $90.8 million in 2015 were attributable to all lines of business. The largest releases in the period were $32.6 million from specialty reinsurance lines due primarily to benign incurred experience and $25.5 million from casualty reinsurance and $24.8 million from other property reinsurance lines due to favorable development.\nInsurance. Net reserve releases of $65.7 million in 2015 were largely attributable to net reserve releases of $53.7 million from property and casualty lines and $8.8 million from financial and professional lines. The most significant factor affecting the level of release in 2015 was the release of a small number of case reserves where we saw favorable claims development.\nOther than the matters described under - Critical Accounting Policies - Reserving Approach,\u201d we did not make any significant changes in methodologies used in our reserving process.\nCapital Management\nThe following table shows our capital structures as at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As at December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share capital, additional paid-in capital, retained income and accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to ordinary shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,416.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,851.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preference shares (liquidation preferences net of issue costs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>511.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>797.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>549.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>549.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan Notes issued by Silverton (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,564.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,421.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We do not consider the Loan Notes issued by Silverton to be part of our permanent capital as the noteholders have no recourse to the other assets of the Company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> As at December 31, 2017, total shareholders' equity was $2,928.5 million compared to $3,648.3 million as at December 31, 2016.

Our business operations are in part dependent on our financial strength, the opinions of the independent rating agencies thereof as discussed elsewhere in this report and the market's perception thereof, as measured by total shareholders' equity, which was $2,928.5 million as at December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 - $3,648.3 million). We believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds through debt or equity financing. Our continuing ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other things, our operating results, market conditions and our perceived financial strength. See Risk Factors - We may repurchase additional capital in the future, which may not be available of may only be available on unfavourable terms.\u201d We regularly monitor our capital and financial position, as well as investment and securities market conditions, both in general and with respect to Aspen Holdings' securities. Our ordinary shares and all our preference shares are listed on the NYSE.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short-term and long-term cash requirements of its business operations. Management monitors the liquidity of Aspen Holdings and of each of its Operating Subsidiaries and arranges credit facilities to enhance short-term liquidity resources on a stand-by basis. As a holding company, Aspen Holdings relies on dividends and other distributions from its Operating Subsidiaries to provide cash flow to meet ongoing cash requirements, including any future debt service payments and other expenses, and to pay dividends, if any, to our preference and ordinary shareholders.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, Aspen Holdings received dividends of $360.0 million (2016 - $234.5 million) from Aspen Bermuda and $13.6 million (2016 - $63.4 million) from Aspen European. In addition, Aspen Holdings received $18.7 million in respect of an intercompany loan from Aspen European (2016 - $21.6 million).\nAs at December 31, 2017, Aspen Holdings held $111.4 million (December 31, 2016 - $327.1 million) of cash, cash equivalents and investments with the reduction largely due to the costs associated with the redemption of the 7.401% Preference Shares on January 3, 2017 and the redemption of the 7.250% Preference Shares on July 3, 2017. Management considers the current cash and cash equivalents, together with dividends declared or expected to be declared by subsidiary companies and our credit facilities, sufficient to appropriately satisfy the liquidity requirements of Aspen Holdings. Aspen Holdings' liquidity depends on dividends, capital distributions and interest payments from our Operating Subsidiaries. Aspen Holdings has recourse to the credit facility described below.\nThe ability of our Operating Subsidiaries to pay us dividends or other distributions is subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the Operating Subsidiaries' need to maintain capital requirements adequate to maintain their insurance and reinsurance operations and their financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies. In line with common market practice for regulated institutions, the PRA previously requested that it be afforded with the opportunity to provide a non-objection\u201d prior to all future dividend payments made by Aspen U.K. In 2017, the PRA stated that they no longer routinely require Aspen U.K. to apply for a non-objection to dividends provided that such dividend payment and Aspen U.K.'s subsequent capital position are within Aspen U.K.'s board-approved solvency capital risk appetite. We do not expect to suffer tax on foreign earnings since our significant source of earnings outside of Bermuda is the U.K. and no taxes are imposed on profits repatriated from the U.K. to Bermuda. For a further discussion of the various restrictions on our ability and our Operating Subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, see Part I, Item 1 Business - Regulatory Matters.\u201d For a discussion of the volatility and liquidity of our other investments, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Market and Liquidity Risks,\u201d and for a discussion of the impact of insurance losses on our liquidity, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Insurance Risks\u201d and Note 15 of our consolidated financial statements, Statutory Requirements and Dividend Restrictions.\u201d\nOperating Subsidiaries. As at December 31, 2017, the Operating Subsidiaries held $821.7 million (December 31, 2016 - $1,409.3 million) in cash and short-term investments that are readily realizable securities. The reduction is largely due to the costs associated with the increase in ceded reinsurance and the significant level of claims activity in 2017. Management monitors the value, currency and duration of cash and investments held by its Operating Subsidiaries to ensure they are able to meet their insurance and other liabilities as they become due and, despite the year-on-year decrease, was satisfied that there was a comfortable margin of liquidity as at December 31, 2017 and for the foreseeable future.\nOn an ongoing basis, our Operating Subsidiaries' sources of funds primarily consist of premiums written, investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments. Cash is used primarily to pay reinsurance premiums, losses and loss adjustment expenses, brokerage commissions, general and administrative expenses, taxes, interest and dividends and to purchase new investments. The potential for individual large claims and for accumulations of claims from single events means that substantial and unpredictable payments may need to be made within relatively short periods of time.\nFor all material currencies in which our underwriting activities are written we ensure that sufficient cash and short-term investments are held in such currencies to enable us to meet potential claims without liquidating long-term investments and adversely affecting our investment return. This follows the matching principle which matches our assets and liabilities in currency to mitigate foreign currency risk whenever possible.\nWe manage these risks by making regular forecasts of the timing and amount of expected cash outflows and ensuring that we maintain sufficient balances in cash and short-term investments to meet these estimates. Notwithstanding this policy, if these cash flow forecasts are incorrect, we could be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity, potentially at a significant loss. Historically, we have not had to liquidate investments at a significant loss to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity.\nWhere we incur losses in currencies which are not normally held we will convert funds into the appropriate currencies to mitigate our currency risk and also make funds available to settle claims in local currencies as and when they become due. Recent examples of this have been where we have converted funds to Mexican Peso, Chilean Peso and Chinese Yuan to cover earthquake and other losses in these countries. For local regulatory reasons, we hold assets in trusts which limits our liquidity to some degree. The process of matching assets with liabilities in currency means, however, that at any one time we will hold cash and short-term assets in all major currencies which are available to settle claims.\nThe liquidity of our Operating Subsidiaries is also affected by the terms of our contractual obligations to policyholders and by undertakings to certain regulatory authorities to facilitate the issue of letters of credit or maintain certain balances in trust funds for the benefit of policyholders. The following table shows the forms of collateral or other security provided in respect of these obligations and undertakings as at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As at December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory trusts and deposits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Affiliated transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,455.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,482.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third party\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,425.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,380.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit / guarantees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>658.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>672.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment commitment - real estate fund\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total restricted assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,638.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,535.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total as percent of investable assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 19(a), Commitments and Contingencies - Restricted Assets\u201d of our consolidated financial statements for further detail on our trust fund balances which we are required to maintain in accordance with contractual obligations to policyholders and in compliance with regulatory requirements.\nConsolidated cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Total net cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $(111.5) million, a decrease of $564.7 million from the equivalent period in 2016. The negative cash flows from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were due to the significant increase in ceded reinsurance costs and claims activity in 2017. We paid net claims of $1,555.1 million in 2017 and generated cash inflows of $419.0 million from investing and net purchases and sales of equipment during the period.

Total net cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $453.2 million, a decrease of $121.0 million from the equivalent period in 2015. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, our cash flows from operations provided us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We paid net claims of $1,222.8 million in 2016, and used $350.9 million in investing and net purchases and sales of equipment during the period. We paid ordinary and preference share dividends of $94.5 million, and $75.0 million was used to repurchase ordinary shares.

Total net cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was $574.2 million, a decrease of $33.2 million from the equivalent period in 2014. For the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2015, our cash flows from operations provided us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We paid net claims of $1,108.5 million in 2015, and used $501.9 million in investing and net purchases and sales of equipment during the period. We paid ordinary and preference share dividends of $88.7 million, and $83.7 million was used to repurchase ordinary shares.

As at December 31, 2017, Peregrine had formed four segregated accounts which were funded by a third party investor. The segregated accounts have not been consolidated as part of the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations by its effect on interest rates and on the cost of settling claims. The potential exists after a catastrophe or other large property loss, such as the hurricanes in 2017, for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy as the demand for services, such as construction, typically surges. The cost of settling claims may also be increased by global commodity price inflation. We seek to take both these factors into account when setting reserves for any events where we think they may be material.\nOur calculation of reserves for losses and loss expenses in respect of casualty business includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims-handling expenses, such as medical treatments and litigation costs. We write casualty\nbusiness in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia and certain other territories, where claims inflation has in many years run at higher rates than general inflation. To the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims, we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in earnings. The actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled.\nIn addition to general price inflation, we are exposed to a persisting long-term upwards trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages. We seek to take this into account in our pricing and reserving of casualty business.\nWe also seek to take into account the projected impact of inflation on the likely actions of central banks in the setting of short-term interest rates and consequent effects on the yields and prices of fixed interest securities. As at February 2018, although inflation is currently low, we consider that in the medium-term there is a risk that inflation, interest rates and bond yields may rise, resulting in a decrease in the market value of certain of our fixed interest investments. See Risk Factors - Our results of operations and investment portfolio may be materially affected by conditions impacting the level of interest rates in the global capital markets and major economies, such as central bank policies in interest rates and the rate of inflation.\u201d\nReconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted diluted book value per ordinary share, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, is calculated by deducting from total shareholders' equity the total of: accumulated other comprehensive income; the value of preference shares less issue expenses; the share of equity due to non-controlling interests; and adding back ordinary dividends. The resulting balance is then divided by the diluted number of ordinary shares as at the year end. We believe that adding back ordinary dividends provides a more consistent and useful measurement of total shareholder value, which supplements U.S. GAAP information. We have excluded accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments is primarily the result of interest rate movements and the resultant impact on fixed income securities, and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign exchange is the result of exchange rate movements between the U.S. Dollar and the functional currencies of our Operating Subsidiaries. Therefore, we believe that excluding these unrealized appreciations (depreciations) provides a more consistent and useful measurement of operating performance, which supplements U.S. GAAP information.\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As at December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As at December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions, except for share amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,928.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,648.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preference shares less issue expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(511.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(797.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-controlling interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ordinary dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,526.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,907.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ordinary shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,474,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,774,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted ordinary shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,202,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,001,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book Value Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage equity, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, is used in calculating ordinary shareholders return on average equity.

We exclude after-tax net realized and unrealized capital gains or losses, after-tax net foreign exchange gains or losses and changes in the fair value of derivatives from our calculation of operating income because the amount of these gains or losses is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part, according to the availability of market opportunities. We believe these amounts are largely independent of our business and underwriting process and including them distorts the analysis of trends in its operations. In addition to presenting net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe that showing operating income enables investors, analysts, rating agencies and other users of our financial information to more easily analyze our results of operations in a manner similar to how management analyzes our underlying business performance.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related Notes contained in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and particularly under the headings Risk Factors,\u201d Business\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d contained in Item 1A, Item 1, and Part I of this report, respectively.\nAspen's Year in Review\nThe insurance and reinsurance industry continued to be challenged in 2017 as a result of the impact of a series of costly catastrophe events and losses. In addition, although rates generally increased following the catastrophes in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, the industry has experienced years of rate reductions across many lines of business in both insurance and reinsurance.\nBusiness Portfolio Optimization. In 2017, we launched a comprehensive program to enhance operating effectiveness and efficiency across our organization and enhance our market position (the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program\u201d). The Effectiveness and Efficiency Program is intended to allow us to be a more nimble organization with faster decision-making ability and a more competitive expense ratio.\nWe expect the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program to deliver cumulative total expense savings of approximately $160 million over the next three years. We expect to achieve approximately $30 million of the savings in 2018, $55 million in 2019 and $75 million in 2020, after which run-rate savings are expected to be approximately $80 million per year. We expect approximately 70% of the total expected savings to benefit our Insurance segment. We likewise expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $95 million to implement the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program and achieve the expected savings, the majority of which we expect will be incurred in 2018 and 2019. Approximately $50 million of this charge is for employee severance, benefits and related expenses, $30 million for business transformation and Effectiveness and Efficiency Program costs, and $15 million for outsourcing and premises. We also expect to spend a total of approximately $55 million in incremental capital expenditure, primarily information technology, in 2018 and 2019 that we expect to be amortized over a period of three to five years from the start of 2020. In 2017, we have recognized $15.2 million of expense associated with the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program.\nIn our insurance segment, we experienced a significant underwriting loss due to a combination of catastrophe losses and an increased incidence of large losses and attritional losses. Gross written premium for the insurance segment was $1.81 billion in 2017, an increase of 4.5% from 2016. Our combined ratio in insurance was 117.9% in 2017 compared to 99.6% in 2016.\nIn our reinsurance segment, our results were dominated by the significant level of natural catastrophe losses primarily in the U.S. Gross written premium for the reinsurance segment for 2017 was $1.55 billion, an increase of 9.6% from 2016, with growth primarily in specialty lines. The combined ratio was 125.1% in 2017 compared to 90.0% in 2016.\nOn December 18, 2017, the Company acquired through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Aspen U.S. Holdings, a 23.2% share of Crop Re Services LLC ( Crop Re\u201d), a newly formed U.S.-based subsidiary of CGB Diversified Services, Inc ( CGB DS\u201d) in exchange for the sale of AG Logic Holdings, LLC and its affiliates ( AgriLogic\u201d), the Company's U.S. crop insurance business. For further information regarding this transaction, see Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements, Investments.\u201d\nTotal ceded written premiums in 2017 increased by $595.1 million compared to 2016. Ceded written premiums increased in both our insurance and reinsurance segments due to the purchase of a whole account quota share contract. Ceded reinsurance premiums increased for our insurance segment due to the restructure of our ceded reinsurance arrangements through the use of significant quota share reinsurance arrangements and the recognition of ceded premiums to reinstate cover following catastrophe and other large losses. Ceded premiums also increased in the reinsurance segment due to increased gross written premiums written in conjunction with increased retrocession to third parties, an increase in ceded reinsurance premiums following the sale of AgriLogic in December 2017 and due to the recognition of additional ceded premiums as a result of reinstating cover following catastrophe losses.\nCapital Management. We continue to focus on capital management and maintain our capital at an appropriate level. In 2017, we repurchased 648,941 ordinary shares for a total consideration of $30.0 million. In addition, in the second quarter of 2017, we increased our quarterly dividend on our ordinary shares from $0.22 to $0.24 per ordinary share. On February 8, 2017, our Board of Directors also authorized a new share repurchase program of $250.0 million. The share repurchase authorization, which is effective through February 8, 2019, permits us to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of transactions.\nOn January 3, 2017, we also elected to redeem all of the outstanding 7.401% Preference Shares. Each holder of a 7.401% Preference Share received $25 per 7.401% Preference Share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends. We likewise elected to redeem all of the outstanding 7.250% Preference Shares on July 3, 2017. Each holder of a 7.250% Preference Share received $25 per 7.250% Preference Share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends.\nInvestment Management. We follow an investment strategy designed to emphasize the preservation of capital and provide sufficient liquidity for the prompt payment of claims. As of December 31, 2017, our investments consisted of a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities including U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt, global equities and money market funds. Our overall portfolio strategy remains focused on high quality fixed income investments. In the third quarter of 2017, we took advantage of rising equity markets and sold $208.1 million of our equity portfolio. Proceeds from the sales were reinvested into a core fixed income strategy. As at December 31, 2017, we had a 5.8% (2016 -6.8%) position in equities, a 4% (2016 - 3.8%) position in U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt and 0.2% (2016 -0.2%) in risk asset portfolio cash. As at December 31, 2017, approximately 10% of our total cash and investments, excluding catastrophe bonds and funds held by variable interest entities (the Managed Portfolio\u201d), was invested in equities and U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt (2016 - 10.8%).\nFinancial Overview\nThe following overview of our 2017, 2016 and 2015 operating results and financial condition is intended to identify important themes and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion further below.\nOperating highlights\n \u2022 Gross written premiums of $3,360.9 million in 2017, an increase of 6.8% from 2016. \n \u2022 Combined ratio of 125.7% for 2017, including $561.9 million, or 24.6 percentage points of pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatements, compared with 98.5% for 2016, which included $164.4 million or 6.3 percentage points of pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatements, and 91.9% for 2015, which included $90.5 million or 3.7 percentage points of pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatements. \n \u2022 Net favorable development on prior year loss reserves of $105.4 million, or 4.6 combined ratio points, for 2017 compared with $129.3 million, or 4.9 combined ratio points, for 2016, and $156.5 million, or 6.3 combined ratio points, for 2015. \n \u2022 Annualized net return on average equity of an 11.1% loss for 2017 compared with a 5.4% gain in 2016 and a 10.0% gain in 2015.

In 2016 gross written premiums increased by 5.0% compared to 2015 due primarily to growth in specialty reinsurance and casualty reinsurance business lines.\nCeded written premiums. Ceded written premiums in 2017 increased by 107.6% compared to 2016.

Ceded written premiums increased in our insurance segment due to the restructuring of our ceded reinsurance arrangements and the recognition of reinstatement premiums associated with the increase in catastrophe and large losses. Ceded written premiums increased in our reinsurance segment due to new business opportunities written in conjunction with increased retrocession, additional ceded written premiums following the sale of AgriLogic in December 2017 and the recognition of reinstatement premiums associated with the increase in catastrophe losses.\nCeded written premiums increased by 57.6% in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of new business opportunities written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession, and as a result of a restructure of our ceded reinsurance arrangements aimed at reducing earnings volatility and benefiting the expense ratio through an increase in over-rider commissions.\nCombined ratio. We monitor the ratio of losses and expenses to net earned premium (the combined ratio\u201d) as a measure of relative performance where a lower ratio represents a better result than a higher ratio. The combined ratios for our two business segments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Combined Ratios for the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n (1) The total combined ratio includes the impact from corporate expenses.  The combined ratio for 2017 increased by 27.2 percentage points compared to 2016 due mainly to the increase in the loss ratio. The increase in loss ratio was due primarily to a $409.6 million increase in catastrophe losses, a $59.7 million increase in large losses, a $23.9 million decrease in prior year reserve releases, an increase in attritional losses in our insurance segment and a $330.7 million decrease in net earned premiums. The expense ratio increased by 0.5 percentage point due to a reduction in net earned premiums and an increase in general, administrative and corporate expenses partially offset by a decrease in policy acquisition expenses due to over-rider commissions associated with the increase in ceded reinsurance.\nThe combined ratio for 2016 increased by 6.6 percentage points compared to 2015 due to a 4.6 percentage point increase in the loss ratio and a 2.0 percentage point increase in the expense ratio. The loss ratio increase was due primarily to a $75.9 million increase in catastrophe losses and a $27.2 million reduction in the level of prior year reserve releases. The increase in expense ratio was due to higher acquisition and general administrative and corporate expenses. The increase in the expense ratio was due to an increase in the acquisition ratio due to higher profit commission accruals and lower ceding commissions in the insurance segment and changes in business mix in the reinsurance segment. The increase in general, administrative and corporate expenses was due to costs associated with AgriLogic, growth in our insurance and reinsurance business and reorganization costs.\nIn each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a reduction in the level of reserves for prior years. In 2017, we reported net favorable development on prior year loss reserves of $105.4 million, or 4.6 combined ratio points, compared with $129.3 million, or 4.9 combined ratio points, for 2016, and $156.5 million, or 6.3 combined ratio points, for 2015.\nOverall reserve releases in 2017 decreased by $23.9 million compared to 2016 mainly due to an $18.7 million decrease in net reserve releases in our insurance segment from $42.3 million in 2016 to $23.6 million in 2017. Overall reserve releases in 2016 reduced by $27.2 million compared to 2015 due mainly to a $23.4 million decrease in net reserve releases in our insurance segment from $65.7 million in 2015 to $42.3 million in 2016. Reserve releases in our reinsurance segment in 2015 decreased from $90.8 million in 2015 to $87.0 million in 2016. Further information relating to the release of reserves can be found below under - Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Prior Year Loss Reserves.\u201d\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to an increase in over-rider commissions associated with the increase in ceded reinsurance. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased in 2016 compared to 2015 in line with premium growth and higher profit commission accruals and lower ceding commissions in the insurance segment offsetting the Federal Excise Tax ( FET\u201d) refunds and changes in business mix in the reinsurance segment.\nGeneral, administrative and corporate expenses increased to $502.2 million in 2017 from $490.1 million in 2016 and $424.0 million in 2015. The increase in such expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was largely due to $15.2 million of costs associated with the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program and increased costs associated with growth in our insurance business partially offset by lower provisions for performance-related remuneration. The increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was largely due to costs associated with AgriLogic which we acquired in January 2016 (and subsequently sold in December 2017), costs associated with growth in our insurance and reinsurance business and reorganization costs.\nNet investment income. We generated net investment income of $189.0 million in 2017, an increase of 1.0% on the prior year (2016 - $187.1 million; 2015 - $185.5 million). The increase was primarily due to the increase in the book yield of the fixed income portfolio. The increase in investment income in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a higher investment balance and $20.4 million of dividend income from our global equity securities portfolio compared with $20.1 million in 2015.\nTaxes. We recognized a tax credit in 2017 of $15.4 million (2016 - $6.1 million expense; 2015 - $14.4 million expense), equivalent to a consolidated rate on our loss before tax of 5.5% in 2017 compared to a consolidated rate on our profit before tax of 2.9% in 2016 and 4.3% in 2015. The income tax credit for 2017 takes into account a tax credit associated with the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d and a tax credit regarding deductions available for certain research and development expenditure. The tax credit in 2017 has not been materially affected by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was\nsigned on December 22, 2017. The impact of the U.S. federal income tax rate reduction from 34% to 21% has been reflected in measuring deferred taxes.\nThe effective tax rate for the year is subject to revision in future periods if circumstances change and depends on the relative profitability of the business underwritten in Bermuda (where the rate of tax on corporate profits is zero), the United Kingdom (where the corporation tax rate is 19% and will be reduced to 17% effective April 1, 2020) and the United States (where the federal income tax rate was previously 34% and has been reduced to 21% effective January 1, 2018). The tax in each of the years is representative of the geographic spread of our business between taxable and non-taxable jurisdictions in such years.\nNet income. We reported a net loss after taxes of $266.4 million in 2017 compared to net income of $203.4 million in 2016 and net income of $323.1 million in 2015. The net loss in 2017 was primarily due to the $625.5 million decrease in underwriting income resulting mainly from a $409.6 million increase in catastrophe losses, a $330.7 million reduction in net earned premiums and a $23.9 million reduction in reserve releases, partially offset by a $116.3 million reduction in expenses. The decrease in income after tax in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to a $137.7 million decrease in underwriting income resulting from higher catastrophe losses, lower reserve releases and increased expenses partially offset by growth in premiums earned.\nOther comprehensive income. Total other comprehensive income decreased by $50.8 million (2016 - $64.7 million decrease), net of taxes, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. This consists of a net unrealized loss of $9.2 million in the available for sale investment portfolio (2016 - $28.8 million net unrealized loss) largely attributable to the impact of rising interest rates on our bond portfolios, a $3.6 million reclassification of net realized gains to net income (2016 - $8.9 million reclassified realized gains), a $2.6 million unrealized gain (2016 - $0.7 million unrealized gain) on the hedged derivative contracts and an unrealized loss in foreign currency translation of $40.6 million (2016 -$27.7 million unrealized loss) largely attributable to the impact from the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nDividends. In April 2017, the Board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our ordinary shares from $0.22 per ordinary share to $0.24 per ordinary share (2016 - $0.22 quarterly dividend; 2015 - $0.20 quarterly dividend). This resulted in total ordinary dividends for 2017 of $56.2 million (2016 - $52.7 million; 2015 - $50.9 million). Dividends paid on the outstanding Preference Shares in 2017 were $36.2 million (2016 - $41.8 million; 2015 - $37.8 million). The reduction in dividends in 2017 was due to the redemption of the 7.401% and 7.250% Preference Shares.\nShareholders' equity and financial leverage. Total shareholders' equity decreased by $719.8 million from $3,648.3 million as at December 31, 2016 to $2,928.5 million as at December 31, 2017. The most significant movements were:\n \u2022 a decrease of $365.4 million in retained earnings due to the net loss of $266.4 million and the payment of $92.4 million in ordinary and preference share dividends; \n \u2022 a reduction of $50.8 million in other comprehensive income; \n \u2022 the redemption of $133.2 million 5,327,500 7.401% Preference Shares; \n \u2022 the redemption of $160.0 million 6,400,000 7.250% Preference Shares; and \n \u2022 the repurchase of 648,941 ordinary shares for $30.0 million through open market and other repurchases.  As at December 31, 2017, our total shareholders' equity included Preference Shares with a total value as measured by their respective liquidation preferences of $525.0 million (2016 - $818.2 million) less issue costs of $13.1 million (2016 - $21.1 million).\nOur senior notes were the only material debt issued by Aspen Holdings as at December 31, 2017 and 2016 totaling $549.5 million and $549.3 million, respectively. In addition to the senior notes, we also reported $86.6 million (2016 - $223.4 million) of debt issued by Silverton. For further information relating to Silverton, refer to Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements, Variable Interest Entities.\u201d\nManagement monitors the ratio of the total of debt and hybrids to total capital, with total capital being defined as shareholders' equity plus outstanding debt and excluding loan notes issued by variable interest entities. As at December 31, 2017, the debt to capital ratio was 15.8% (2016 - 13.1%). The ratio increased due to the reduction in our retained earnings as a result of the increase in catastrophe losses impacting both our insurance and reinsurance segments, an increased frequency of large and attritional losses in our insurance segment and the redemption of the 7.401% Preference Shares and 7.250% Preference Shares in 2017. The Preference Shares are classified in our balance sheet as equity but may receive a different treatment in some cases under the capital adequacy assessments made by certain rating agencies. We also monitor the ratio of the total debt and the liquidation preference of our Preference Shares to total capital which was 30.5% as at December 31, 2017 (2016 - 32.1%). The ratio reduced due to the redemption of the 7.401% Preference Shares and 7.250% Preference Shares in 2017.\nDiluted book value per ordinary share as at December 31, 2017 was $40.10, a decrease of 14.2% compared to $46.72 as at December 31, 2016. Book value per ordinary share is based on total shareholders' equity, less preference shares (liquidation preference less issue expenses) and non-controlling interests, divided by the number of ordinary shares in issue at the end of the period.\nBalances as at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As at December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions, except for share amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,928.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,648.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preference shares less issue expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(511.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(797.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net assets attributable to ordinary shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,413.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,849.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issued ordinary shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,474,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,774,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issued and potentially dilutive ordinary shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,202,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,001,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMarket Conditions, Rate Trends and Developments\nOverall, the rate environment has improved in both our reinsurance and insurance segments following one of the costliest years of catastrophe losses on record in 2017.\nWe achieved an overall rate increase of approximately 6% for our reinsurance business during the January 1, 2018 renewals where we renewed approximately 50% of our annual book of reinsurance business. In addition, our Aspen Capital Markets business continues to provide investors with direct access to our underwriting expertise, and to provide brokers and clients with additional capacity. It also gives us the flexibility to manage our exposures.\nWhile the January 1, 2018 renewals are less important for our insurance business, we achieved double digit percentage rate increases in marine and energy liability, marine hull, U.S. ocean marine and U.S. property and we obtained approximately 5% to 10% rate increases in U.S. energy and U.S. environmental. We achieved a rate increase of approximately 14% for our U.S. property book in conjunction with improved terms and conditions. Other insurance lines of business achieved up to 4% rate increases during the January 1, 2018 renewals.\nFollowing the large catastrophe losses in 2017, we continue to seek to balance our insurance portfolio and to target the best risk-adjusted returns. As a result, we expect to reduce our exposure to major property accounts that contain considerable catastrophe accumulations. As a result of the increased frequency of large and attritional losses in our insurance segment in 2017, we have likewise taken a more risk-averse view by retaining less risk and ceding more premiums with the aim to stabilize earnings. We have also significantly reduced our voluntary participation into our internal reinsurance vehicle. As a result of these actions, we expect our net written premium to gross written premium ratio to reduce to 60% in 2018.\nWe continue to expect that our Effectiveness and Efficiency Program will deliver savings of approximately $30 million in 2018, $55 million in 2019 and $75 million in 2020, after which run-rate savings are expected to be approximately $80 million per year. As a result of the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program, we expect our total expense ratio to continue to decline over the next three years.\nIn addition, we expect the recently enacted U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to have a modest impact on the amount of tax that we will pay. We expect that the U.S. tax bill will decrease net income by approximately $10 million or more in 2018 although the ultimate impact will depend on where our profits are generated.\nSee Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included in this report.\nRecent Developments\nOn January 5, 2018, we notified the Prudential Regulation Authority of our intention to close Aspen U.K.'s branches in Paris, France and Cologne, Germany. We expect these branches to be closed during the first quarter of 2018.\nDuring January 2018, we sold $206.9 million of equity securities from our investment portfolio and realized a net gain of $36.7 million.\nOn January 26, 2018, S&P affirmed the ratings of our Operating Subsidiaries but changed their outlook to negative from stable. On February 6, 2018, Moody's affirmed the ratings of our Operating Subsidiaries but changed their outlook to negative from stable. Both rating agencies stated certain factors which, if not achieved, could lead the relevant rating agency to downgrade the ratings of our Operating Subsidiaries. See Risk Factors - Our Operating Subsidiaries are rated and our Lloyd's business benefits from a rating by one or more of A.M. Best, S&P and Moody's and a decline in any of these ratings could adversely affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our premiums and earnings to decrease and limit our ability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares\u201d for a discussion of some potential risks relating to our ratings.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective in nature and require management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine the reported values. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. A statement of all the significant accounting policies we use to prepare our financial statements is included in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. If factors such as those described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d cause actual events to differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting policy and calculating financial results, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nWritten Premiums\nWritten premiums comprise the estimated premiums on contracts of insurance and reinsurance entered into in the reporting period, except in the case of proportional reinsurance contracts, where written premiums relate only to our estimated proportional share of premiums due on contracts entered into by the ceding company prior to the end of the reporting period.\nAll premium estimates are reviewed regularly, comparing actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums along with a review of the collectability of premiums receivable. Based on management's review, the appropriateness of the premium estimates is evaluated, and any adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the periods in which they become known. Adjustments to original premium estimates could be material and these adjustments may directly and significantly impact earnings in the period they are determined because the subject premium may be fully or substantially earned.\nWe refer to premiums receivable which are not fixed at the inception of the contract as adjustment premiums. The proportion of adjustment premiums included in the premium estimates varies between business lines with the largest adjustment premiums associated with property and casualty reinsurance business and the smallest with property and liability insurance lines.\nAdjustment premiums are most significant in relation to reinsurance contracts. Different considerations apply to non-proportional and proportional treaties as follows:\nNon-proportional treaties. A large number of the reinsurance contracts we write are written on a non-proportional or excess of loss treaty basis. As the ultimate level of business written by each cedant can only be estimated at the time the reinsurance is placed, the reinsurance contracts generally stipulate a minimum and deposit premium payable under the contract with an adjustable premium determined by variables such as the number of contracts covered by the reinsurance, the total premium received by the cedant and the nature of the exposures assumed. Minimum and deposit premiums generally cover the majority of premiums due under such treaty reinsurance contracts and the adjustable portion of the premium is usually a small portion of the total premium receivable. For excess of loss contracts, the minimum and deposit premium, as defined in the contract, is generally considered to be the best estimate of the contract's written premium at inception. Accordingly, this is the amount we generally record as written premium in the period the underlying risks incept.\nDuring the life of a contract, notifications from cedants and brokers may affect the estimate of ultimate premium and result in either increases or reductions in reported revenue. Changes in estimated adjustable premiums do not generally have a significant impact on short-term liquidity as the payment of adjustment premiums generally occurs after the expiration of a contract.\nMany non-proportional treaties also include a provision for the payment to us by the cedant of reinstatement premiums based on loss experience under such contracts. Reinstatement premiums are the premiums charged for the restoration of the reinsurance limit of an excess of loss contract to its full amount after payment by the reinsurer of losses as a result of an occurrence. These premiums relate to the future coverage obtained during the remainder of the initial policy term and are included in revenue in the same period as the corresponding losses.\nProportional treaties ( treaty pro rata\u201d). Estimates of premiums assumed under treaty pro rata reinsurance contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks are expected to incept and are based on information provided by brokers and ceding companies and estimates of the underlying economic conditions at the time the risk is underwritten. We estimate premiums\nreceivable initially and update our premium estimates regularly throughout the contract term based on treaty statements received from the ceding company.\nThe reported gross written premiums for treaty pro rata business include estimates of premiums due to us but not yet reported by the cedant because of time delays between contracts being written by our cedants and their submission of treaty statements to us. This additional premium is normally described as pipeline premium. Treaty statements disclose information on the underlying contracts of insurance written by our cedants and are generally submitted on a monthly or quarterly basis, from 30 to 90 days in arrears. In order to report all risks incepting prior to a period end, we estimate the premiums written between the last submitted treaty statement and the period end. Treaty pro rata premiums are written predominantly in our other property, specialty and casualty reinsurance line of business.\nProperty treaty pro rata made a significant contribution to our reinsurance segment where we wrote $242.5 million in gross written premium in 2017 (2016 - $226.7 million), or 15.7% of the gross written premium in our reinsurance segment, of which $76.6 million was estimated (2016 - $53.1 million) and $165.9 million was reported by the cedants (2016 - $173.6 million). Excluding the impact of fixed costs, such as reinsurance premiums and operating expenses, we estimate that the impact of a $1.0 million increase / decrease in our estimated gross written premiums in our property treaty pro rata business would increase / decrease net income before tax by approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 (2016 - $0.1 million increase /decrease).\nThe most likely drivers of change in our premium estimates in decreasing order of magnitude are:\n \u2022 changes in the renewal rate or rate of new business acceptances by the cedant insurance companies leading to lower or greater volumes of ceded premiums than our estimate, which could result from changes in the relevant primary market that could affect more than one of our cedants or could be a consequence of changes in marketing strategy or risk appetite by a particular cedant; \n \u2022 changes in the rates being charged by cedants; and \n \u2022 differences between the pattern of inception dates assumed in our estimate and the actual pattern of inception dates.  We anticipate that ultimate premiums might reasonably be expected to vary by up to 5% as a result of variations in one or more of the assumptions described above, although larger variations are possible. Based on gross written premiums of $242.5 million (2016 - $226.7 million) in our property reinsurance treaty pro rata account as at December 31, 2017, a variation of 5% could increase or reduce net income before tax by approximately $1.2 million (2016 - $0.5 million).\nEarned premiums. Premiums are recognized as earned over the policy exposure periods. The premium related to the unexpired portion of each policy at the end of the reporting period is included in the balance sheet as unearned premiums.\nReserving Approach\nWe are required by U.S. GAAP to establish loss reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses ( ultimate losses\u201d) under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers. Our loss reserves comprise the following components:\n \u2022 the cost of claims reported to us but not yet paid known as case reserves ( case reserves\u201d); \n \u2022 IBNR reserves to cover the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not reported. Within this, we also include the potential development of reported claims; and \n \u2022 the expenses associated with settling claims, including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process, known as the loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d).  Prior to the selection of the reserves to be included in our financial statements, our actuarial team employs a number of techniques to establish a range of estimates from which they consider it reasonable for management to select a \u2018best estimate' (the actuarial range\u201d).\nCase Reserves. For reported claims, reserves are established on a case-by-case basis within the parameters of coverage provided in the insurance policy or reinsurance agreement. The method of establishing case reserves for reported claims differs among our operations. With respect to our insurance operations, we are advised of potential insured losses and our claims handlers record reserves for the estimated amount of the expected indemnity settlement, loss adjustment expenses and cost of defense where appropriate. The reserve estimate reflects the judgment of the claims personnel and is based on claim information obtained to date, general reserving practices, the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature of the specific claim and where appropriate and available, advice from legal counsel, loss adjusters and other claims experts.\nWith respect to our reinsurance claims operations, claims handlers set case reserves for reported claims generally based on the claims reports received from our ceding companies and take into consideration our cedants' own reserve recommendations and our prior loss experience with the cedant. Additional case reserves ( ACR\u201d), in addition to the cedants' own recommended reserves, may be established by us to reflect our estimated ultimate cost of a loss. ACRs are generally the result of either a claims handler's own experience and knowledge of handling similar claims, general reserving practices or the result of reserve recommendations following an audit of cedants' reserves.\nCase reserves are based on a subjective judgment of facts and circumstances and are established for the purposes of internal reserving only. Accordingly, they do not represent a commitment to any course of conduct or admission of liability on our behalf in relation to any specific claim.\nIBNR Reserves. The need for IBNR reserves arises from time lags between when a loss occurs and when it is actually reported and settled. By definition, we do not have specific information on IBNR claims so they need to be estimated by actuarial methodologies. IBNR reserves are therefore generally calculated at an aggregate level and cannot generally be identified as reserves for a particular loss or contract. We calculate IBNR reserves by class of business within each line of business. Where appropriate, analyses may be conducted on sub-sets of a class of business. IBNR reserves are calculated by projecting our ultimate losses on each class of business and subtracting paid losses and case reserves. IBNR reserves also cover the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not reported, within this we also include any potential development of reported claims. Over recent years, we have begun to place greater reliance on our actual actuarial experience for our long-tail lines of business that we have written since our inception in 2002. We believe that our earliest accident years are now capable of providing us with meaningful actuarial indications. Estimates and judgments for new insurance and reinsurance lines of business are more difficult to make than those made for more mature lines of business because we have more limited historical information through December 31, 2017.\nSources of Information. Claims information received typically includes the loss date, details of the claim, the recommended reserve and reports from the loss adjusters dealing with the claim. In respect of pro rata treaties and any business written through managing general agents, we receive regular statements (bordereaux) which provide paid and outstanding claims information, often with large losses separately identified. Following widely reported loss events, such as catastrophes and airplane crashes, we adopt a proactive approach to establish our likely exposure to claims by reviewing policy listings and contacting brokers and policyholders as appropriate.\nActuarial Methodologies. The main projection methodologies that are used by our actuaries are as follows:\n \u2022 Initial expected loss ratio ( IELR\u201d) method: This method calculates an estimate of ultimate losses by applying an estimated loss ratio to an estimate of ultimate earned premium for each accident year. The estimated loss ratio may be based on pricing information and/or industry data and/or historical claims experience revalued to the year under review. \n \u2022 Bornhuetter-Ferguson ( BF\u201d) method: The BF method uses as a starting point an assumed IELR and blends in the loss ratio, which is implied by the claims experience to date using benchmark loss development patterns on paid claims data ( Paid BF\u201d) or reported claims data ( Reported BF\u201d). Although the method tends to provide less volatile indications at early stages of development and reflects changes in the external environment, it can be slow to react to emerging loss development and can, if the IELR proves to be inaccurate, produce loss estimates which take longer to converge with the final settlement value of loss. \n \u2022 Loss development ( Chain Ladder\u201d) method: This method uses actual loss data and the historical development profiles on older accident years to project more recent, less developed years to their ultimate position. \n \u2022 Exposure-based method: This method is typically used for specific large catastrophic events such as a major hurricane. All exposure is identified and we work with known market information and information from our cedants to determine a percentage of the exposure to be taken as the ultimate loss.  In addition to these methodologies, our actuaries may use other approaches depending upon the characteristics of the class of business and available data.\nIn general terms, the IELR method is most appropriate for classes of business and/or accident years where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet mature enough to modify our initial expectations of the ultimate loss ratios. Typical examples would be recent accident years for classes of business in casualty reinsurance. The BF method is generally appropriate where there are few reported claims and a relatively less stable pattern of reported losses. Typical examples would be our treaty risk excess class of business in our reinsurance segment and marine hull class of business in our insurance segment. The Chain Ladder method is appropriate when there are relatively stable patterns of loss emergence and a relatively large number of reported claims. Typical examples are the U.K. commercial property and U.K. commercial liability classes of business in our international insurance business.\nReserving Procedures and Process. Our actuaries calculate the IELR, BF and Chain Ladder and, if appropriate, other methods for each class of business and each accident year. They then calculate a single point actuarial mean best estimate ( ultimate\u201d) for each class of business and provide a stochastic distribution around the mean for each line of business. The actuarial methodologies involve significant subjective judgments reflecting many factors, including but not limited to, changes in legislative conditions, changes in judicial interpretation of legal liability policy coverages and inflation. Our actuaries collaborate with our underwriting, claims, legal and finance teams in identifying factors which are incorporated in their range of ultimates in which management's best estimate is most likely to fall. The actuarial stochastic distribution is designed to provide management with a range from which it is reasonable to select a single management best estimate for inclusion in our financial statements.\nThere are no differences between our year-end and our quarterly internal reserving procedures and processes because our actuaries perform the basic projections and analyses described above for each class of business quarterly.\nSelection of Reported Gross Reserves. Management, through its Reserve Committees, reviews the actuarial stochastic distribution and any other evidence before selecting its management best estimate of reserves for each line of business. Management selects the management best estimate\u201d by considering all the information provided to them and by considering the risks and uncertainties within the actuarial mean best estimate. Management has to date selected its best estimate above that of the actuarial mean best estimate and within the range of the actuarial stochastic distribution. This provides the basis for the recommendation to the Audit Committee and the Board made by management regarding the reserve amounts and related disclosures to be recorded in our financial statements.\nThere are three Reserve Committees, one for each of the insurance and reinsurance segments and a core\u201d committee that makes final reserving recommendations. The core\u201d Reserve Committee currently consists of the Group Chief Risk Officer (the chair), the Group Head of Capital Management, the Group Head of Risk, the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Insurance Chief Financial Officer and the President and Chief Underwriting Officer of Aspen Re. Senior members of the insurance and reinsurance segment underwriting and claims staff comprise the remaining members of each of the insurance and reinsurance reserve committees, respectively.\nEach class of business within each line of business is reviewed in detail by management through its Reserve Committee at least once a year. The timing of such reviews varies throughout the year. Additionally, we review the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations every fiscal quarter for all classes of business. If warranted from this analysis, we may accelerate the timing of our detailed actuarial reviews.\nUncertainties. While the management selected reserves make a reasonable provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense obligations, we note that the process of estimating required reserves, by its very nature, involves uncertainty and therefore the ultimate claims may fall outside the actuarial range. The level of uncertainty can be influenced by such factors as the existence of coverage with long duration reporting patterns and changes in claims handling practices, as well as the other factors described above.\nBecause many of the coverages underwritten involve claims that may not be ultimately settled for many years after they are incurred, subjective judgments as to the ultimate exposure to losses are an integral and necessary component of the loss reserving process. We review our reserves regularly, using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claims costs, frequency and severity data, and prevailing economic, social and legal factors. Reserves established in prior periods are adjusted as claims experience develops and new information becomes available.\nEstimates of IBNR are generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than estimates of the cost of settling claims already notified to us, where more information about the claim event is generally available. IBNR claims often may not be apparent to the insured until many years after the event giving rise to the claims has happened. Classes of business where the IBNR proportion of the total reserve is high, such as casualty insurance, will typically display greater variations between initial estimates and final outcomes because of the greater degree of difficulty of estimating these reserves.\nClasses of business where claims are typically reported relatively quickly after the claim event tend to display lower levels of volatility between initial estimates and final outcomes. Reinsurance claims are subject to a longer time lag both in their reporting and in their time to final settlement. The time lag is a factor which is included in the projections to ultimate claims within the actuarial analyses and helps to explain why in general a higher proportion of the initial reinsurance reserves are represented by IBNR than for insurance reserves for business in the same class. Delays in receiving information from cedants are an expected part of normal business operations and are included within the statistical estimate of IBNR to the extent that current levels of backlog are consistent with historical data. Currently, there are no processing backlogs which would materially affect our financial statements.\nAllowance is made, however, for changes or uncertainties which may create distortions in the underlying statistics or which might cause the cost of unsettled claims to increase or reduce when compared with the cost of previously settled claims, including:\n \u2022 changes in our processes which might accelerate or slow down the development and/or recording of paid or incurred claims; \n \u2022 changes in the legal environment (including challenges to tort reform); \n \u2022 the effects of inflation; \n \u2022 changes in the mix of business; \n \u2022 the impact of large losses; and \n \u2022 changes in our cedants' reserving methodologies.  These factors are incorporated in the recommended reserve range from which management selects its best point estimate. We take all reasonable steps to ensure that we utilize all appropriate information and actuarial techniques in establishing our IBNR reserves. However, given the uncertainty in establishing claims liabilities, it is likely that the final outcome will prove to be different from the original provision established at the balance sheet date. Changes to our previous estimates of prior period loss reserves impact the reported calendar year underwriting results by worsening our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be deficient or improving our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant. As at December 31, 2017, a 5% change in the gross reserve for IBNR losses would have equated to a change of approximately $186.0 million in loss reserves which would represent 66.0% of loss before income tax for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. As at December 31, 2016, a 5% change in the gross reserve for IBNR losses would have equated to a change of approximately $152.2 million in loss reserves which would represent 72.6% of income before income tax for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. A 5% change in our net loss reserves equates to $261.7 million and represents 5.0% of shareholders' equity as at December 31, 2017.\nThere are specific areas of our selected reserves which have additional uncertainty associated with them. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors -Insurance Risks - Our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected if actual claims exceed our loss reserves\u201d for a discussion of the specific areas of our selected reserves which have additional uncertainty. In each case, management believes they have selected an appropriate best estimate based on current information and current analyses.\nLoss Reserving Sensitivity Analysis. The most significant key assumptions identified in the reserving process are that (i) the historic loss development and trend experience is assumed to be indicative of future loss development and trends, (ii) the information developed from internal and independent external sources can be used to develop meaningful estimates of the initial expected ultimate loss ratios, and (iii) no significant losses or types of losses will emerge that are not represented in either the initial expected loss ratios or the historical development patterns.\nWe believe that there is potentially significant risk in estimating loss reserves for long-tail lines of business and for immature accident years that may not be adequately captured through traditional actuarial projection methodologies. As discussed above, these methodologies usually rely heavily on projections of prior year trends into the future. In selecting our best estimate of future liabilities, we consider both the results of actuarial point estimates of loss reserves in addition to the stochastic distribution of reserves. In determining the appropriate best estimate, we review (i) the position of overall reserves within the actuarial distribution, (ii) the result of bottom up analysis by accident year reflecting the impact of parameter uncertainty in actuarial calculations, and (iii) specific qualitative information on events that may have an effect on future claims but which may not have been adequately reflected in actuarial best estimates, such as the potential for outstanding litigation or claims practices of cedants to have an adverse impact.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. Given the risks and uncertainties associated with the process for estimating reserves for losses and loss expenses, management has performed an evaluation of the potential variability in loss reserves and the impact this variability may have on reported results, financial condition and liquidity. Because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above, we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates, and we have generally experienced favorable net development on prior year reserves in the last several years. However, there is no assurance that this will occur in future periods.\nManagement's best estimate of the net reserve for losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2017 was $5,234.3 million. The following tables show the effect on estimated net reserves for losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2017 of a change in two of the most critical assumptions in establishing reserves: (i) loss emergence patterns, accelerated or decelerated by three and six months; and (ii) expected loss ratios varied by plus or minus five and ten percent. Management believes that these scenarios present a reasonable range of variability around the booked reserves using standard actuarial techniques. Loss reserves may vary beyond these scenarios in periods of heightened or reduced claim activity. The reserves resulting from the changes in the assumptions\nare not additive and should be considered separately. The following tables vary the assumptions employed therein independently. In addition, the tables below do not adjust any parameters other than the ones described above.\nNet reserve for losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2017 - Sensitivity to loss emergence patterns\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Reserve for losses and loss expenses\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Six month acceleration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,097.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three month acceleration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,160.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>No change (selected)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,234.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three month deceleration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,335.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Six month deceleration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,457.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet reserve for losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2017 - Sensitivity to expected loss ratios\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Reserve for losses and loss expenses\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10% favorable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,897.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5% favorable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,065.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>No change (selected)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,234.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5% unfavorable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,405.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10% unfavorable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,577.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe most significant variance in the above scenarios (i.e., a 10% deterioration in expected loss ratio) would have the effect of increasing losses and loss expenses by $343.0 million.\nManagement believes that the reserve for losses and loss expenses are sufficient to cover expected claims incurred before the reporting date on the basis of the methodologies and judgments used to support its estimates. However, there can be no assurance that actual payments will not vary significantly from total reserves. The reserve for losses and loss expenses and the methodology of estimating such reserve are regularly reviewed and updated as new information becomes known. Any resulting adjustments are reflected in income in the period in which they become known.\nResults of Operations\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Gross written premiums in our reinsurance segment increased by 9.6% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to growth in agriculture insurance business written within specialty reinsurance and due to $32.3 million of reinstatement premiums associated with catastrophe losses. Gross written premiums from our insurance segment increased by 4.5% due to growth in financial and professional lines insurance partially offset by reductions in marine, aviation and energy insurance where we continue to experience challenging market conditions and in property and casualty insurance as a result of a change in our appetite for this type of business.\nOverall gross written premiums in 2016 increased by 5.0% compared to 2015 due primarily to our specialty reinsurance and casualty reinsurance business lines. The increase in our specialty reinsurance business was largely due to growth in agriculture business written following our acquisition of AgriLogic in January 2016 (which was subsequently sold in December 2017) and growth in specialty marine business. The increase in casualty reinsurance lines of business was largely due to growth in our U.S. casualty treaty and international casualty business lines. Premiums from our insurance segments reduced slightly due to reductions in our property and casualty and marine, aviation and energy business lines offset by growth in financial and professional lines insurance.\nCeded written premiums.

Ceded written premiums increased in both segments in part due to the purchase of a whole account quota share contract. Ceded reinsurance premiums increased for our insurance segment due to the restructure of our ceded reinsurance arrangements though the use of significant quota share reinsurance arrangements and the recognition of ceded premiums to reinstate cover following catastrophe and other large losses. Ceded reinsurance premiums also increased for our reinsurance segment due to increased reinsurance for our property catastrophe and other property business lines due to new business opportunities which were written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession, an increase in ceded reinsurance premiums following the sale of AgriLogic in December 2017 and due to the recognition of additional ceded premiums as a result of reinstating cover following catastrophe losses. Due to these changes, the retention ratio, which is defined as net written premium as a percentage of gross written premium, decreased from 82.4% in 2016 to 65.8% in 2017.\nIn 2016, total ceded written premiums increased by $202.2 million compared to 2015. Ceded reinsurance costs increased for our reinsurance segment due to increased ceded reinsurance for our property catastrophe business line for new business opportunities written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession costs and due to our agriculture business reported in our specialty reinsurance business line. Ceded reinsurance costs increased for our insurance segment because we restructured our ceded reinsurance arrangements to reduce earnings volatility and benefit the expense ratio. In addition, we purchased an adverse development cover in the fourth quarter of 2016 for certain casualty business which we have ceased to underwrite. These changes led the retention ratio to decrease from 88.3% in 2015 to 82.4% in 2016.\nNet premiums earned.

Net premiums earned increased by $164.0 million, or 6.6%, in 2016 compared to 2015 due to growth in gross earned premium and the impact from and the increases in ceded written premiums in 2016 not substantially flowing into earnings until 2017.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses. The loss ratio for 2017 of 86.5% increased by 26.7 percentage points compared to 2016. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased from $1,576.1 million in 2016 to $1,994.7 million in 2017. The increase in the loss ratio was largely due to a $409.6 million increase in catastrophe losses, a $59.7 million increase in large losses, a $23.9 million decrease in prior year reserve releases and a decrease in net earned premiums, as above. In 2017, net losses from major catastrophes increased by $409.6 million to $576.0 million compared with $166.4 million in 2016. Large losses in 2017 included $64.0 million of fire-related losses, a $12.6 million surety loss, an $11.1 million loss related to cyber and terrorism and a $4.8 million loss from a refinery explosion.\nThe loss ratio for 2016 of 59.8% increased by 4.6 percentage points compared to 2015. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased from $1,366.2 million in 2015 to $1,576.1 million in 2016 due to an increase in large and catastrophe losses, changes in business mix towards lines which have higher non-catastrophe loss ratios and a reduction in reserve releases. In 2016, net losses from major catastrophes increased by $75.9 million to $166.4 million compared with $90.5 million in 2015. Large losses in 2016 included $32.7 million of energy-related losses, $11.8 million of fire-related losses and a $4.2 million aviation loss.\nIn the reinsurance segment, the loss ratio for 2017 was 92.6% compared to 55.7% in 2016 largely due to a $352.5 million increase in catastrophe losses, a $25.3 million increase in large losses and a $5.2 million decrease in reserve releases. In 2017, we experienced $467.3 million of catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, associated with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, wildfires in California, earthquakes in Mexico and other weather-related events in the U.S. and Australia. In the comparable period in 2016, we experienced $114.8 million of natural catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, associated with wildfires in Canada, earthquakes in Japan and Taiwan, Hurricane Matthew and other weather-related events in the U.S. and Europe.\nIn the insurance segment, the loss ratio for 2017 was 79.8% compared to 63.1% in 2016. The increase in the loss ratio was largely due to a $57.1 million increase in catastrophe losses, a $34.4 million increase in large losses, an increase in attritional losses, an $18.7 million decrease in reserve releases and a decrease in net earned premiums. In 2017, there were $108.7 million of catastrophe losses associated with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, wildfires in California and U.S. weather-related events. The loss ratio for 2016 was 63.1% compared to 62.4% for 2015. The increase in the loss ratio in 2016 was mainly due to a decrease of $23.4 million in prior year reserve releases and a $10.7 million increase in catastrophe losses. In 2016, our insurance segment experienced $51.6 million of catastrophe losses associated with U.S. weather-related events and Hurricane Matthew.\nOverall, prior year reserve releases decreased by $23.9 million from $129.3 million in 2016 to $105.4 million in 2017. The reinsurance segment had reserve releases of $81.8 million compared to $87.0 million in 2016. The reserve releases from the reinsurance segment were across all reinsurance business lines. The insurance segment had reserve releases of $23.6 million compared to $42.3 million in 2016. The reserve releases from the insurance segment were principally from marine, energy and aviation insurance.\nOverall, prior year reserve releases reduced by $27.2 million from $156.5 million in 2015 to $129.3 million in 2016. The reserve releases from reinsurance were across all business lines, totaling $87.0 million. The insurance segment had reserve releases of $42.3 million compared to $65.7 million in 2015. The reserve releases from insurance were from marine, energy and aviation insurance and financial and professional lines insurance.\nWe have presented loss ratios both including and excluding the impact from catastrophe losses to aid in the analysis of the underlying performance of our segments. We have defined major 2017 catastrophe losses as losses associated with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the earthquakes in Mexico, a tornado in Mississippi, Cyclone Debbie in Australia, wildfires in California and other U.S. weather-related events. We have defined major 2016 catastrophe losses as losses associated with wildfires in North America, Hurricane Matthew and other weather-related events in the U.S., several earthquakes and a hailstorm in the Netherlands. We have defined major 2015 catastrophe losses as losses associated with winter storms in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, storms in the U.S., U.S. wildfires, the Chilean earthquake, U.K. floods and weather-related events in the Philippines.\nThe underlying changes in loss ratios by segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are shown in the tables below. The total loss ratio represents the calendar year U.S. GAAP loss ratio. The current year adjustments represent catastrophe loss events incurred in those years which reflect net claims and reinstatement premium adjustments.\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Loss\nRatio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current Year\nAdjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loss\nRatio Excluding\nCurrent Year\nAdjustments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Loss\nRatio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current Year\nAdjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loss\nRatio Excluding\nCurrent Year\nAdjustments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Loss\nRatio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current Year\nAdjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loss\nRatio Excluding\nCurrent Year\nAdjustments\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExpenses.

</tr>\n</table>\n____________________\n(1) The total group general and administrative expense ratio includes corporate and non-operating expenses. Comparative ratios have been re-presented to include corporate and non-operating expenses.\nPolicy acquisition expenses decreased by $128.4 million in 2017 compared to 2016 as although gross policy acquisition expenses increased this was more than offset by an increase in over-rider commissions associated with the increase in ceded reinsurance. Policy acquisition expenses increased by $45.3 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to growth in written premiums and higher profit commission accruals.\nThe decrease in the policy acquisition expense ratio, gross of the effect of reinsurance, to 18.6% in 2017 from 18.9% in 2016 is due to a reduction in profit commission accruals in the insurance segment partially offset by an increase in the acquisition ratio in the reinsurance segment due to an increase in profit commission accruals and the prior year benefiting from FET refunds.\nThe reduction in the policy acquisition expense ratio, gross of the effect of reinsurance, to 18.9% in 2016 from 19.0% in 2015 was due to FET refunds and changes in business mix toward agriculture and specialty marine business lines which have lower average commission rates.\nGeneral, administrative and corporate expenses increased by $12.1 million from $490.1 million in 2016 to $502.2 million in 2017 due to $15.2 million of costs associated with the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program, and increased costs associated with growth in our insurance business, partially offset by lower provisions for performance-related remuneration. General, administrative and corporate expenses increased by $66.1 million from $424.0 million in 2015 to $490.1 million in 2016 due to costs associated with AgriLogic which we acquired in January 2016 and subsequently sold in December 2017, costs associated with growth in our insurance and reinsurance business and reorganization costs.\nInvestment gains. Total net realized and unrealized investment gains for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $120.5 million (2016 - losses of $45.2 million; 2015 - losses of $17.0 million).\nNet investment income. In 2017, we generated net investment income of $189.0 million, an increase of 1.0% on the prior year (2016 - $187.1 million, 2015 - $185.5 million). The increase was primarily due to the increase in the book yield of the fixed income portfolio despite a reduction in dividend income following the sale of a portion of our equity portfolio in the third quarter of 2017. The increase in investment income in 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to an increase in invested assets.\nForeign exchange contracts. We use foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risk. A foreign exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract. Foreign exchange contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time.\nAs at December 31, 2017, we held foreign exchange contracts that were not designated as hedging under ASC 815 - \"Derivatives and Hedging\" with a notional amount of $751.6 million (2016 - $665.6 million). The foreign exchange contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value in the balance sheet with changes recorded as a change in fair value of derivatives in the statement of operations. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign exchange contracts on net income was a gain of $27.7 million (December 31, 2016 - loss of $21.5 million).\nAs at December 31, 2017, we held foreign exchange contracts that were designated as hedging under ASC 815 with a notional amount of $60.6 million (2016 - $108.6 million). The foreign exchange contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value in the balance sheet with the effective portion recorded in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion recorded as a change in fair value of derivatives in the statement of operations. The contracts are considered to be effective and therefore the movement in other comprehensive income representing the effective portion was a gain of $3.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 - gain of $0.7 million).\nAs the foreign exchange contracts settle, the realized gain or loss is reclassified from other comprehensive income into general, administration and corporate expenses of the statement of operations and other comprehensive income. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the amount recognized within general, administration and corporate expenses for settled foreign exchange contracts was a realized gain of $4.4 million (December 31, 2016 - loss of $8.7 million recognized within general, administration and corporate expenses).\nInterest on long-term debt. Interest on long-term debt is the interest due on our senior notes.\nIncome before tax. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, loss before tax was $281.8 million (2016 - income of$209.5 million; 2015 - income of $337.5 million), consisting of the amounts set out in the table below:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Twelve Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underwriting (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(499.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>125.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>263.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of loan notes issued by variable interest entities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized investment gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized and unrealized investment (losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized and unrealized foreign exchange (losses) gains\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income before tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(281.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in underwriting income in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to higher catastrophe losses, lower reserve releases, an increase in large losses, an increase in attritional losses in the insurance segment and a reduction in premiums earned offset by a reduction in expenses. The decrease in underwriting income in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to higher catastrophe losses, lower reserve releases and an increase in expenses, partially offset by growth in premiums earned.\nThe increase in corporate and non-operating expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to $15.2 million of costs associated with implementing the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program and higher salary costs due to increased headcount as a result of growth in our insurance and reinsurance business, partially offset by reductions in performance-related remuneration provisions. The increase in corporate and non-operating expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to higher salary costs due to increased headcount as result of growth in our insurance and reinsurance business and reorganization costs.\nChange in fair value of derivatives. The change in fair value of derivatives in 2017 was attributable to foreign exchange contracts that had a gain of $27.7 million compared to a loss of $21.5 million in 2016 and a gain of $11.6 million in 2015. Interest rate swaps\nhad a realized loss of $3.1 million and $4.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. There was no gain or loss in 2017 because we terminated our interest rate swaps on May 6, 2016.\nThe $21.2 million change in fair value of loan notes issued by variable interest entities represents the proportion of profit or loss generated by Silverton attributable to third-party investors. The reduction in the value of the loan notes in 2017 is due to catastrophe losses assumed by Silverton. The increase in the value in 2016 and 2015 is due to premiums received by Silverton being greater than the losses assumed.\nIncome tax expense. There was an income tax credit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 of $15.4 million compared to an expense of $6.1 million and $14.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 on our loss before tax was 5.5% (2016 - 2.9%; 2015 - 4.3%) and is representative of the geographic spread of our business between taxable and non-taxable jurisdictions.\nNet income after tax. In 2017, we had net loss after tax of $266.4 million, equivalent to $5.22 basic loss per ordinary share adjusted for the $36.2 million preference share dividends, $8.0 million of preference share redemption costs and $1.3 million non-controlling interest. Fully diluted loss per ordinary share was $5.22 for 2017. In 2016, we had net income after tax of $203.4 million, equivalent to $2.67 basic earnings per ordinary share adjusted for the $41.8 million preference share dividends and $0.1 million non-controlling interest. Fully diluted earnings per ordinary share were $2.61 in 2016. In 2015, we had net income after tax of $323.1 million, equivalent to fully diluted earnings per ordinary share of $4.54. For a more detailed description of basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share, see Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements, Earnings per Ordinary Share.\u201d\nUnderwriting Results by Business Segment\nWe are organized into two business segments: reinsurance and insurance. The Company has determined its reportable segments, Aspen Insurance and Aspen Re, by taking into account the manner in which management makes operating decisions and assesses\noperating performance.\nManagement measures segment results on the basis of the combined ratio, which is obtained by dividing the sum of the losses and loss expenses, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and operating and administrative expenses by net premiums earned. Other than corporate expenses, indirect operating and administrative expenses are allocated to segments predominantly based on each segment's proportional share of gross earned premiums.\nNon-underwriting disclosures. We provide additional disclosures for corporate and other (non-underwriting) income and expenses. Corporate and other income and expenses include net investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains or losses, expenses associated with managing the Group, certain strategic and non-recurring costs, changes in fair value of derivatives and changes in fair value of loan notes issued by variable interest entities, interest expense, net realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses and income taxes, which are not allocated to the business segments. Corporate expenses are not allocated to our business segments as they typically do not fluctuate with the levels of premiums written and are not directly related to our segment operations.\nWe do not allocate our assets by segment as we evaluate underwriting results of each segment separately from the results of our investment portfolio. Segment profit or loss for each of our operating segments is measured by underwriting profit or loss. See Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements, Segment Reporting\u201d for information on gross and net premiums written and earned, underwriting results, and combined ratios and reserves for each of our business segments.\nReinsurance\nOur reinsurance segment consists of property catastrophe, other property reinsurance, casualty and specialty reinsurance. For a more detailed description of this segment, see Part I, Item 1, Business - Business Segments - Reinsurance\u201d and Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements, Segment Reporting.\u201d\nGross written premiums. The table below shows our gross written premiums for each line of business for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and the percentage change in gross written premiums for each line of business:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lines of Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property catastrophe reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>273.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other property reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>360.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Casualty reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>319.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>320.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>287.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specialty reinsurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>599.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>491.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>326.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,548.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,413.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,248.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in property catastrophe reinsurance gross written premiums was primarily due to $22.2 million of reinstatement premiums associated with catastrophe losses recognized in 2017 partially offset by premium reductions due to challenging market conditions and downward revisions on premium estimates. The increase in other property reinsurance gross written premiums was largely due to reductions in premium estimates for proportional contracts in the comparative period. Gross written premiums in casualty reinsurance decreased slightly due to reductions in U.S. casualty treaty business lines. The increase in gross written premiums in specialty reinsurance was predominantly due to growth in agriculture insurance business, as well as growth in engineering and cyber business lines.\nThe 13.2% increase in gross written premiums for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the equivalent period in 2015 was attributable to increased business written in our specialty reinsurance and casualty reinsurance business lines. The increase in our specialty reinsurance gross written premiums was mainly due to growth in agriculture business written following our acquisition of AgriLogic in January 2016. The increase in our casualty reinsurance gross written premiums was largely due to growth in our U.S. casualty treaty and international casualty business lines. The slight decrease in property catastrophe reinsurance gross written premiums was largely due to reductions in business written due to challenging market conditions, partially offset by new business opportunities which were written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession costs. The decrease in other property reinsurance gross written premiums was largely due to challenging market conditions and adjustments in prior year premium estimates on proportional contracts.\nCeded written premiums. Total ceded written premiums in 2017 was $298.5 million, an increase of $154.5 million compared to 2016. Ceded written premiums increased across all lines of business due to the purchase of a whole account quota share contract in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in ceded written premiums in property catastrophe and other property reinsurance was due to new business opportunities which were written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession. Ceded written premiums also increased in property catastrophe and other property reinsurance due to the recognition of ceded costs to reinstate cover following catastrophe losses. The increase in ceded written premiums in specialty reinsurance was due to an increase in retrocession costs following the sale of our agriculture business in December 2017. Total ceded written premiums in 2016 was $144.0 million, an increase of $48.6 million compared to $95.4 million in 2015. The largest increase in ceded written premiums in 2016 was in specialty reinsurance as a result of increased retrocession costs following the acquisition of AgriLogic in January 2016 and in property catastrophe reinsurance due to new business opportunities which were written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession costs.\nNet premiums earned. Net premiums earned increased by $24.2 million, or 2.0%, in 2017 compared to 2016 largely due to increased business written in specialty reinsurance and inwards reinstatement premiums associated with catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased ceded costs. Net premiums earned increased by $109.3 million, or 10.2%, in 2016 compared to 2015 largely due to increased business written in specialty reinsurance and casualty reinsurance, partially offset by increased ceded costs in specialty reinsurance and property catastrophe reinsurance lines.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses. The loss ratio in 2017 of 92.6% increased by 36.9 percentage points compared to 55.7% in 2016. The increase in the loss ratio was mainly due to a $352.5 million increase in catastrophe losses. The increase in the loss ratio was compounded by a $5.2 million decrease in prior year reserve releases compared to 2016 and $25.3 million of large fire related losses, the largest of which was a fire in a chemical plant, compared with no large losses in 2016. In 2017, our reinsurance segment experienced $467.3 million of catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, including $72.1 million from Hurricane Harvey, $119.6 million from Hurricane Irma, $57.1 million from Hurricane Maria, $16.6 million from the earthquakes in Mexico, $7.2 million from a tornado in Mississippi, $5.7 million from Cyclone Debbie in Australia, $125.8 million from the wildfires in California and $32.9 million from U.S. weather-related events.\nThe loss ratio in 2016 of 55.7% increased compared to 45.8% in 2015 mainly due to an increase in catastrophe losses of $65.2 million, changes in business mix towards lines which have higher non-catastrophe ratios and a $3.8 million decrease in prior year reserve releases. In 2016, our reinsurance segment experienced $114.8 million of catastrophe losses, including $35.4 million from the wildfires in Canada, $10.5 million from an earthquake in New Zealand, $9.3 million from Hurricane Matthew, $8.5 million from an earthquake in Japan, $9.2 million from U.S wildfires, $5.0 million from a hailstorm in the Netherlands, $2.3 million from an earthquake in Taiwan and $31.2 million from U.S. weather-related events.\nThe $5.2 million reduction in prior year reserve releases from $87.0 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 to $81.8 million in the current period included a $13.1 million reinsurance recovery in respect of an offshore energy-related loss that occurred in Africa and adverse development of $12.8 million in casualty reinsurance due to the U.K. Ministry of Justice decision to increase the discount rate used to calculate lump sum awards in U.K. bodily injury cases, known as the Ogden rate. The $3.8 million decrease in prior year reserve releases from $90.8 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to $87.0 million in 2016 was due predominantly to a decrease in reserve releases from casualty lines. Prior year reserve releases are further discussed below under Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.\u201d\nPolicy acquisition, general and administrative expenses. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs were $235.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, equivalent to 19.5% of net premiums earned (2016 - $226.4 million or 19.2% of net premiums earned; 2015 - $224.7 million or 20.9% of net premiums earned). The increase in the acquisition ratio is due to an increase in profit commission accruals and the prior period benefiting from FET refunds. The decrease in policy acquisition expense ratio in 2016 compared with 2015 was due to FET refunds and changes in business mix towards agriculture and specialty marine business lines, which have lower average commission rates, and away from other property, casualty and specialty business written on a pro rata basis which have higher average commission rates.\nOur general and administrative expenses decreased by $20.9 million from $178.2 million in 2016 to $157.3 million in 2017. Our general and administrative expense ratio was 13.0% in 2017 compared to 15.1% in 2016 due to a lower provision for performance-related remuneration. Our general and administrative expense ratio of 15.1% in 2016 increased from 13.7% in 2015 due predominantly to costs associated with AgriLogic.\nInsurance\nOur insurance segment consists of property and casualty insurance, marine, aviation and energy insurance, and financial and professional lines insurance.

The decrease in gross written premiums in marine, aviation and energy insurance was largely attributable to continued challenging market conditions in marine and energy liability and aviation business lines. The increase in gross written premiums in financial and professional lines insurance was largely attributable to growth in our management liability, surety, cyber and accident and health business lines.\nThe decrease in gross written premiums in 2016 compared to 2015 in property and casualty insurance was largely attributable to reductions in our global casualty, U.S. casualty and U.S. environmental business lines, partially offset by growth in our U.S. excess casualty and railroad insurance business lines. The decrease in gross written premiums in marine, aviation and energy insurance was largely due to challenging market conditions in our marine and energy liability, U.S. inland marine, offshore energy, and energy and construction insurance business lines, partially offset by growth in our ocean cargo and aviation insurance business lines. The increase in gross written premiums in financial and professional lines insurance was largely attributable to growth in our accident and health, credit and political risks, management liability and financial institutions business lines.\nCeded written premiums. Total ceded written premiums for 2017 was $849.9 million, an increase of $440.6 million from 2016. Ceded written premiums increased as a result of the impact from restructuring our ceded reinsurance arrangements in the second half of 2016 and in particular through the use of significant quota share reinsurance arrangement which aim to reduce earnings volatility and benefit the expense ratio through an increase in over-rider commissions. Ceded written premiums also increased across all lines of business due to the purchase of a whole account quota share contract and due to the recognition of ceded costs to reinstate cover following catastrophe losses.\nCeded reinsurance for 2016 was $409.3 million, an increase of $153.6 million from 2015. Ceded reinsurance increased across all our business lines because we restructured our ceded reinsurance arrangements to seek to reduce volatility and benefit the expense ratio. In addition, we purchased an adverse development cover in the fourth quarter of 2016 for certain casualty business which we ceased to underwrite.\nNet premiums earned. Net premiums earned decreased by $354.9 million, or 24.4%, in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the impact from the increase in ceded written premiums. Net premiums earned increased by $54.7 million, or 3.9%, in 2016 compared to 2015 due to written premium growth in 2016 and the impact from the increases in ceded written premiums in 2016 not flowing into earnings until 2017.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses. The loss ratio in 2017 was 79.8% compared to 63.1% in 2016. The increase in the loss ratio in 2017 was primarily due a $57.1 million increase in catastrophe losses, an $18.7 million decrease in prior year reserve releases, a $34.4 million increase in large losses, an increase in attritional losses in U.S. property, primary casualty and management liability classes and a decrease in net earned premiums. The loss ratio in 2016 increased from 62.4% in 2015 due primarily to a $23.4 million reduction in prior year reserve releases and a $10.7 million increase in catastrophe losses.\nIn 2017, the insurance segment experienced $108.7 million of catastrophe losses, consisting of $22.4 million from Hurricane Harvey, $20.6 million from Hurricane Irma, $13.2 million from Hurricane Maria, $10.2 million from wildfires in California, and $42.3 million from U.S. weather-related events. Large losses experienced during 2017 included $38.7 million of fire-related losses, a $12.6 million surety loss, an $11.1 million loss related to cyber and terrorism and a $4.8 million refinery explosion.\nIn 2016, the insurance segment experienced $51.6 million of catastrophe losses, consisting of $39.9 million associated with U.S. weather-related events and $11.7 million from Hurricane Matthew. Large losses experienced during 2016 included $32.7 million of energy-related losses, $11.8 million of fire-related losses and a $4.2 million aviation loss.\nIn 2015, the insurance segment experienced $40.9 million of catastrophe losses, consisting of $25.7 million associated with U.K. floods and $15.2 million associated with U.S. storms. Large losses included $37.6 million of energy losses, $10.0 million associated with a dam collapse in Brazil and $3.0 million associated with the port explosion in Tianjin, China.\nIn 2017, there were reserve releases of $23.6 million compared to $42.3 million of reserve releases in 2016. The reserve releases were principally from our marine, aviation and energy business lines which included an additional $15.4 million reinsurance recovery in respect of an offshore energy-related loss that occurred in Africa which offset adverse development in property and casualty insurance and financial and professional lines insurance. The reserve releases in 2016 were predominantly from marine, energy and aviation insurance and financial and professional lines insurance offsetting adverse development in our property and casualty insurance. Prior year reserve releases are further discussed under Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.\u201d\nPolicy acquisition, general and administrative expenses. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs were $165.0 million in 2017, equivalent to 15.0% of net premiums earned (2016 - $302.5 million or 20.8% of net premiums earned; 2015 - $258.9 million or 18.5% of net earned premium). The decrease in the acquisition expense ratio in 2017 compared with 2016 was due to lower profit commission accruals and an increase in over-rider commissions. The increase in the acquisition expense ratio in 2016 compared with 2015 was due to higher profit commission accruals and lower ceding commissions.\nOur general and administrative expenses increased by $25.5 million to $253.9 million in 2017 from $228.4 million in 2016. Our general and administrative expense ratio was 23.1% in 2017 compared to 15.7% in 2016 due predominantly to costs associated with growth in the business. General and administrative expenses of $228.4 million in 2016 increased from $213.6 million in 2015 largely due to costs associated with growth in the business.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal cash and investments\nAs at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, total cash and investments, including accrued interest receivable, were $8.7 billion and $9.2 billion, respectively. Total cash and investments decreased mainly as a result of increased payments associated with the increase in ceded written premiums and due to increased claims payments during 2017. Our investment strategy is focused on delivering stable investment income and total return through all market cycles while maintaining appropriate portfolio liquidity and credit quality to meet the requirements of our customers, rating agencies and regulators.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our investments consisted of a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities including U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt, global equities and money market funds. Our overall portfolio strategy remains focused on high quality fixed income investments. In the third quarter of 2017, we took advantage of rising equity markets and sold $208.1 million of our equity portfolio. Proceeds from the sales were reinvested into a core fixed income strategy. As at December 31, 2017, we had a 5.8% (2016 -6.8%) position in equities, a 4.0% (2016 - 3.8%) position in U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt and 0.2% (2016 -0.2%) in risk asset portfolio cash. As at December 31, 2017, approximately 10% of our total cash and investments, excluding catastrophe bonds and funds held by variable interest entities (the Managed Portfolio\u201d), was invested in equities and U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt (2016 - 10.8%).\nBook yield for the year ended December 31, 2017 on the fixed income portfolio was 2.56%, an increase of 7.0 basis points from 2.49% at December 31, 2016, as a result of rising interest rates. Our fixed income portfolio duration as at December 31, 2017 was 3.90 years compared to 3.89 as at December 31, 2016. As at December 31, 2017, the average credit quality of our fixed income portfolio was AA-,\u201d with 88.9% of the portfolio being rated A\u201d or higher. As at December 31, 2016, the average credit quality of our fixed income portfolio was AA-,\u201d with 89.3% of the portfolio being rated A\u201d or higher. Where the credit ratings were split between the two main rating agencies, S&P and Moody's, the lowest rating was used.\nUnrealized gains in the available for sale investment portfolio, net of taxes and including equity securities, were $9.7 million as at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $12.8 million from December 31, 2016.\nAs at December 31, 2017, we had investments in four entities classified as other investments, equity method: a micro-insurance incubator ( MVI\u201d), Bene Assicurazioni ( Bene\u201d), Digital Risk Resources, LLC ( Digital Re\u201d) and Crop Re Services LLC ( Crop Re\u201d).

The estimated cost of claims includes expenses to be incurred in settling claims and a deduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries. Estimated amounts recoverable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are calculated to arrive at a net claims reserve.\nReserves by segment.

Of the total gross reserves for unpaid losses of $6,749.5 million at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2017, a total of $3,720.8 million, or 55.1%, represented IBNR claims (December 31, 2016 - $3,044.9 million and 57.2%, respectively).

The specialty reinsurance business lines reported favorable development and the recognition of additional prior year ceded recoveries in respect of an offshore energy-related loss that occurred in Africa. The casualty reinsurance business line reported a net reserve release due to favorable development despite our exposure to the Ogden rate change from reinsurance of U.K. employer's liability and U.K. public liability business and, to a lesser degree, U.K. motor liability reinsurance.\nInsurance. Net reserve releases of $23.6 million in 2017 were mainly as a result of favorable development and the recognition of additional prior year ceded recoveries in our marine, aviation and energy business line in respect of an offshore energy-related loss that occurred in Africa. Net reserves were strengthened in property and casualty lines due to adverse development in our casualty lines following the change in the Ogden rate which impacted our U.K. employer's liability and U.K. public liability business and increases in loss reserves associated with the purchase of an adverse development cover. Financial and professional lines reported an increase in prior year reserves due to adverse development in the management liability account.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The analysis of the development by each segment is as follows:\nReinsurance. Net reserve releases of $87.0 million in 2016 were attributable to all lines of business. The largest releases in the period were $39.7 million from other property reinsurance lines, $18.9 million from specialty reinsurance lines and $14.9 million from casualty reinsurance lines due to better than expected claims development.\nInsurance. Net reserve releases of $42.3 million in 2017 were attributable to net reserve releases of $38.9 million from marine, aviation and energy lines and $15.3 million from financial and professional lines due to better than expected development partially offset by an $11.9 million net reserve strengthening in property and casualty lines.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The analysis of the development by each segment is as follows:\nReinsurance. Net reserve releases of $90.8 million in 2015 were attributable to all lines of business. The largest releases in the period were $32.6 million from specialty reinsurance lines due primarily to benign incurred experience and $25.5 million from casualty reinsurance and $24.8 million from other property reinsurance lines due to favorable development.\nInsurance. Net reserve releases of $65.7 million in 2015 were largely attributable to net reserve releases of $53.7 million from property and casualty lines and $8.8 million from financial and professional lines. The most significant factor affecting the level of release in 2015 was the release of a small number of case reserves where we saw favorable claims development.\nOther than the matters described under - Critical Accounting Policies - Reserving Approach,\u201d we did not make any significant changes in methodologies used in our reserving process.\nCapital Management\nThe following table shows our capital structures as at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As at December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share capital, additional paid-in capital, retained income and accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to ordinary shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,416.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,851.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preference shares (liquidation preferences net of issue costs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>511.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>797.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>549.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>549.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan Notes issued by Silverton (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>223.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,564.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,421.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\n (1) We do not consider the Loan Notes issued by Silverton to be part of our permanent capital as the noteholders have no recourse to the other assets of the Company.  As at December 31, 2017, total shareholders' equity was $2,928.5 million compared to $3,648.3 million as at December 31, 2016. Our total shareholders' equity as at December 31, 2017 includes two classes of preference shares with a total value as measured by their respective liquidation preferences of $511.9 million net of share issuance costs (December 31, 2016 - $797.1 million, four classes of preference shares).\nOur preference shares are classified in our balance sheet as equity but may receive a different treatment in some cases under the capital adequacy assessments made by certain rating agencies. Such securities are often referred to as hybrids\u201d as they have certain attributes of both debt and equity. We also monitor the ratio of the total of debt and hybrids to total capital which was 30.5% as of December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 - 32.1%).\nOur senior notes were the only material debt issued by Aspen Holdings as at December 31, 2017 and 2016 of $549.5 million and $549.3 million, respectively.\nIn addition to the senior notes issued by Aspen Holdings, we have also reported $86.6 million of debt issued by Silverton. For further information relating to Silverton, refer to Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements, Variable Interest Entities.\u201d\nWe monitor the ratio of the total of debt and hybrids to total capital, with total capital being defined as shareholders' equity plus outstanding debt and excluding loan notes issued by variable interest entities, which was 15.8% as at December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 - 13.1%).\nThe principal capital management transactions during 2017 were as follows:\n \u2022 On January 3, 2017, we elected to redeem all of the outstanding 7.401% Preference Shares. Each holder of a 7.401% Preference Share received $25 per 7.401% Preference Share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends. \n \u2022 On February 8, 2017, we replaced our existing share repurchase authorization with a new authorization of $250.0 million. The share repurchase authorization, which is effective through February 8, 2019, permits us to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of transactions, including open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions and accelerated share repurchase transactions. \n \u2022 On April 26, 2017, we announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to our ordinary shareholders from $0.22 per ordinary share to $0.24 per ordinary share. \n \u2022 On July 3, 2017, we elected to redeem all of the outstanding 7.250% Preference Shares. Each holder of a 7.250% Preference Share received $25 per 7.250% Preference Share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends. \n \u2022 For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 648,941 ordinary shares in open market repurchases for a total consideration of $30.0 million at an average price of $46.23 per ordinary share. As at December 31, 2017, we had $220.0 million remaining under our $250.0 million share repurchase authorization program.  The principal capital management transactions during 2016 were as follows:\n \u2022 On April 21, 2016, we announced a 5.0% increase in our quarterly dividend to our ordinary shareholders from $0.21 per ordinary share to $0.22 per ordinary share. \n \u2022 On September 20, 2016, we issued the 5.625% Preference Shares for total net proceeds of $241.3 million, consisting of $250.0 million of total liquidation preference less $8.7 million of issue expenses. The 5.625% Preference Shares have no stated maturity but are callable at our option on or after the 10 year anniversary of the date of issuance. \n \u2022 For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we acquired and canceled a total of 1,595,076 ordinary shares in open market repurchases. We paid a total consideration of $75.0 million and an average price of $47.02 per ordinary share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. As at December 31, 2016, we had $341.3 million remaining under our then existing $500.0 million share repurchase authorization program.  Access to capital. Our business operations are in part dependent on our financial strength, the opinions of the independent rating agencies thereof as discussed elsewhere in this report and the market's perception thereof, as measured by total shareholders' equity, which was $2,928.5 million as at December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 - $3,648.3 million). We believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds through debt or equity financing. Our continuing ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other things, our operating results, market conditions and our perceived financial strength. See Risk Factors - We may repurchase additional capital in the future, which may not be available of may only be available on unfavourable terms.\u201d We regularly monitor our capital and financial position, as well as investment and securities market conditions, both in general and with respect to Aspen Holdings' securities. Our ordinary shares and all our preference shares are listed on the NYSE.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short-term and long-term cash requirements of its business operations. Management monitors the liquidity of Aspen Holdings and of each of its Operating Subsidiaries and arranges credit facilities to enhance short-term liquidity resources on a stand-by basis. As a holding company, Aspen Holdings relies on dividends and other distributions from its Operating Subsidiaries to provide cash flow to meet ongoing cash requirements, including any future debt service payments and other expenses, and to pay dividends, if any, to our preference and ordinary shareholders.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, Aspen Holdings received dividends of $360.0 million (2016 - $234.5 million) from Aspen Bermuda and $13.6 million (2016 - $63.4 million) from Aspen European. In addition, Aspen Holdings received $18.7 million in respect of an intercompany loan from Aspen European (2016 - $21.6 million).\nAs at December 31, 2017, Aspen Holdings held $111.4 million (December 31, 2016 - $327.1 million) of cash, cash equivalents and investments with the reduction largely due to the costs associated with the redemption of the 7.401% Preference Shares on January 3, 2017 and the redemption of the 7.250% Preference Shares on July 3, 2017. Management considers the current cash and cash equivalents, together with dividends declared or expected to be declared by subsidiary companies and our credit facilities, sufficient to appropriately satisfy the liquidity requirements of Aspen Holdings. Aspen Holdings' liquidity depends on dividends, capital distributions and interest payments from our Operating Subsidiaries. Aspen Holdings has recourse to the credit facility described below.\nThe ability of our Operating Subsidiaries to pay us dividends or other distributions is subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the Operating Subsidiaries' need to maintain capital requirements adequate to maintain their insurance and reinsurance operations and their financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies. In line with common market practice for regulated institutions, the PRA previously requested that it be afforded with the opportunity to provide a non-objection\u201d prior to all future dividend payments made by Aspen U.K. In 2017, the PRA stated that they no longer routinely require Aspen U.K. to apply for a non-objection to dividends provided that such dividend payment and Aspen U.K.'s subsequent capital position are within Aspen U.K.'s board-approved solvency capital risk appetite. We do not expect to suffer tax on foreign earnings since our significant source of earnings outside of Bermuda is the U.K. and no taxes are imposed on profits repatriated from the U.K. to Bermuda. For a further discussion of the various restrictions on our ability and our Operating Subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, see Part I, Item 1 Business - Regulatory Matters.\u201d For a discussion of the volatility and liquidity of our other investments, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Market and Liquidity Risks,\u201d and for a discussion of the impact of insurance losses on our liquidity, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Insurance Risks\u201d and Note 15 of our consolidated financial statements, Statutory Requirements and Dividend Restrictions.\u201d\nOperating Subsidiaries. As at December 31, 2017, the Operating Subsidiaries held $821.7 million (December 31, 2016 - $1,409.3 million) in cash and short-term investments that are readily realizable securities. The reduction is largely due to the costs associated with the increase in ceded reinsurance and the significant level of claims activity in 2017. Management monitors the value, currency and duration of cash and investments held by its Operating Subsidiaries to ensure they are able to meet their insurance and other liabilities as they become due and, despite the year-on-year decrease, was satisfied that there was a comfortable margin of liquidity as at December 31, 2017 and for the foreseeable future.\nOn an ongoing basis, our Operating Subsidiaries' sources of funds primarily consist of premiums written, investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments. Cash is used primarily to pay reinsurance premiums, losses and loss adjustment expenses, brokerage commissions, general and administrative expenses, taxes, interest and dividends and to purchase new investments. The potential for individual large claims and for accumulations of claims from single events means that substantial and unpredictable payments may need to be made within relatively short periods of time.\nFor all material currencies in which our underwriting activities are written we ensure that sufficient cash and short-term investments are held in such currencies to enable us to meet potential claims without liquidating long-term investments and adversely affecting our investment return. This follows the matching principle which matches our assets and liabilities in currency to mitigate foreign currency risk whenever possible.\nWe manage these risks by making regular forecasts of the timing and amount of expected cash outflows and ensuring that we maintain sufficient balances in cash and short-term investments to meet these estimates. Notwithstanding this policy, if these cash flow forecasts are incorrect, we could be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity, potentially at a significant loss. Historically, we have not had to liquidate investments at a significant loss to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity.\nWhere we incur losses in currencies which are not normally held we will convert funds into the appropriate currencies to mitigate our currency risk and also make funds available to settle claims in local currencies as and when they become due. Recent examples of this have been where we have converted funds to Mexican Peso, Chilean Peso and Chinese Yuan to cover earthquake and other losses in these countries. For local regulatory reasons, we hold assets in trusts which limits our liquidity to some degree. The process of matching assets with liabilities in currency means, however, that at any one time we will hold cash and short-term assets in all major currencies which are available to settle claims.\nThe liquidity of our Operating Subsidiaries is also affected by the terms of our contractual obligations to policyholders and by undertakings to certain regulatory authorities to facilitate the issue of letters of credit or maintain certain balances in trust funds for the benefit of policyholders. The following table shows the forms of collateral or other security provided in respect of these obligations and undertakings as at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As at December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory trusts and deposits:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Affiliated transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,455.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,482.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third party\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,425.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,380.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit / guarantees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>658.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>672.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment commitment - real estate fund\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total restricted assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,638.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,535.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total as percent of investable assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 19(a), Commitments and Contingencies - Restricted Assets\u201d of our consolidated financial statements for further detail on our trust fund balances which we are required to maintain in accordance with contractual obligations to policyholders and in compliance with regulatory requirements.\nConsolidated cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Total net cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $(111.5) million, a decrease of $564.7 million from the equivalent period in 2016. The negative cash flows from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were due to the significant increase in ceded reinsurance costs and claims activity in 2017. We paid net claims of $1,555.1 million in 2017 and generated cash inflows of $419.0 million from investing and net purchases and sales of equipment during the period. We paid ordinary share and preference share dividends of $92.4 million, and $30.0 million was used to repurchase ordinary shares. At December 31, 2017, we had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of $1,054.8 million.\nConsolidated cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Total net cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $453.2 million, a decrease of $121.0 million from the equivalent period in 2015. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, our cash flows from operations provided us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We paid net claims of $1,222.8 million in 2016, and used $350.9 million in investing and net purchases and sales of equipment during the period. We paid ordinary and preference share dividends of $94.5 million, and $75.0 million was used to repurchase ordinary shares. At December 31, 2016, we had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of $1,273.8 million.\nConsolidated cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Total net cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was $574.2 million, a decrease of $33.2 million from the equivalent period in 2014. For the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2015, our cash flows from operations provided us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We paid net claims of $1,108.5 million in 2015, and used $501.9 million in investing and net purchases and sales of equipment during the period. We paid ordinary and preference share dividends of $88.7 million, and $83.7 million was used to repurchase ordinary shares. At December 31, 2015, we had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of $1,099.5 million.\nLetter of Credit Facilities.

By the nature of the insurance and reinsurance contracts under which these liabilities are assumed, there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods shown and there could be a material acceleration or deceleration of claims payments depending on factors outside our control. The total amount of payments in respect of our reserves, as well as the timing of such payments, may differ materially from our current estimates for the reasons set out under - Critical Accounting Policies - Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses\u201d above.  For a detailed description of our operating lease obligations, see Part I, Item 2, Properties.\u201d\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs at December 31, 2017, we were not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K, to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that we believe is material to investors.\nIn November 2016, Peregrine, a subsidiary of the Company, was registered as a segregated accounts company under the Bermuda Segregated Accounts Companies Act 2000, as amended. As at December 31, 2017, Peregrine had formed four segregated accounts which were funded by a third party investor. The segregated accounts have not been consolidated as part of the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations by its effect on interest rates and on the cost of settling claims. The potential exists after a catastrophe or other large property loss, such as the hurricanes in 2017, for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy as the demand for services, such as construction, typically surges. The cost of settling claims may also be increased by global commodity price inflation. We seek to take both these factors into account when setting reserves for any events where we think they may be material.\nOur calculation of reserves for losses and loss expenses in respect of casualty business includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims-handling expenses, such as medical treatments and litigation costs. We write casualty\nbusiness in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia and certain other territories, where claims inflation has in many years run at higher rates than general inflation. To the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims, we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in earnings. The actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled.\nIn addition to general price inflation, we are exposed to a persisting long-term upwards trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages. We seek to take this into account in our pricing and reserving of casualty business.\nWe also seek to take into account the projected impact of inflation on the likely actions of central banks in the setting of short-term interest rates and consequent effects on the yields and prices of fixed interest securities. As at February 2018, although inflation is currently low, we consider that in the medium-term there is a risk that inflation, interest rates and bond yields may rise, resulting in a decrease in the market value of certain of our fixed interest investments. See Risk Factors - Our results of operations and investment portfolio may be materially affected by conditions impacting the level of interest rates in the global capital markets and major economies, such as central bank policies in interest rates and the rate of inflation.\u201d\nReconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted diluted book value per ordinary share, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, is calculated by deducting from total shareholders' equity the total of: accumulated other comprehensive income; the value of preference shares less issue expenses; the share of equity due to non-controlling interests; and adding back ordinary dividends. The resulting balance is then divided by the diluted number of ordinary shares as at the year end. We believe that adding back ordinary dividends provides a more consistent and useful measurement of total shareholder value, which supplements U.S. GAAP information. We have excluded accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments is primarily the result of interest rate movements and the resultant impact on fixed income securities, and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign exchange is the result of exchange rate movements between the U.S. Dollar and the functional currencies of our Operating Subsidiaries. Therefore, we believe that excluding these unrealized appreciations (depreciations) provides a more consistent and useful measurement of operating performance, which supplements U.S. GAAP information.\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As at December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As at December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions, except for share amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,928.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,648.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preference shares less issue expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(511.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(797.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-controlling interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ordinary dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted total shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,526.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,907.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ordinary shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,474,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,774,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted ordinary shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,202,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,001,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Book Value Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage equity, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, is used in calculating ordinary shareholders return on average equity.

We exclude after-tax net realized and unrealized capital gains or losses, after-tax net foreign exchange gains or losses and changes in the fair value of derivatives from our calculation of operating income because the amount of these gains or losses is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part, according to the availability of market opportunities. We believe these amounts are largely independent of our business and underwriting process and including them distorts the analysis of trends in its operations. In addition to presenting net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe that showing operating income enables investors, analysts, rating agencies and other users of our financial information to more easily analyze our results of operations in a manner similar to how management analyzes our underlying business performance. Operating income should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income.\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As at December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As at December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>($ in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income after tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(266.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>203.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add (deduct) after tax income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized and unrealized investment (gains)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(115.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized and unrealized exchange (gains)/losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes to the fair value of derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization and other non-recurring expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proportion due to non-controlling interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating (loss)/income after tax and non-controlling interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(357.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preference Shares dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(41.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating (loss)/income available to ordinary shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(393.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related Notes contained in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and particularly under the headings Risk Factors,\u201d Business\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d contained in Item 1A, Item 1, and Part I of this report, respectively.\nAspen's Year in Review\nThe insurance and reinsurance industry continued to be challenged in 2017 as a result of the impact of a series of costly catastrophe events and losses. In addition, although rates generally increased following the catastrophes in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, the industry has experienced years of rate reductions across many lines of business in both insurance and reinsurance.\nBusiness Portfolio Optimization. In 2017, we launched a comprehensive program to enhance operating effectiveness and efficiency across our organization and enhance our market position (the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program\u201d). The Effectiveness and Efficiency Program is intended to allow us to be a more nimble organization with faster decision-making ability and a more competitive expense ratio.\nWe expect the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program to deliver cumulative total expense savings of approximately $160 million over the next three years. We expect to achieve approximately $30 million of the savings in 2018, $55 million in 2019 and $75 million in 2020, after which run-rate savings are expected to be approximately $80 million per year. We expect approximately 70% of the total expected savings to benefit our Insurance segment. We likewise expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $95 million to implement the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program and achieve the expected savings, the majority of which we expect will be incurred in 2018 and 2019. Approximately $50 million of this charge is for employee severance, benefits and related expenses, $30 million for business transformation and Effectiveness and Efficiency Program costs, and $15 million for outsourcing and premises. We also expect to spend a total of approximately $55 million in incremental capital expenditure, primarily information technology, in 2018 and 2019 that we expect to be amortized over a period of three to five years from the start of 2020. In 2017, we have recognized $15.2 million of expense associated with the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program.\nIn our insurance segment, we experienced a significant underwriting loss due to a combination of catastrophe losses and an increased incidence of large losses and attritional losses. Gross written premium for the insurance segment was $1.81 billion in 2017, an increase of 4.5% from 2016. Our combined ratio in insurance was 117.9% in 2017 compared to 99.6% in 2016.\nIn our reinsurance segment, our results were dominated by the significant level of natural catastrophe losses primarily in the U.S. Gross written premium for the reinsurance segment for 2017 was $1.55 billion, an increase of 9.6% from 2016, with growth primarily in specialty lines. The combined ratio was 125.1% in 2017 compared to 90.0% in 2016.\nOn December 18, 2017, the Company acquired through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Aspen U.S. Holdings, a 23.2% share of Crop Re Services LLC ( Crop Re\u201d), a newly formed U.S.-based subsidiary of CGB Diversified Services, Inc ( CGB DS\u201d) in exchange for the sale of AG Logic Holdings, LLC and its affiliates ( AgriLogic\u201d), the Company's U.S. crop insurance business. For further information regarding this transaction, see Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements, Investments.\u201d\nTotal ceded written premiums in 2017 increased by $595.1 million compared to 2016. Ceded written premiums increased in both our insurance and reinsurance segments due to the purchase of a whole account quota share contract. Ceded reinsurance premiums increased for our insurance segment due to the restructure of our ceded reinsurance arrangements through the use of significant quota share reinsurance arrangements and the recognition of ceded premiums to reinstate cover following catastrophe and other large losses. Ceded premiums also increased in the reinsurance segment due to increased gross written premiums written in conjunction with increased retrocession to third parties, an increase in ceded reinsurance premiums following the sale of AgriLogic in December 2017 and due to the recognition of additional ceded premiums as a result of reinstating cover following catastrophe losses.\nCapital Management. We continue to focus on capital management and maintain our capital at an appropriate level. In 2017, we repurchased 648,941 ordinary shares for a total consideration of $30.0 million. In addition, in the second quarter of 2017, we increased our quarterly dividend on our ordinary shares from $0.22 to $0.24 per ordinary share. On February 8, 2017, our Board of Directors also authorized a new share repurchase program of $250.0 million. The share repurchase authorization, which is effective through February 8, 2019, permits us to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of transactions.\nOn January 3, 2017, we also elected to redeem all of the outstanding 7.401% Preference Shares. Each holder of a 7.401% Preference Share received $25 per 7.401% Preference Share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends. We likewise elected to redeem all of the outstanding 7.250% Preference Shares on July 3, 2017. Each holder of a 7.250% Preference Share received $25 per 7.250% Preference Share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends.\nInvestment Management. We follow an investment strategy designed to emphasize the preservation of capital and provide sufficient liquidity for the prompt payment of claims. As of December 31, 2017, our investments consisted of a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities including U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt, global equities and money market funds. Our overall portfolio strategy remains focused on high quality fixed income investments. In the third quarter of 2017, we took advantage of rising equity markets and sold $208.1 million of our equity portfolio. Proceeds from the sales were reinvested into a core fixed income strategy. As at December 31, 2017, we had a 5.8% (2016 -6.8%) position in equities, a 4% (2016 - 3.8%) position in U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt and 0.2% (2016 -0.2%) in risk asset portfolio cash. As at December 31, 2017, approximately 10% of our total cash and investments, excluding catastrophe bonds and funds held by variable interest entities (the Managed Portfolio\u201d), was invested in equities and U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt (2016 - 10.8%).\nFinancial Overview\nThe following overview of our 2017, 2016 and 2015 operating results and financial condition is intended to identify important themes and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion further below.\nOperating highlights\n \u2022 Gross written premiums of $3,360.9 million in 2017, an increase of 6.8% from 2016. \n \u2022 Combined ratio of 125.7% for 2017, including $561.9 million, or 24.6 percentage points of pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatements, compared with 98.5% for 2016, which included $164.4 million or 6.3 percentage points of pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatements, and 91.9% for 2015, which included $90.5 million or 3.7 percentage points of pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatements. \n \u2022 Net favorable development on prior year loss reserves of $105.4 million, or 4.6 combined ratio points, for 2017 compared with $129.3 million, or 4.9 combined ratio points, for 2016, and $156.5 million, or 6.3 combined ratio points, for 2015. \n \u2022 Annualized net return on average equity of an 11.1% loss for 2017 compared with a 5.4% gain in 2016 and a 10.0% gain in 2015.  Gross written premiums. The changes in our segments' gross written premiums for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\nIn 2017, gross written premiums in our reinsurance segment increased by 9.6% compared to 2016 due primarily to growth in specialty reinsurance business lines. The 4.5% increase in gross written premiums in our insurance segment in 2017 was due to growth in financial and professional lines insurance. Overall gross written premiums in 2017 increased by 6.8%. In 2016 gross written premiums increased by 5.0% compared to 2015 due primarily to growth in specialty reinsurance and casualty reinsurance business lines.\nCeded written premiums. Ceded written premiums in 2017 increased by 107.6% compared to 2016. The changes in our segments' ceded written premiums for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\nCeded written premiums increased in both segments due to the combination of the purchase of a whole account quota share contract in the first quarter of 2017 in addition to increased use of quota share reinsurance, particularly in the insurance segment. Ceded written premiums increased in our insurance segment due to the restructuring of our ceded reinsurance arrangements and the recognition of reinstatement premiums associated with the increase in catastrophe and large losses. Ceded written premiums increased in our reinsurance segment due to new business opportunities written in conjunction with increased retrocession, additional ceded written premiums following the sale of AgriLogic in December 2017 and the recognition of reinstatement premiums associated with the increase in catastrophe losses.\nCeded written premiums increased by 57.6% in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of new business opportunities written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession, and as a result of a restructure of our ceded reinsurance arrangements aimed at reducing earnings volatility and benefiting the expense ratio through an increase in over-rider commissions.\nCombined ratio. We monitor the ratio of losses and expenses to net earned premium (the combined ratio\u201d) as a measure of relative performance where a lower ratio represents a better result than a higher ratio. The combined ratios for our two business segments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\n\n__________________\n (1) The total combined ratio includes the impact from corporate expenses.  The combined ratio for 2017 increased by 27.2 percentage points compared to 2016 due mainly to the increase in the loss ratio. The increase in loss ratio was due primarily to a $409.6 million increase in catastrophe losses, a $59.7 million increase in large losses, a $23.9 million decrease in prior year reserve releases, an increase in attritional losses in our insurance segment and a $330.7 million decrease in net earned premiums. The expense ratio increased by 0.5 percentage point due to a reduction in net earned premiums and an increase in general, administrative and corporate expenses partially offset by a decrease in policy acquisition expenses due to over-rider commissions associated with the increase in ceded reinsurance.\nThe combined ratio for 2016 increased by 6.6 percentage points compared to 2015 due to a 4.6 percentage point increase in the loss ratio and a 2.0 percentage point increase in the expense ratio. The loss ratio increase was due primarily to a $75.9 million increase in catastrophe losses and a $27.2 million reduction in the level of prior year reserve releases. The increase in expense ratio was due to higher acquisition and general administrative and corporate expenses. The increase in the expense ratio was due to an increase in the acquisition ratio due to higher profit commission accruals and lower ceding commissions in the insurance segment and changes in business mix in the reinsurance segment. The increase in general, administrative and corporate expenses was due to costs associated with AgriLogic, growth in our insurance and reinsurance business and reorganization costs.\nIn each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded a reduction in the level of reserves for prior years. In 2017, we reported net favorable development on prior year loss reserves of $105.4 million, or 4.6 combined ratio points, compared with $129.3 million, or 4.9 combined ratio points, for 2016, and $156.5 million, or 6.3 combined ratio points, for 2015.\nOverall reserve releases in 2017 decreased by $23.9 million compared to 2016 mainly due to an $18.7 million decrease in net reserve releases in our insurance segment from $42.3 million in 2016 to $23.6 million in 2017. Overall reserve releases in 2016 reduced by $27.2 million compared to 2015 due mainly to a $23.4 million decrease in net reserve releases in our insurance segment from $65.7 million in 2015 to $42.3 million in 2016. Reserve releases in our reinsurance segment in 2015 decreased from $90.8 million in 2015 to $87.0 million in 2016. Further information relating to the release of reserves can be found below under - Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses - Prior Year Loss Reserves.\u201d\nAmortization of deferred policy acquisition costs decreased in 2017 compared to 2016 due to an increase in over-rider commissions associated with the increase in ceded reinsurance. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs increased in 2016 compared to 2015 in line with premium growth and higher profit commission accruals and lower ceding commissions in the insurance segment offsetting the Federal Excise Tax ( FET\u201d) refunds and changes in business mix in the reinsurance segment.\nGeneral, administrative and corporate expenses increased to $502.2 million in 2017 from $490.1 million in 2016 and $424.0 million in 2015. The increase in such expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was largely due to $15.2 million of costs associated with the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program and increased costs associated with growth in our insurance business partially offset by lower provisions for performance-related remuneration. The increase in 2016 compared to 2015 was largely due to costs associated with AgriLogic which we acquired in January 2016 (and subsequently sold in December 2017), costs associated with growth in our insurance and reinsurance business and reorganization costs.\nNet investment income. We generated net investment income of $189.0 million in 2017, an increase of 1.0% on the prior year (2016 - $187.1 million; 2015 - $185.5 million). The increase was primarily due to the increase in the book yield of the fixed income portfolio. The increase in investment income in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a higher investment balance and $20.4 million of dividend income from our global equity securities portfolio compared with $20.1 million in 2015.\nTaxes. We recognized a tax credit in 2017 of $15.4 million (2016 - $6.1 million expense; 2015 - $14.4 million expense), equivalent to a consolidated rate on our loss before tax of 5.5% in 2017 compared to a consolidated rate on our profit before tax of 2.9% in 2016 and 4.3% in 2015. The income tax credit for 2017 takes into account a tax credit associated with the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d and a tax credit regarding deductions available for certain research and development expenditure. The tax credit in 2017 has not been materially affected by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was\nsigned on December 22, 2017. The impact of the U.S. federal income tax rate reduction from 34% to 21% has been reflected in measuring deferred taxes.\nThe effective tax rate for the year is subject to revision in future periods if circumstances change and depends on the relative profitability of the business underwritten in Bermuda (where the rate of tax on corporate profits is zero), the United Kingdom (where the corporation tax rate is 19% and will be reduced to 17% effective April 1, 2020) and the United States (where the federal income tax rate was previously 34% and has been reduced to 21% effective January 1, 2018). The tax in each of the years is representative of the geographic spread of our business between taxable and non-taxable jurisdictions in such years.\nNet income. We reported a net loss after taxes of $266.4 million in 2017 compared to net income of $203.4 million in 2016 and net income of $323.1 million in 2015. The net loss in 2017 was primarily due to the $625.5 million decrease in underwriting income resulting mainly from a $409.6 million increase in catastrophe losses, a $330.7 million reduction in net earned premiums and a $23.9 million reduction in reserve releases, partially offset by a $116.3 million reduction in expenses. The decrease in income after tax in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to a $137.7 million decrease in underwriting income resulting from higher catastrophe losses, lower reserve releases and increased expenses partially offset by growth in premiums earned.\nOther comprehensive income. Total other comprehensive income decreased by $50.8 million (2016 - $64.7 million decrease), net of taxes, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. This consists of a net unrealized loss of $9.2 million in the available for sale investment portfolio (2016 - $28.8 million net unrealized loss) largely attributable to the impact of rising interest rates on our bond portfolios, a $3.6 million reclassification of net realized gains to net income (2016 - $8.9 million reclassified realized gains), a $2.6 million unrealized gain (2016 - $0.7 million unrealized gain) on the hedged derivative contracts and an unrealized loss in foreign currency translation of $40.6 million (2016 -$27.7 million unrealized loss) largely attributable to the impact from the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nDividends. In April 2017, the Board approved an increase in the quarterly dividend on our ordinary shares from $0.22 per ordinary share to $0.24 per ordinary share (2016 - $0.22 quarterly dividend; 2015 - $0.20 quarterly dividend). This resulted in total ordinary dividends for 2017 of $56.2 million (2016 - $52.7 million; 2015 - $50.9 million). Dividends paid on the outstanding Preference Shares in 2017 were $36.2 million (2016 - $41.8 million; 2015 - $37.8 million). The reduction in dividends in 2017 was due to the redemption of the 7.401% and 7.250% Preference Shares.\nShareholders' equity and financial leverage. Total shareholders' equity decreased by $719.8 million from $3,648.3 million as at December 31, 2016 to $2,928.5 million as at December 31, 2017. The most significant movements were:\n \u2022 a decrease of $365.4 million in retained earnings due to the net loss of $266.4 million and the payment of $92.4 million in ordinary and preference share dividends; \n \u2022 a reduction of $50.8 million in other comprehensive income; \n \u2022 the redemption of $133.2 million 5,327,500 7.401% Preference Shares; \n \u2022 the redemption of $160.0 million 6,400,000 7.250% Preference Shares; and \n \u2022 the repurchase of 648,941 ordinary shares for $30.0 million through open market and other repurchases.  As at December 31, 2017, our total shareholders' equity included Preference Shares with a total value as measured by their respective liquidation preferences of $525.0 million (2016 - $818.2 million) less issue costs of $13.1 million (2016 - $21.1 million).\nOur senior notes were the only material debt issued by Aspen Holdings as at December 31, 2017 and 2016 totaling $549.5 million and $549.3 million, respectively. In addition to the senior notes, we also reported $86.6 million (2016 - $223.4 million) of debt issued by Silverton. For further information relating to Silverton, refer to Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements, Variable Interest Entities.\u201d\nManagement monitors the ratio of the total of debt and hybrids to total capital, with total capital being defined as shareholders' equity plus outstanding debt and excluding loan notes issued by variable interest entities. As at December 31, 2017, the debt to capital ratio was 15.8% (2016 - 13.1%). The ratio increased due to the reduction in our retained earnings as a result of the increase in catastrophe losses impacting both our insurance and reinsurance segments, an increased frequency of large and attritional losses in our insurance segment and the redemption of the 7.401% Preference Shares and 7.250% Preference Shares in 2017. The Preference Shares are classified in our balance sheet as equity but may receive a different treatment in some cases under the capital adequacy assessments made by certain rating agencies. We also monitor the ratio of the total debt and the liquidation preference of our Preference Shares to total capital which was 30.5% as at December 31, 2017 (2016 - 32.1%). The ratio reduced due to the redemption of the 7.401% Preference Shares and 7.250% Preference Shares in 2017.\nDiluted book value per ordinary share as at December 31, 2017 was $40.10, a decrease of 14.2% compared to $46.72 as at December 31, 2016. Book value per ordinary share is based on total shareholders' equity, less preference shares (liquidation preference less issue expenses) and non-controlling interests, divided by the number of ordinary shares in issue at the end of the period.\nBalances as at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\n\nMarket Conditions, Rate Trends and Developments\nOverall, the rate environment has improved in both our reinsurance and insurance segments following one of the costliest years of catastrophe losses on record in 2017.\nWe achieved an overall rate increase of approximately 6% for our reinsurance business during the January 1, 2018 renewals where we renewed approximately 50% of our annual book of reinsurance business. In addition, our Aspen Capital Markets business continues to provide investors with direct access to our underwriting expertise, and to provide brokers and clients with additional capacity. It also gives us the flexibility to manage our exposures.\nWhile the January 1, 2018 renewals are less important for our insurance business, we achieved double digit percentage rate increases in marine and energy liability, marine hull, U.S. ocean marine and U.S. property and we obtained approximately 5% to 10% rate increases in U.S. energy and U.S. environmental. We achieved a rate increase of approximately 14% for our U.S. property book in conjunction with improved terms and conditions. Other insurance lines of business achieved up to 4% rate increases during the January 1, 2018 renewals.\nFollowing the large catastrophe losses in 2017, we continue to seek to balance our insurance portfolio and to target the best risk-adjusted returns. As a result, we expect to reduce our exposure to major property accounts that contain considerable catastrophe accumulations. As a result of the increased frequency of large and attritional losses in our insurance segment in 2017, we have likewise taken a more risk-averse view by retaining less risk and ceding more premiums with the aim to stabilize earnings. We have also significantly reduced our voluntary participation into our internal reinsurance vehicle. As a result of these actions, we expect our net written premium to gross written premium ratio to reduce to 60% in 2018.\nWe continue to expect that our Effectiveness and Efficiency Program will deliver savings of approximately $30 million in 2018, $55 million in 2019 and $75 million in 2020, after which run-rate savings are expected to be approximately $80 million per year. As a result of the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program, we expect our total expense ratio to continue to decline over the next three years.\nIn addition, we expect the recently enacted U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to have a modest impact on the amount of tax that we will pay. We expect that the U.S. tax bill will decrease net income by approximately $10 million or more in 2018 although the ultimate impact will depend on where our profits are generated.\nSee Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included in this report.\nRecent Developments\nOn January 5, 2018, we notified the Prudential Regulation Authority of our intention to close Aspen U.K.'s branches in Paris, France and Cologne, Germany. We expect these branches to be closed during the first quarter of 2018.\nDuring January 2018, we sold $206.9 million of equity securities from our investment portfolio and realized a net gain of $36.7 million.\nOn January 26, 2018, S&P affirmed the ratings of our Operating Subsidiaries but changed their outlook to negative from stable. On February 6, 2018, Moody's affirmed the ratings of our Operating Subsidiaries but changed their outlook to negative from stable. Both rating agencies stated certain factors which, if not achieved, could lead the relevant rating agency to downgrade the ratings of our Operating Subsidiaries. See Risk Factors - Our Operating Subsidiaries are rated and our Lloyd's business benefits from a rating by one or more of A.M. Best, S&P and Moody's and a decline in any of these ratings could adversely affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our premiums and earnings to decrease and limit our ability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares\u201d for a discussion of some potential risks relating to our ratings.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective in nature and require management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine the reported values. We believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. A statement of all the significant accounting policies we use to prepare our financial statements is included in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. If factors such as those described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d cause actual events to differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting policy and calculating financial results, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nWritten Premiums\nWritten premiums comprise the estimated premiums on contracts of insurance and reinsurance entered into in the reporting period, except in the case of proportional reinsurance contracts, where written premiums relate only to our estimated proportional share of premiums due on contracts entered into by the ceding company prior to the end of the reporting period.\nAll premium estimates are reviewed regularly, comparing actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums along with a review of the collectability of premiums receivable. Based on management's review, the appropriateness of the premium estimates is evaluated, and any adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the periods in which they become known. Adjustments to original premium estimates could be material and these adjustments may directly and significantly impact earnings in the period they are determined because the subject premium may be fully or substantially earned.\nWe refer to premiums receivable which are not fixed at the inception of the contract as adjustment premiums. The proportion of adjustment premiums included in the premium estimates varies between business lines with the largest adjustment premiums associated with property and casualty reinsurance business and the smallest with property and liability insurance lines.\nAdjustment premiums are most significant in relation to reinsurance contracts. Different considerations apply to non-proportional and proportional treaties as follows:\nNon-proportional treaties. A large number of the reinsurance contracts we write are written on a non-proportional or excess of loss treaty basis. As the ultimate level of business written by each cedant can only be estimated at the time the reinsurance is placed, the reinsurance contracts generally stipulate a minimum and deposit premium payable under the contract with an adjustable premium determined by variables such as the number of contracts covered by the reinsurance, the total premium received by the cedant and the nature of the exposures assumed. Minimum and deposit premiums generally cover the majority of premiums due under such treaty reinsurance contracts and the adjustable portion of the premium is usually a small portion of the total premium receivable. For excess of loss contracts, the minimum and deposit premium, as defined in the contract, is generally considered to be the best estimate of the contract's written premium at inception. Accordingly, this is the amount we generally record as written premium in the period the underlying risks incept.\nDuring the life of a contract, notifications from cedants and brokers may affect the estimate of ultimate premium and result in either increases or reductions in reported revenue. Changes in estimated adjustable premiums do not generally have a significant impact on short-term liquidity as the payment of adjustment premiums generally occurs after the expiration of a contract.\nMany non-proportional treaties also include a provision for the payment to us by the cedant of reinstatement premiums based on loss experience under such contracts. Reinstatement premiums are the premiums charged for the restoration of the reinsurance limit of an excess of loss contract to its full amount after payment by the reinsurer of losses as a result of an occurrence. These premiums relate to the future coverage obtained during the remainder of the initial policy term and are included in revenue in the same period as the corresponding losses.\nProportional treaties ( treaty pro rata\u201d). Estimates of premiums assumed under treaty pro rata reinsurance contracts are recorded in the period in which the underlying risks are expected to incept and are based on information provided by brokers and ceding companies and estimates of the underlying economic conditions at the time the risk is underwritten. We estimate premiums\nreceivable initially and update our premium estimates regularly throughout the contract term based on treaty statements received from the ceding company.\nThe reported gross written premiums for treaty pro rata business include estimates of premiums due to us but not yet reported by the cedant because of time delays between contracts being written by our cedants and their submission of treaty statements to us. This additional premium is normally described as pipeline premium. Treaty statements disclose information on the underlying contracts of insurance written by our cedants and are generally submitted on a monthly or quarterly basis, from 30 to 90 days in arrears. In order to report all risks incepting prior to a period end, we estimate the premiums written between the last submitted treaty statement and the period end. Treaty pro rata premiums are written predominantly in our other property, specialty and casualty reinsurance line of business.\nProperty treaty pro rata made a significant contribution to our reinsurance segment where we wrote $242.5 million in gross written premium in 2017 (2016 - $226.7 million), or 15.7% of the gross written premium in our reinsurance segment, of which $76.6 million was estimated (2016 - $53.1 million) and $165.9 million was reported by the cedants (2016 - $173.6 million). Excluding the impact of fixed costs, such as reinsurance premiums and operating expenses, we estimate that the impact of a $1.0 million increase / decrease in our estimated gross written premiums in our property treaty pro rata business would increase / decrease net income before tax by approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 (2016 - $0.1 million increase /decrease).\nThe most likely drivers of change in our premium estimates in decreasing order of magnitude are:\n \u2022 changes in the renewal rate or rate of new business acceptances by the cedant insurance companies leading to lower or greater volumes of ceded premiums than our estimate, which could result from changes in the relevant primary market that could affect more than one of our cedants or could be a consequence of changes in marketing strategy or risk appetite by a particular cedant; \n \u2022 changes in the rates being charged by cedants; and \n \u2022 differences between the pattern of inception dates assumed in our estimate and the actual pattern of inception dates.  We anticipate that ultimate premiums might reasonably be expected to vary by up to 5% as a result of variations in one or more of the assumptions described above, although larger variations are possible. Based on gross written premiums of $242.5 million (2016 - $226.7 million) in our property reinsurance treaty pro rata account as at December 31, 2017, a variation of 5% could increase or reduce net income before tax by approximately $1.2 million (2016 - $0.5 million).\nEarned premiums. Premiums are recognized as earned over the policy exposure periods. The premium related to the unexpired portion of each policy at the end of the reporting period is included in the balance sheet as unearned premiums.\nReserving Approach\nWe are required by U.S. GAAP to establish loss reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses ( ultimate losses\u201d) under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers. Our loss reserves comprise the following components:\n \u2022 the cost of claims reported to us but not yet paid known as case reserves ( case reserves\u201d); \n \u2022 IBNR reserves to cover the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not reported. Within this, we also include the potential development of reported claims; and \n \u2022 the expenses associated with settling claims, including legal and other fees and the general expenses of administering the claims adjustment process, known as the loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d).  Prior to the selection of the reserves to be included in our financial statements, our actuarial team employs a number of techniques to establish a range of estimates from which they consider it reasonable for management to select a \u2018best estimate' (the actuarial range\u201d).\nCase Reserves. For reported claims, reserves are established on a case-by-case basis within the parameters of coverage provided in the insurance policy or reinsurance agreement. The method of establishing case reserves for reported claims differs among our operations. With respect to our insurance operations, we are advised of potential insured losses and our claims handlers record reserves for the estimated amount of the expected indemnity settlement, loss adjustment expenses and cost of defense where appropriate. The reserve estimate reflects the judgment of the claims personnel and is based on claim information obtained to date, general reserving practices, the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature of the specific claim and where appropriate and available, advice from legal counsel, loss adjusters and other claims experts.\nWith respect to our reinsurance claims operations, claims handlers set case reserves for reported claims generally based on the claims reports received from our ceding companies and take into consideration our cedants' own reserve recommendations and our prior loss experience with the cedant. Additional case reserves ( ACR\u201d), in addition to the cedants' own recommended reserves, may be established by us to reflect our estimated ultimate cost of a loss. ACRs are generally the result of either a claims handler's own experience and knowledge of handling similar claims, general reserving practices or the result of reserve recommendations following an audit of cedants' reserves.\nCase reserves are based on a subjective judgment of facts and circumstances and are established for the purposes of internal reserving only. Accordingly, they do not represent a commitment to any course of conduct or admission of liability on our behalf in relation to any specific claim.\nIBNR Reserves. The need for IBNR reserves arises from time lags between when a loss occurs and when it is actually reported and settled. By definition, we do not have specific information on IBNR claims so they need to be estimated by actuarial methodologies. IBNR reserves are therefore generally calculated at an aggregate level and cannot generally be identified as reserves for a particular loss or contract. We calculate IBNR reserves by class of business within each line of business. Where appropriate, analyses may be conducted on sub-sets of a class of business. IBNR reserves are calculated by projecting our ultimate losses on each class of business and subtracting paid losses and case reserves. IBNR reserves also cover the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not reported, within this we also include any potential development of reported claims. Over recent years, we have begun to place greater reliance on our actual actuarial experience for our long-tail lines of business that we have written since our inception in 2002. We believe that our earliest accident years are now capable of providing us with meaningful actuarial indications. Estimates and judgments for new insurance and reinsurance lines of business are more difficult to make than those made for more mature lines of business because we have more limited historical information through December 31, 2017.\nSources of Information. Claims information received typically includes the loss date, details of the claim, the recommended reserve and reports from the loss adjusters dealing with the claim. In respect of pro rata treaties and any business written through managing general agents, we receive regular statements (bordereaux) which provide paid and outstanding claims information, often with large losses separately identified. Following widely reported loss events, such as catastrophes and airplane crashes, we adopt a proactive approach to establish our likely exposure to claims by reviewing policy listings and contacting brokers and policyholders as appropriate.\nActuarial Methodologies. The main projection methodologies that are used by our actuaries are as follows:\n \u2022 Initial expected loss ratio ( IELR\u201d) method: This method calculates an estimate of ultimate losses by applying an estimated loss ratio to an estimate of ultimate earned premium for each accident year. The estimated loss ratio may be based on pricing information and/or industry data and/or historical claims experience revalued to the year under review. \n \u2022 Bornhuetter-Ferguson ( BF\u201d) method: The BF method uses as a starting point an assumed IELR and blends in the loss ratio, which is implied by the claims experience to date using benchmark loss development patterns on paid claims data ( Paid BF\u201d) or reported claims data ( Reported BF\u201d). Although the method tends to provide less volatile indications at early stages of development and reflects changes in the external environment, it can be slow to react to emerging loss development and can, if the IELR proves to be inaccurate, produce loss estimates which take longer to converge with the final settlement value of loss. \n \u2022 Loss development ( Chain Ladder\u201d) method: This method uses actual loss data and the historical development profiles on older accident years to project more recent, less developed years to their ultimate position. \n \u2022 Exposure-based method: This method is typically used for specific large catastrophic events such as a major hurricane. All exposure is identified and we work with known market information and information from our cedants to determine a percentage of the exposure to be taken as the ultimate loss.  In addition to these methodologies, our actuaries may use other approaches depending upon the characteristics of the class of business and available data.\nIn general terms, the IELR method is most appropriate for classes of business and/or accident years where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet mature enough to modify our initial expectations of the ultimate loss ratios. Typical examples would be recent accident years for classes of business in casualty reinsurance. The BF method is generally appropriate where there are few reported claims and a relatively less stable pattern of reported losses. Typical examples would be our treaty risk excess class of business in our reinsurance segment and marine hull class of business in our insurance segment. The Chain Ladder method is appropriate when there are relatively stable patterns of loss emergence and a relatively large number of reported claims. Typical examples are the U.K. commercial property and U.K. commercial liability classes of business in our international insurance business.\nReserving Procedures and Process. Our actuaries calculate the IELR, BF and Chain Ladder and, if appropriate, other methods for each class of business and each accident year. They then calculate a single point actuarial mean best estimate ( ultimate\u201d) for each class of business and provide a stochastic distribution around the mean for each line of business. The actuarial methodologies involve significant subjective judgments reflecting many factors, including but not limited to, changes in legislative conditions, changes in judicial interpretation of legal liability policy coverages and inflation. Our actuaries collaborate with our underwriting, claims, legal and finance teams in identifying factors which are incorporated in their range of ultimates in which management's best estimate is most likely to fall. The actuarial stochastic distribution is designed to provide management with a range from which it is reasonable to select a single management best estimate for inclusion in our financial statements.\nThere are no differences between our year-end and our quarterly internal reserving procedures and processes because our actuaries perform the basic projections and analyses described above for each class of business quarterly.\nSelection of Reported Gross Reserves. Management, through its Reserve Committees, reviews the actuarial stochastic distribution and any other evidence before selecting its management best estimate of reserves for each line of business. Management selects the management best estimate\u201d by considering all the information provided to them and by considering the risks and uncertainties within the actuarial mean best estimate. Management has to date selected its best estimate above that of the actuarial mean best estimate and within the range of the actuarial stochastic distribution. This provides the basis for the recommendation to the Audit Committee and the Board made by management regarding the reserve amounts and related disclosures to be recorded in our financial statements.\nThere are three Reserve Committees, one for each of the insurance and reinsurance segments and a core\u201d committee that makes final reserving recommendations. The core\u201d Reserve Committee currently consists of the Group Chief Risk Officer (the chair), the Group Head of Capital Management, the Group Head of Risk, the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Insurance Chief Financial Officer and the President and Chief Underwriting Officer of Aspen Re. Senior members of the insurance and reinsurance segment underwriting and claims staff comprise the remaining members of each of the insurance and reinsurance reserve committees, respectively.\nEach class of business within each line of business is reviewed in detail by management through its Reserve Committee at least once a year. The timing of such reviews varies throughout the year. Additionally, we review the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations every fiscal quarter for all classes of business. If warranted from this analysis, we may accelerate the timing of our detailed actuarial reviews.\nUncertainties. While the management selected reserves make a reasonable provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense obligations, we note that the process of estimating required reserves, by its very nature, involves uncertainty and therefore the ultimate claims may fall outside the actuarial range. The level of uncertainty can be influenced by such factors as the existence of coverage with long duration reporting patterns and changes in claims handling practices, as well as the other factors described above.\nBecause many of the coverages underwritten involve claims that may not be ultimately settled for many years after they are incurred, subjective judgments as to the ultimate exposure to losses are an integral and necessary component of the loss reserving process. We review our reserves regularly, using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze current claims costs, frequency and severity data, and prevailing economic, social and legal factors. Reserves established in prior periods are adjusted as claims experience develops and new information becomes available.\nEstimates of IBNR are generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than estimates of the cost of settling claims already notified to us, where more information about the claim event is generally available. IBNR claims often may not be apparent to the insured until many years after the event giving rise to the claims has happened. Classes of business where the IBNR proportion of the total reserve is high, such as casualty insurance, will typically display greater variations between initial estimates and final outcomes because of the greater degree of difficulty of estimating these reserves.\nClasses of business where claims are typically reported relatively quickly after the claim event tend to display lower levels of volatility between initial estimates and final outcomes. Reinsurance claims are subject to a longer time lag both in their reporting and in their time to final settlement. The time lag is a factor which is included in the projections to ultimate claims within the actuarial analyses and helps to explain why in general a higher proportion of the initial reinsurance reserves are represented by IBNR than for insurance reserves for business in the same class. Delays in receiving information from cedants are an expected part of normal business operations and are included within the statistical estimate of IBNR to the extent that current levels of backlog are consistent with historical data. Currently, there are no processing backlogs which would materially affect our financial statements.\nAllowance is made, however, for changes or uncertainties which may create distortions in the underlying statistics or which might cause the cost of unsettled claims to increase or reduce when compared with the cost of previously settled claims, including:\n \u2022 changes in our processes which might accelerate or slow down the development and/or recording of paid or incurred claims; \n \u2022 changes in the legal environment (including challenges to tort reform); \n \u2022 the effects of inflation; \n \u2022 changes in the mix of business; \n \u2022 the impact of large losses; and \n \u2022 changes in our cedants' reserving methodologies.  These factors are incorporated in the recommended reserve range from which management selects its best point estimate. We take all reasonable steps to ensure that we utilize all appropriate information and actuarial techniques in establishing our IBNR reserves. However, given the uncertainty in establishing claims liabilities, it is likely that the final outcome will prove to be different from the original provision established at the balance sheet date. Changes to our previous estimates of prior period loss reserves impact the reported calendar year underwriting results by worsening our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be deficient or improving our reported results if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant. As at December 31, 2017, a 5% change in the gross reserve for IBNR losses would have equated to a change of approximately $186.0 million in loss reserves which would represent 66.0% of loss before income tax for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. As at December 31, 2016, a 5% change in the gross reserve for IBNR losses would have equated to a change of approximately $152.2 million in loss reserves which would represent 72.6% of income before income tax for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. A 5% change in our net loss reserves equates to $261.7 million and represents 5.0% of shareholders' equity as at December 31, 2017.\nThere are specific areas of our selected reserves which have additional uncertainty associated with them. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors -Insurance Risks - Our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected if actual claims exceed our loss reserves\u201d for a discussion of the specific areas of our selected reserves which have additional uncertainty. In each case, management believes they have selected an appropriate best estimate based on current information and current analyses.\nLoss Reserving Sensitivity Analysis. The most significant key assumptions identified in the reserving process are that (i) the historic loss development and trend experience is assumed to be indicative of future loss development and trends, (ii) the information developed from internal and independent external sources can be used to develop meaningful estimates of the initial expected ultimate loss ratios, and (iii) no significant losses or types of losses will emerge that are not represented in either the initial expected loss ratios or the historical development patterns.\nWe believe that there is potentially significant risk in estimating loss reserves for long-tail lines of business and for immature accident years that may not be adequately captured through traditional actuarial projection methodologies. As discussed above, these methodologies usually rely heavily on projections of prior year trends into the future. In selecting our best estimate of future liabilities, we consider both the results of actuarial point estimates of loss reserves in addition to the stochastic distribution of reserves. In determining the appropriate best estimate, we review (i) the position of overall reserves within the actuarial distribution, (ii) the result of bottom up analysis by accident year reflecting the impact of parameter uncertainty in actuarial calculations, and (iii) specific qualitative information on events that may have an effect on future claims but which may not have been adequately reflected in actuarial best estimates, such as the potential for outstanding litigation or claims practices of cedants to have an adverse impact.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions. Given the risks and uncertainties associated with the process for estimating reserves for losses and loss expenses, management has performed an evaluation of the potential variability in loss reserves and the impact this variability may have on reported results, financial condition and liquidity. Because of the inherent uncertainties discussed above, we have developed a reserving philosophy which attempts to incorporate prudent assumptions and estimates, and we have generally experienced favorable net development on prior year reserves in the last several years. However, there is no assurance that this will occur in future periods.\nManagement's best estimate of the net reserve for losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2017 was $5,234.3 million. The following tables show the effect on estimated net reserves for losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2017 of a change in two of the most critical assumptions in establishing reserves: (i) loss emergence patterns, accelerated or decelerated by three and six months; and (ii) expected loss ratios varied by plus or minus five and ten percent. Management believes that these scenarios present a reasonable range of variability around the booked reserves using standard actuarial techniques. Loss reserves may vary beyond these scenarios in periods of heightened or reduced claim activity. The reserves resulting from the changes in the assumptions\nare not additive and should be considered separately. The following tables vary the assumptions employed therein independently. In addition, the tables below do not adjust any parameters other than the ones described above.\nNet reserve for losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2017 - Sensitivity to loss emergence patterns\n\nNet reserve for losses and loss expenses as at December 31, 2017 - Sensitivity to expected loss ratios\n\nThe most significant variance in the above scenarios (i.e., a 10% deterioration in expected loss ratio) would have the effect of increasing losses and loss expenses by $343.0 million.\nManagement believes that the reserve for losses and loss expenses are sufficient to cover expected claims incurred before the reporting date on the basis of the methodologies and judgments used to support its estimates. However, there can be no assurance that actual payments will not vary significantly from total reserves. The reserve for losses and loss expenses and the methodology of estimating such reserve are regularly reviewed and updated as new information becomes known. Any resulting adjustments are reflected in income in the period in which they become known.\nResults of Operations\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The discussions that follow include tables and discussions relating to our consolidated income statement and our segmental operating results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nConsolidated Income Statement\n\nGross written premiums. The following table analyzes the overall change in gross written premiums for our two business segments in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\n____________________\n (1) Includes gross written premium of $269.7 million (2016 - $178.9 million, 2015 -$Nil) related to AgriLogic. \nOverall gross written premiums increased by 6.8% in 2017 compared to 2016. Gross written premiums in our reinsurance segment increased by 9.6% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to growth in agriculture insurance business written within specialty reinsurance and due to $32.3 million of reinstatement premiums associated with catastrophe losses. Gross written premiums from our insurance segment increased by 4.5% due to growth in financial and professional lines insurance partially offset by reductions in marine, aviation and energy insurance where we continue to experience challenging market conditions and in property and casualty insurance as a result of a change in our appetite for this type of business.\nOverall gross written premiums in 2016 increased by 5.0% compared to 2015 due primarily to our specialty reinsurance and casualty reinsurance business lines. The increase in our specialty reinsurance business was largely due to growth in agriculture business written following our acquisition of AgriLogic in January 2016 (which was subsequently sold in December 2017) and growth in specialty marine business. The increase in casualty reinsurance lines of business was largely due to growth in our U.S. casualty treaty and international casualty business lines. Premiums from our insurance segments reduced slightly due to reductions in our property and casualty and marine, aviation and energy business lines offset by growth in financial and professional lines insurance.\nCeded written premiums. The following table analyzes the overall change in ceded written premiums for our two business segments in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\nTotal ceded written premiums in 2017 increased by $595.1 million compared to 2016. Ceded written premiums increased in both segments in part due to the purchase of a whole account quota share contract. Ceded reinsurance premiums increased for our insurance segment due to the restructure of our ceded reinsurance arrangements though the use of significant quota share reinsurance arrangements and the recognition of ceded premiums to reinstate cover following catastrophe and other large losses. Ceded reinsurance premiums also increased for our reinsurance segment due to increased reinsurance for our property catastrophe and other property business lines due to new business opportunities which were written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession, an increase in ceded reinsurance premiums following the sale of AgriLogic in December 2017 and due to the recognition of additional ceded premiums as a result of reinstating cover following catastrophe losses. Due to these changes, the retention ratio, which is defined as net written premium as a percentage of gross written premium, decreased from 82.4% in 2016 to 65.8% in 2017.\nIn 2016, total ceded written premiums increased by $202.2 million compared to 2015. Ceded reinsurance costs increased for our reinsurance segment due to increased ceded reinsurance for our property catastrophe business line for new business opportunities written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession costs and due to our agriculture business reported in our specialty reinsurance business line. Ceded reinsurance costs increased for our insurance segment because we restructured our ceded reinsurance arrangements to reduce earnings volatility and benefit the expense ratio. In addition, we purchased an adverse development cover in the fourth quarter of 2016 for certain casualty business which we have ceased to underwrite. These changes led the retention ratio to decrease from 88.3% in 2015 to 82.4% in 2016.\nNet premiums earned. The following table analyzes the overall change in net premiums earned for our two business segments in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\n____________________\n(1) Includes net earned premium of $198.8 million (2016 - $114.5 million, 2015 -$Nil) related to AgriLogic.\nNet premiums earned decreased by $330.7 million, or 12.5%, in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a $453.6 million increase in ceded earned premiums partially offset by a $122.9 million increase in gross earned premiums. Net premiums earned increased by $164.0 million, or 6.6%, in 2016 compared to 2015 due to growth in gross earned premium and the impact from and the increases in ceded written premiums in 2016 not substantially flowing into earnings until 2017.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses. The loss ratio for 2017 of 86.5% increased by 26.7 percentage points compared to 2016. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased from $1,576.1 million in 2016 to $1,994.7 million in 2017. The increase in the loss ratio was largely due to a $409.6 million increase in catastrophe losses, a $59.7 million increase in large losses, a $23.9 million decrease in prior year reserve releases and a decrease in net earned premiums, as above. In 2017, net losses from major catastrophes increased by $409.6 million to $576.0 million compared with $166.4 million in 2016. Large losses in 2017 included $64.0 million of fire-related losses, a $12.6 million surety loss, an $11.1 million loss related to cyber and terrorism and a $4.8 million loss from a refinery explosion.\nThe loss ratio for 2016 of 59.8% increased by 4.6 percentage points compared to 2015. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased from $1,366.2 million in 2015 to $1,576.1 million in 2016 due to an increase in large and catastrophe losses, changes in business mix towards lines which have higher non-catastrophe loss ratios and a reduction in reserve releases. In 2016, net losses from major catastrophes increased by $75.9 million to $166.4 million compared with $90.5 million in 2015. Large losses in 2016 included $32.7 million of energy-related losses, $11.8 million of fire-related losses and a $4.2 million aviation loss.\nIn the reinsurance segment, the loss ratio for 2017 was 92.6% compared to 55.7% in 2016 largely due to a $352.5 million increase in catastrophe losses, a $25.3 million increase in large losses and a $5.2 million decrease in reserve releases. In 2017, we experienced $467.3 million of catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, associated with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, wildfires in California, earthquakes in Mexico and other weather-related events in the U.S. and Australia. In the comparable period in 2016, we experienced $114.8 million of natural catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, associated with wildfires in Canada, earthquakes in Japan and Taiwan, Hurricane Matthew and other weather-related events in the U.S. and Europe.\nIn the insurance segment, the loss ratio for 2017 was 79.8% compared to 63.1% in 2016. The increase in the loss ratio was largely due to a $57.1 million increase in catastrophe losses, a $34.4 million increase in large losses, an increase in attritional losses, an $18.7 million decrease in reserve releases and a decrease in net earned premiums. In 2017, there were $108.7 million of catastrophe losses associated with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, wildfires in California and U.S. weather-related events. The loss ratio for 2016 was 63.1% compared to 62.4% for 2015. The increase in the loss ratio in 2016 was mainly due to a decrease of $23.4 million in prior year reserve releases and a $10.7 million increase in catastrophe losses. In 2016, our insurance segment experienced $51.6 million of catastrophe losses associated with U.S. weather-related events and Hurricane Matthew.\nOverall, prior year reserve releases decreased by $23.9 million from $129.3 million in 2016 to $105.4 million in 2017. The reinsurance segment had reserve releases of $81.8 million compared to $87.0 million in 2016. The reserve releases from the reinsurance segment were across all reinsurance business lines. The insurance segment had reserve releases of $23.6 million compared to $42.3 million in 2016. The reserve releases from the insurance segment were principally from marine, energy and aviation insurance.\nOverall, prior year reserve releases reduced by $27.2 million from $156.5 million in 2015 to $129.3 million in 2016. The reserve releases from reinsurance were across all business lines, totaling $87.0 million. The insurance segment had reserve releases of $42.3 million compared to $65.7 million in 2015. The reserve releases from insurance were from marine, energy and aviation insurance and financial and professional lines insurance.\nWe have presented loss ratios both including and excluding the impact from catastrophe losses to aid in the analysis of the underlying performance of our segments. We have defined major 2017 catastrophe losses as losses associated with Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the earthquakes in Mexico, a tornado in Mississippi, Cyclone Debbie in Australia, wildfires in California and other U.S. weather-related events. We have defined major 2016 catastrophe losses as losses associated with wildfires in North America, Hurricane Matthew and other weather-related events in the U.S., several earthquakes and a hailstorm in the Netherlands. We have defined major 2015 catastrophe losses as losses associated with winter storms in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, storms in the U.S., U.S. wildfires, the Chilean earthquake, U.K. floods and weather-related events in the Philippines.\nThe underlying changes in loss ratios by segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are shown in the tables below. The total loss ratio represents the calendar year U.S. GAAP loss ratio. The current year adjustments represent catastrophe loss events incurred in those years which reflect net claims and reinstatement premium adjustments.\n\n\n\nExpenses. We monitor the ratio of expenses to gross earned premium (the gross expense ratio\u201d) as a measure of the cost effectiveness of our amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, general, administrative and corporate expenses. The tables below present the contribution of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and general, administrative and corporate expenses to the gross expense ratios and the total net expense ratios for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. We also show the effect of reinsurance purchased which impacts the reported net expense ratio by expressing the expenses as a proportion of net earned premiums.\n\n\n\n____________________\n(1) The total group general and administrative expense ratio includes corporate and non-operating expenses. Comparative ratios have been re-presented to include corporate and non-operating expenses.\nPolicy acquisition expenses decreased by $128.4 million in 2017 compared to 2016 as although gross policy acquisition expenses increased this was more than offset by an increase in over-rider commissions associated with the increase in ceded reinsurance. Policy acquisition expenses increased by $45.3 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to growth in written premiums and higher profit commission accruals.\nThe decrease in the policy acquisition expense ratio, gross of the effect of reinsurance, to 18.6% in 2017 from 18.9% in 2016 is due to a reduction in profit commission accruals in the insurance segment partially offset by an increase in the acquisition ratio in the reinsurance segment due to an increase in profit commission accruals and the prior year benefiting from FET refunds.\nThe reduction in the policy acquisition expense ratio, gross of the effect of reinsurance, to 18.9% in 2016 from 19.0% in 2015 was due to FET refunds and changes in business mix toward agriculture and specialty marine business lines which have lower average commission rates.\nGeneral, administrative and corporate expenses increased by $12.1 million from $490.1 million in 2016 to $502.2 million in 2017 due to $15.2 million of costs associated with the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program, and increased costs associated with growth in our insurance business, partially offset by lower provisions for performance-related remuneration. General, administrative and corporate expenses increased by $66.1 million from $424.0 million in 2015 to $490.1 million in 2016 due to costs associated with AgriLogic which we acquired in January 2016 and subsequently sold in December 2017, costs associated with growth in our insurance and reinsurance business and reorganization costs.\nInvestment gains. Total net realized and unrealized investment gains for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $120.5 million (2016 - losses of $45.2 million; 2015 - losses of $17.0 million).\nNet investment income. In 2017, we generated net investment income of $189.0 million, an increase of 1.0% on the prior year (2016 - $187.1 million, 2015 - $185.5 million). The increase was primarily due to the increase in the book yield of the fixed income portfolio despite a reduction in dividend income following the sale of a portion of our equity portfolio in the third quarter of 2017. The increase in investment income in 2016 compared with 2015 was primarily due to an increase in invested assets.\nForeign exchange contracts. We use foreign exchange contracts to manage foreign currency risk. A foreign exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract. Foreign exchange contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time.\nAs at December 31, 2017, we held foreign exchange contracts that were not designated as hedging under ASC 815 - \"Derivatives and Hedging\" with a notional amount of $751.6 million (2016 - $665.6 million). The foreign exchange contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value in the balance sheet with changes recorded as a change in fair value of derivatives in the statement of operations. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the impact of foreign exchange contracts on net income was a gain of $27.7 million (December 31, 2016 - loss of $21.5 million).\nAs at December 31, 2017, we held foreign exchange contracts that were designated as hedging under ASC 815 with a notional amount of $60.6 million (2016 - $108.6 million). The foreign exchange contracts are recorded as derivatives at fair value in the balance sheet with the effective portion recorded in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion recorded as a change in fair value of derivatives in the statement of operations. The contracts are considered to be effective and therefore the movement in other comprehensive income representing the effective portion was a gain of $3.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 - gain of $0.7 million).\nAs the foreign exchange contracts settle, the realized gain or loss is reclassified from other comprehensive income into general, administration and corporate expenses of the statement of operations and other comprehensive income. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the amount recognized within general, administration and corporate expenses for settled foreign exchange contracts was a realized gain of $4.4 million (December 31, 2016 - loss of $8.7 million recognized within general, administration and corporate expenses).\nInterest on long-term debt. Interest on long-term debt is the interest due on our senior notes.\nIncome before tax. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, loss before tax was $281.8 million (2016 - income of$209.5 million; 2015 - income of $337.5 million), consisting of the amounts set out in the table below:\n\nThe decrease in underwriting income in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to higher catastrophe losses, lower reserve releases, an increase in large losses, an increase in attritional losses in the insurance segment and a reduction in premiums earned offset by a reduction in expenses. The decrease in underwriting income in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to higher catastrophe losses, lower reserve releases and an increase in expenses, partially offset by growth in premiums earned.\nThe increase in corporate and non-operating expenses in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to $15.2 million of costs associated with implementing the Effectiveness and Efficiency Program and higher salary costs due to increased headcount as a result of growth in our insurance and reinsurance business, partially offset by reductions in performance-related remuneration provisions. The increase in corporate and non-operating expenses in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to higher salary costs due to increased headcount as result of growth in our insurance and reinsurance business and reorganization costs.\nChange in fair value of derivatives. The change in fair value of derivatives in 2017 was attributable to foreign exchange contracts that had a gain of $27.7 million compared to a loss of $21.5 million in 2016 and a gain of $11.6 million in 2015. Interest rate swaps\nhad a realized loss of $3.1 million and $4.8 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. There was no gain or loss in 2017 because we terminated our interest rate swaps on May 6, 2016.\nThe $21.2 million change in fair value of loan notes issued by variable interest entities represents the proportion of profit or loss generated by Silverton attributable to third-party investors. The reduction in the value of the loan notes in 2017 is due to catastrophe losses assumed by Silverton. The increase in the value in 2016 and 2015 is due to premiums received by Silverton being greater than the losses assumed.\nIncome tax expense. There was an income tax credit for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 of $15.4 million compared to an expense of $6.1 million and $14.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 on our loss before tax was 5.5% (2016 - 2.9%; 2015 - 4.3%) and is representative of the geographic spread of our business between taxable and non-taxable jurisdictions.\nNet income after tax. In 2017, we had net loss after tax of $266.4 million, equivalent to $5.22 basic loss per ordinary share adjusted for the $36.2 million preference share dividends, $8.0 million of preference share redemption costs and $1.3 million non-controlling interest. Fully diluted loss per ordinary share was $5.22 for 2017. In 2016, we had net income after tax of $203.4 million, equivalent to $2.67 basic earnings per ordinary share adjusted for the $41.8 million preference share dividends and $0.1 million non-controlling interest. Fully diluted earnings per ordinary share were $2.61 in 2016. In 2015, we had net income after tax of $323.1 million, equivalent to fully diluted earnings per ordinary share of $4.54. For a more detailed description of basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share, see Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements, Earnings per Ordinary Share.\u201d\nUnderwriting Results by Business Segment\nWe are organized into two business segments: reinsurance and insurance. The Company has determined its reportable segments, Aspen Insurance and Aspen Re, by taking into account the manner in which management makes operating decisions and assesses\noperating performance.\nManagement measures segment results on the basis of the combined ratio, which is obtained by dividing the sum of the losses and loss expenses, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and operating and administrative expenses by net premiums earned. Other than corporate expenses, indirect operating and administrative expenses are allocated to segments predominantly based on each segment's proportional share of gross earned premiums.\nNon-underwriting disclosures. We provide additional disclosures for corporate and other (non-underwriting) income and expenses. Corporate and other income and expenses include net investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains or losses, expenses associated with managing the Group, certain strategic and non-recurring costs, changes in fair value of derivatives and changes in fair value of loan notes issued by variable interest entities, interest expense, net realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses and income taxes, which are not allocated to the business segments. Corporate expenses are not allocated to our business segments as they typically do not fluctuate with the levels of premiums written and are not directly related to our segment operations.\nWe do not allocate our assets by segment as we evaluate underwriting results of each segment separately from the results of our investment portfolio. Segment profit or loss for each of our operating segments is measured by underwriting profit or loss. See Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements, Segment Reporting\u201d for information on gross and net premiums written and earned, underwriting results, and combined ratios and reserves for each of our business segments.\nReinsurance\nOur reinsurance segment consists of property catastrophe, other property reinsurance, casualty and specialty reinsurance. For a more detailed description of this segment, see Part I, Item 1, Business - Business Segments - Reinsurance\u201d and Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements, Segment Reporting.\u201d\nGross written premiums. The table below shows our gross written premiums for each line of business for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and the percentage change in gross written premiums for each line of business:\n\nThe increase in property catastrophe reinsurance gross written premiums was primarily due to $22.2 million of reinstatement premiums associated with catastrophe losses recognized in 2017 partially offset by premium reductions due to challenging market conditions and downward revisions on premium estimates. The increase in other property reinsurance gross written premiums was largely due to reductions in premium estimates for proportional contracts in the comparative period. Gross written premiums in casualty reinsurance decreased slightly due to reductions in U.S. casualty treaty business lines. The increase in gross written premiums in specialty reinsurance was predominantly due to growth in agriculture insurance business, as well as growth in engineering and cyber business lines.\nThe 13.2% increase in gross written premiums for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 compared to the equivalent period in 2015 was attributable to increased business written in our specialty reinsurance and casualty reinsurance business lines. The increase in our specialty reinsurance gross written premiums was mainly due to growth in agriculture business written following our acquisition of AgriLogic in January 2016. The increase in our casualty reinsurance gross written premiums was largely due to growth in our U.S. casualty treaty and international casualty business lines. The slight decrease in property catastrophe reinsurance gross written premiums was largely due to reductions in business written due to challenging market conditions, partially offset by new business opportunities which were written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession costs. The decrease in other property reinsurance gross written premiums was largely due to challenging market conditions and adjustments in prior year premium estimates on proportional contracts.\nCeded written premiums. Total ceded written premiums in 2017 was $298.5 million, an increase of $154.5 million compared to 2016. Ceded written premiums increased across all lines of business due to the purchase of a whole account quota share contract in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in ceded written premiums in property catastrophe and other property reinsurance was due to new business opportunities which were written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession. Ceded written premiums also increased in property catastrophe and other property reinsurance due to the recognition of ceded costs to reinstate cover following catastrophe losses. The increase in ceded written premiums in specialty reinsurance was due to an increase in retrocession costs following the sale of our agriculture business in December 2017. Total ceded written premiums in 2016 was $144.0 million, an increase of $48.6 million compared to $95.4 million in 2015. The largest increase in ceded written premiums in 2016 was in specialty reinsurance as a result of increased retrocession costs following the acquisition of AgriLogic in January 2016 and in property catastrophe reinsurance due to new business opportunities which were written in conjunction with an increase in retrocession costs.\nNet premiums earned. Net premiums earned increased by $24.2 million, or 2.0%, in 2017 compared to 2016 largely due to increased business written in specialty reinsurance and inwards reinstatement premiums associated with catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased ceded costs. Net premiums earned increased by $109.3 million, or 10.2%, in 2016 compared to 2015 largely due to increased business written in specialty reinsurance and casualty reinsurance, partially offset by increased ceded costs in specialty reinsurance and property catastrophe reinsurance lines.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses. The loss ratio in 2017 of 92.6% increased by 36.9 percentage points compared to 55.7% in 2016. The increase in the loss ratio was mainly due to a $352.5 million increase in catastrophe losses. The increase in the loss ratio was compounded by a $5.2 million decrease in prior year reserve releases compared to 2016 and $25.3 million of large fire related losses, the largest of which was a fire in a chemical plant, compared with no large losses in 2016. In 2017, our reinsurance segment experienced $467.3 million of catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance recoveries, including $72.1 million from Hurricane Harvey, $119.6 million from Hurricane Irma, $57.1 million from Hurricane Maria, $16.6 million from the earthquakes in Mexico, $7.2 million from a tornado in Mississippi, $5.7 million from Cyclone Debbie in Australia, $125.8 million from the wildfires in California and $32.9 million from U.S. weather-related events.\nThe loss ratio in 2016 of 55.7% increased compared to 45.8% in 2015 mainly due to an increase in catastrophe losses of $65.2 million, changes in business mix towards lines which have higher non-catastrophe ratios and a $3.8 million decrease in prior year reserve releases. In 2016, our reinsurance segment experienced $114.8 million of catastrophe losses, including $35.4 million from the wildfires in Canada, $10.5 million from an earthquake in New Zealand, $9.3 million from Hurricane Matthew, $8.5 million from an earthquake in Japan, $9.2 million from U.S wildfires, $5.0 million from a hailstorm in the Netherlands, $2.3 million from an earthquake in Taiwan and $31.2 million from U.S. weather-related events.\nThe $5.2 million reduction in prior year reserve releases from $87.0 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 to $81.8 million in the current period included a $13.1 million reinsurance recovery in respect of an offshore energy-related loss that occurred in Africa and adverse development of $12.8 million in casualty reinsurance due to the U.K. Ministry of Justice decision to increase the discount rate used to calculate lump sum awards in U.K. bodily injury cases, known as the Ogden rate. The $3.8 million decrease in prior year reserve releases from $90.8 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to $87.0 million in 2016 was due predominantly to a decrease in reserve releases from casualty lines. Prior year reserve releases are further discussed below under Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.\u201d\nPolicy acquisition, general and administrative expenses. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs were $235.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, equivalent to 19.5% of net premiums earned (2016 - $226.4 million or 19.2% of net premiums earned; 2015 - $224.7 million or 20.9% of net premiums earned). The increase in the acquisition ratio is due to an increase in profit commission accruals and the prior period benefiting from FET refunds. The decrease in policy acquisition expense ratio in 2016 compared with 2015 was due to FET refunds and changes in business mix towards agriculture and specialty marine business lines, which have lower average commission rates, and away from other property, casualty and specialty business written on a pro rata basis which have higher average commission rates.\nOur general and administrative expenses decreased by $20.9 million from $178.2 million in 2016 to $157.3 million in 2017. Our general and administrative expense ratio was 13.0% in 2017 compared to 15.1% in 2016 due to a lower provision for performance-related remuneration. Our general and administrative expense ratio of 15.1% in 2016 increased from 13.7% in 2015 due predominantly to costs associated with AgriLogic.\nInsurance\nOur insurance segment consists of property and casualty insurance, marine, aviation and energy insurance, and financial and professional lines insurance. For a more detailed description of this segment, see Part I, Item 1, Business - Business Segments - Insurance\u201d and Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements, Segment Reporting.\u201d\nGross written premiums. The table below shows our gross written premiums for each line of business for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and the percentage change in gross written premiums for each line:\n\nThe decrease in gross written premiums in property and casualty insurance was largely attributable to reductions in primary global casualty and program business as a result of a change in our appetite for this type of business, partially offset by growth in our U.K. regional and excess casualty business lines. The decrease in gross written premiums in marine, aviation and energy insurance was largely attributable to continued challenging market conditions in marine and energy liability and aviation business lines. The increase in gross written premiums in financial and professional lines insurance was largely attributable to growth in our management liability, surety, cyber and accident and health business lines.\nThe decrease in gross written premiums in 2016 compared to 2015 in property and casualty insurance was largely attributable to reductions in our global casualty, U.S. casualty and U.S. environmental business lines, partially offset by growth in our U.S. excess casualty and railroad insurance business lines. The decrease in gross written premiums in marine, aviation and energy insurance was largely due to challenging market conditions in our marine and energy liability, U.S. inland marine, offshore energy, and energy and construction insurance business lines, partially offset by growth in our ocean cargo and aviation insurance business lines. The increase in gross written premiums in financial and professional lines insurance was largely attributable to growth in our accident and health, credit and political risks, management liability and financial institutions business lines.\nCeded written premiums. Total ceded written premiums for 2017 was $849.9 million, an increase of $440.6 million from 2016. Ceded written premiums increased as a result of the impact from restructuring our ceded reinsurance arrangements in the second half of 2016 and in particular through the use of significant quota share reinsurance arrangement which aim to reduce earnings volatility and benefit the expense ratio through an increase in over-rider commissions. Ceded written premiums also increased across all lines of business due to the purchase of a whole account quota share contract and due to the recognition of ceded costs to reinstate cover following catastrophe losses.\nCeded reinsurance for 2016 was $409.3 million, an increase of $153.6 million from 2015. Ceded reinsurance increased across all our business lines because we restructured our ceded reinsurance arrangements to seek to reduce volatility and benefit the expense ratio. In addition, we purchased an adverse development cover in the fourth quarter of 2016 for certain casualty business which we ceased to underwrite.\nNet premiums earned. Net premiums earned decreased by $354.9 million, or 24.4%, in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the impact from the increase in ceded written premiums. Net premiums earned increased by $54.7 million, or 3.9%, in 2016 compared to 2015 due to written premium growth in 2016 and the impact from the increases in ceded written premiums in 2016 not flowing into earnings until 2017.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses. The loss ratio in 2017 was 79.8% compared to 63.1% in 2016. The increase in the loss ratio in 2017 was primarily due a $57.1 million increase in catastrophe losses, an $18.7 million decrease in prior year reserve releases, a $34.4 million increase in large losses, an increase in attritional losses in U.S. property, primary casualty and management liability classes and a decrease in net earned premiums. The loss ratio in 2016 increased from 62.4% in 2015 due primarily to a $23.4 million reduction in prior year reserve releases and a $10.7 million increase in catastrophe losses.\nIn 2017, the insurance segment experienced $108.7 million of catastrophe losses, consisting of $22.4 million from Hurricane Harvey, $20.6 million from Hurricane Irma, $13.2 million from Hurricane Maria, $10.2 million from wildfires in California, and $42.3 million from U.S. weather-related events. Large losses experienced during 2017 included $38.7 million of fire-related losses, a $12.6 million surety loss, an $11.1 million loss related to cyber and terrorism and a $4.8 million refinery explosion.\nIn 2016, the insurance segment experienced $51.6 million of catastrophe losses, consisting of $39.9 million associated with U.S. weather-related events and $11.7 million from Hurricane Matthew. Large losses experienced during 2016 included $32.7 million of energy-related losses, $11.8 million of fire-related losses and a $4.2 million aviation loss.\nIn 2015, the insurance segment experienced $40.9 million of catastrophe losses, consisting of $25.7 million associated with U.K. floods and $15.2 million associated with U.S. storms. Large losses included $37.6 million of energy losses, $10.0 million associated with a dam collapse in Brazil and $3.0 million associated with the port explosion in Tianjin, China.\nIn 2017, there were reserve releases of $23.6 million compared to $42.3 million of reserve releases in 2016. The reserve releases were principally from our marine, aviation and energy business lines which included an additional $15.4 million reinsurance recovery in respect of an offshore energy-related loss that occurred in Africa which offset adverse development in property and casualty insurance and financial and professional lines insurance. The reserve releases in 2016 were predominantly from marine, energy and aviation insurance and financial and professional lines insurance offsetting adverse development in our property and casualty insurance. Prior year reserve releases are further discussed under Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.\u201d\nPolicy acquisition, general and administrative expenses. Amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs were $165.0 million in 2017, equivalent to 15.0% of net premiums earned (2016 - $302.5 million or 20.8% of net premiums earned; 2015 - $258.9 million or 18.5% of net earned premium). The decrease in the acquisition expense ratio in 2017 compared with 2016 was due to lower profit commission accruals and an increase in over-rider commissions. The increase in the acquisition expense ratio in 2016 compared with 2015 was due to higher profit commission accruals and lower ceding commissions.\nOur general and administrative expenses increased by $25.5 million to $253.9 million in 2017 from $228.4 million in 2016. Our general and administrative expense ratio was 23.1% in 2017 compared to 15.7% in 2016 due predominantly to costs associated with growth in the business. General and administrative expenses of $228.4 million in 2016 increased from $213.6 million in 2015 largely due to costs associated with growth in the business.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal cash and investments\nAs at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, total cash and investments, including accrued interest receivable, were $8.7 billion and $9.2 billion, respectively. Total cash and investments decreased mainly as a result of increased payments associated with the increase in ceded written premiums and due to increased claims payments during 2017. Our investment strategy is focused on delivering stable investment income and total return through all market cycles while maintaining appropriate portfolio liquidity and credit quality to meet the requirements of our customers, rating agencies and regulators.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our investments consisted of a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities including U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt, global equities and money market funds. Our overall portfolio strategy remains focused on high quality fixed income investments. In the third quarter of 2017, we took advantage of rising equity markets and sold $208.1 million of our equity portfolio. Proceeds from the sales were reinvested into a core fixed income strategy. As at December 31, 2017, we had a 5.8% (2016 -6.8%) position in equities, a 4.0% (2016 - 3.8%) position in U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt and 0.2% (2016 -0.2%) in risk asset portfolio cash. As at December 31, 2017, approximately 10% of our total cash and investments, excluding catastrophe bonds and funds held by variable interest entities (the Managed Portfolio\u201d), was invested in equities and U.S. Dollar BBB Emerging Market Debt (2016 - 10.8%).\nBook yield for the year ended December 31, 2017 on the fixed income portfolio was 2.56%, an increase of 7.0 basis points from 2.49% at December 31, 2016, as a result of rising interest rates. Our fixed income portfolio duration as at December 31, 2017 was 3.90 years compared to 3.89 as at December 31, 2016. As at December 31, 2017, the average credit quality of our fixed income portfolio was AA-,\u201d with 88.9% of the portfolio being rated A\u201d or higher. As at December 31, 2016, the average credit quality of our fixed income portfolio was AA-,\u201d with 89.3% of the portfolio being rated A\u201d or higher. Where the credit ratings were split between the two main rating agencies, S&P and Moody's, the lowest rating was used.\nUnrealized gains in the available for sale investment portfolio, net of taxes and including equity securities, were $9.7 million as at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $12.8 million from December 31, 2016.\nAs at December 31, 2017, we had investments in four entities classified as other investments, equity method: a micro-insurance incubator ( MVI\u201d), Bene Assicurazioni ( Bene\u201d), Digital Risk Resources, LLC ( Digital Re\u201d) and Crop Re Services LLC ( Crop Re\u201d). For further information regarding these investments, see Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements, Investments.\u201d\nThe composition of our cash and investments as at December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below:\n\nOur mortgage-backed portfolio is supported by loans diversified across a number of geographic and economic sectors. The following table summarizes the fair value of our mortgage-backed securities by rating and class as at December 31, 2017:\n\nSub-prime securities. We define sub-prime related investments as those supported by, or containing, sub-prime collateral based on creditworthiness. We do not invest directly in sub-prime related securities.\nEquity securities. Equity securities are comprised of U.S. and foreign equity securities and are classified as available for sale or trading. In 2015 as a result of rebalancing equity investments across subsidiary company balance sheets, equities were sold that were classified as available for sale, with a commensurate purchase of equities designated as trading securities. As at December 31, 2015, all equity securities were classified as trading. In the fourth quarter of 2016 and third quarter of 2017, we took advantage of rising equity markets and sold $200.0 million and $208.1 million respectively, of our equity portfolio. The total investment return from the available for sale and trading equity portfolios for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: \n\nValuation of Investments\nFair Value Measurements. Our estimates of fair value for financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance included in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. For a description of the framework, see Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements, Fair Value Measurements.\u201d\nValuation of Other Investments, Equity Method. The value of our investments in MVI, Chaspark, Bene, Digital Re and Crop Re are based on our share of the capital position of the entities which includes income and expenses reported in quarterly management accounts. Each of MVI, Chaspark, Bene, Digital Re and Crop Re is subject to annual audit evaluating the financial statements of the entities. We periodically review the management accounts of MVI, Chaspark, Bene, Digital Re and Crop Re and evaluate the reasonableness of the valuation of our investment.\nOther-than-temporary Impairment of Investments. We review all our available for sale fixed income and equity investments on an individual security basis for potential OTTI each quarter based on criteria including issuer-specific circumstances, credit\nratings actions and general macro-economic conditions. There was a $0.7 million OTTI charge for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 (2016 -$Nil).\nFor further discussion, see Note 2(c) of our consolidated financial statements, Basis of Preparation and Significant Accounting Policies - Accounting for Investments, Cash and Cash Equivalents.\u201d\nReserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\nProvision is made at the end of each year for the estimated ultimate cost of claims incurred but not settled at the balance sheet date, including the cost of IBNR claims and development of existing reported claims. The estimated cost of claims includes expenses to be incurred in settling claims and a deduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries. Estimated amounts recoverable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are calculated to arrive at a net claims reserve.\nReserves by segment. As at December 31, 2017, we had total net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves of $5,234.3 million (December 31, 2016 - $4,759.2 million). This amount represented our best estimate of the ultimate liability for payment of losses and loss adjustment expenses. Of the total gross reserves for unpaid losses of $6,749.5 million at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2017, a total of $3,720.8 million, or 55.1%, represented IBNR claims (December 31, 2016 - $3,044.9 million and 57.2%, respectively). The following tables analyze gross and net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by business segment as at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively:\n\n\nThe increase in reinsurance recoverables in 2017 was due predominantly to additional reinsurance purchased to reduce earnings volatility in addition to the impact from a loss portfolio transfer described in Note 12 of our consolidated financial statements, Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses.\u201d The recoveries in the reinsurance segment are generally associated with catastrophes and levels of recoveries fluctuate based on the type of catastrophe.\nThe gross reserves may be further analyzed between outstanding claims and IBNR as at December 31, 2017 and 2016 as follows:\n\n\nPrior year loss reserves. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, there was an overall reduction in our estimate of ultimate net claims to be paid in respect of prior accident years. An analysis of this reduction by business segment is as follows for each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The analysis of the development by each segment is as follows:\nReinsurance. Net reserve releases of $81.8 million in 2017 were mainly as a result of favorable development across our property catastrophe and other property reinsurance lines. The specialty reinsurance business lines reported favorable development and the recognition of additional prior year ceded recoveries in respect of an offshore energy-related loss that occurred in Africa. The casualty reinsurance business line reported a net reserve release due to favorable development despite our exposure to the Ogden rate change from reinsurance of U.K. employer's liability and U.K. public liability business and, to a lesser degree, U.K. motor liability reinsurance.\nInsurance. Net reserve releases of $23.6 million in 2017 were mainly as a result of favorable development and the recognition of additional prior year ceded recoveries in our marine, aviation and energy business line in respect of an offshore energy-related loss that occurred in Africa. Net reserves were strengthened in property and casualty lines due to adverse development in our casualty lines following the change in the Ogden rate which impacted our U.K. employer's liability and U.K. public liability business and increases in loss reserves associated with the purchase of an adverse development cover. Financial and professional lines reported an increase in prior year reserves due to adverse development in the management liability account.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The analysis of the development by each segment is as follows:\nReinsurance. Net reserve releases of $87.0 million in 2016 were attributable to all lines of business. The largest releases in the period were $39.7 million from other property reinsurance lines, $18.9 million from specialty reinsurance lines and $14.9 million from casualty reinsurance lines due to better than expected claims development.\nInsurance. Net reserve releases of $42.3 million in 2017 were attributable to net reserve releases of $38.9 million from marine, aviation and energy lines and $15.3 million from financial and professional lines due to better than expected development partially offset by an $11.9 million net reserve strengthening in property and casualty lines.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. The analysis of the development by each segment is as follows:\nReinsurance. Net reserve releases of $90.8 million in 2015 were attributable to all lines of business. The largest releases in the period were $32.6 million from specialty reinsurance lines due primarily to benign incurred experience and $25.5 million from casualty reinsurance and $24.8 million from other property reinsurance lines due to favorable development.\nInsurance. Net reserve releases of $65.7 million in 2015 were largely attributable to net reserve releases of $53.7 million from property and casualty lines and $8.8 million from financial and professional lines. The most significant factor affecting the level of release in 2015 was the release of a small number of case reserves where we saw favorable claims development.\nOther than the matters described under - Critical Accounting Policies - Reserving Approach,\u201d we did not make any significant changes in methodologies used in our reserving process.\nCapital Management\nThe following table shows our capital structures as at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016:\n\n____________________\n (1) We do not consider the Loan Notes issued by Silverton to be part of our permanent capital as the noteholders have no recourse to the other assets of the Company.  As at December 31, 2017, total shareholders' equity was $2,928.5 million compared to $3,648.3 million as at December 31, 2016. Our total shareholders' equity as at December 31, 2017 includes two classes of preference shares with a total value as measured by their respective liquidation preferences of $511.9 million net of share issuance costs (December 31, 2016 - $797.1 million, four classes of preference shares).\nOur preference shares are classified in our balance sheet as equity but may receive a different treatment in some cases under the capital adequacy assessments made by certain rating agencies. Such securities are often referred to as hybrids\u201d as they have certain attributes of both debt and equity. We also monitor the ratio of the total of debt and hybrids to total capital which was 30.5% as of December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 - 32.1%).\nOur senior notes were the only material debt issued by Aspen Holdings as at December 31, 2017 and 2016 of $549.5 million and $549.3 million, respectively.\nIn addition to the senior notes issued by Aspen Holdings, we have also reported $86.6 million of debt issued by Silverton. For further information relating to Silverton, refer to Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements, Variable Interest Entities.\u201d\nWe monitor the ratio of the total of debt and hybrids to total capital, with total capital being defined as shareholders' equity plus outstanding debt and excluding loan notes issued by variable interest entities, which was 15.8% as at December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 - 13.1%).\nThe principal capital management transactions during 2017 were as follows:\n \u2022 On January 3, 2017, we elected to redeem all of the outstanding 7.401% Preference Shares. Each holder of a 7.401% Preference Share received $25 per 7.401% Preference Share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends. \n \u2022 On February 8, 2017, we replaced our existing share repurchase authorization with a new authorization of $250.0 million. The share repurchase authorization, which is effective through February 8, 2019, permits us to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of transactions, including open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions and accelerated share repurchase transactions. \n \u2022 On April 26, 2017, we announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to our ordinary shareholders from $0.22 per ordinary share to $0.24 per ordinary share. \n \u2022 On July 3, 2017, we elected to redeem all of the outstanding 7.250% Preference Shares. Each holder of a 7.250% Preference Share received $25 per 7.250% Preference Share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends. \n \u2022 For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 648,941 ordinary shares in open market repurchases for a total consideration of $30.0 million at an average price of $46.23 per ordinary share. As at December 31, 2017, we had $220.0 million remaining under our $250.0 million share repurchase authorization program.  The principal capital management transactions during 2016 were as follows:\n \u2022 On April 21, 2016, we announced a 5.0% increase in our quarterly dividend to our ordinary shareholders from $0.21 per ordinary share to $0.22 per ordinary share. \n \u2022 On September 20, 2016, we issued the 5.625% Preference Shares for total net proceeds of $241.3 million, consisting of $250.0 million of total liquidation preference less $8.7 million of issue expenses. The 5.625% Preference Shares have no stated maturity but are callable at our option on or after the 10 year anniversary of the date of issuance. \n \u2022 For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, we acquired and canceled a total of 1,595,076 ordinary shares in open market repurchases. We paid a total consideration of $75.0 million and an average price of $47.02 per ordinary share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. As at December 31, 2016, we had $341.3 million remaining under our then existing $500.0 million share repurchase authorization program.  Access to capital. Our business operations are in part dependent on our financial strength, the opinions of the independent rating agencies thereof as discussed elsewhere in this report and the market's perception thereof, as measured by total shareholders' equity, which was $2,928.5 million as at December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 - $3,648.3 million). We believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds through debt or equity financing. Our continuing ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other things, our operating results, market conditions and our perceived financial strength. See Risk Factors - We may repurchase additional capital in the future, which may not be available of may only be available on unfavourable terms.\u201d We regularly monitor our capital and financial position, as well as investment and securities market conditions, both in general and with respect to Aspen Holdings' securities. Our ordinary shares and all our preference shares are listed on the NYSE.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short-term and long-term cash requirements of its business operations. Management monitors the liquidity of Aspen Holdings and of each of its Operating Subsidiaries and arranges credit facilities to enhance short-term liquidity resources on a stand-by basis. As a holding company, Aspen Holdings relies on dividends and other distributions from its Operating Subsidiaries to provide cash flow to meet ongoing cash requirements, including any future debt service payments and other expenses, and to pay dividends, if any, to our preference and ordinary shareholders.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, Aspen Holdings received dividends of $360.0 million (2016 - $234.5 million) from Aspen Bermuda and $13.6 million (2016 - $63.4 million) from Aspen European. In addition, Aspen Holdings received $18.7 million in respect of an intercompany loan from Aspen European (2016 - $21.6 million).\nAs at December 31, 2017, Aspen Holdings held $111.4 million (December 31, 2016 - $327.1 million) of cash, cash equivalents and investments with the reduction largely due to the costs associated with the redemption of the 7.401% Preference Shares on January 3, 2017 and the redemption of the 7.250% Preference Shares on July 3, 2017. Management considers the current cash and cash equivalents, together with dividends declared or expected to be declared by subsidiary companies and our credit facilities, sufficient to appropriately satisfy the liquidity requirements of Aspen Holdings. Aspen Holdings' liquidity depends on dividends, capital distributions and interest payments from our Operating Subsidiaries. Aspen Holdings has recourse to the credit facility described below.\nThe ability of our Operating Subsidiaries to pay us dividends or other distributions is subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the Operating Subsidiaries' need to maintain capital requirements adequate to maintain their insurance and reinsurance operations and their financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies. In line with common market practice for regulated institutions, the PRA previously requested that it be afforded with the opportunity to provide a non-objection\u201d prior to all future dividend payments made by Aspen U.K. In 2017, the PRA stated that they no longer routinely require Aspen U.K. to apply for a non-objection to dividends provided that such dividend payment and Aspen U.K.'s subsequent capital position are within Aspen U.K.'s board-approved solvency capital risk appetite. We do not expect to suffer tax on foreign earnings since our significant source of earnings outside of Bermuda is the U.K. and no taxes are imposed on profits repatriated from the U.K. to Bermuda. For a further discussion of the various restrictions on our ability and our Operating Subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, see Part I, Item 1 Business - Regulatory Matters.\u201d For a discussion of the volatility and liquidity of our other investments, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Market and Liquidity Risks,\u201d and for a discussion of the impact of insurance losses on our liquidity, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - Insurance Risks\u201d and Note 15 of our consolidated financial statements, Statutory Requirements and Dividend Restrictions.\u201d\nOperating Subsidiaries. As at December 31, 2017, the Operating Subsidiaries held $821.7 million (December 31, 2016 - $1,409.3 million) in cash and short-term investments that are readily realizable securities. The reduction is largely due to the costs associated with the increase in ceded reinsurance and the significant level of claims activity in 2017. Management monitors the value, currency and duration of cash and investments held by its Operating Subsidiaries to ensure they are able to meet their insurance and other liabilities as they become due and, despite the year-on-year decrease, was satisfied that there was a comfortable margin of liquidity as at December 31, 2017 and for the foreseeable future.\nOn an ongoing basis, our Operating Subsidiaries' sources of funds primarily consist of premiums written, investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments. Cash is used primarily to pay reinsurance premiums, losses and loss adjustment expenses, brokerage commissions, general and administrative expenses, taxes, interest and dividends and to purchase new investments. The potential for individual large claims and for accumulations of claims from single events means that substantial and unpredictable payments may need to be made within relatively short periods of time.\nFor all material currencies in which our underwriting activities are written we ensure that sufficient cash and short-term investments are held in such currencies to enable us to meet potential claims without liquidating long-term investments and adversely affecting our investment return. This follows the matching principle which matches our assets and liabilities in currency to mitigate foreign currency risk whenever possible.\nWe manage these risks by making regular forecasts of the timing and amount of expected cash outflows and ensuring that we maintain sufficient balances in cash and short-term investments to meet these estimates. Notwithstanding this policy, if these cash flow forecasts are incorrect, we could be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity, potentially at a significant loss. Historically, we have not had to liquidate investments at a significant loss to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity.\nWhere we incur losses in currencies which are not normally held we will convert funds into the appropriate currencies to mitigate our currency risk and also make funds available to settle claims in local currencies as and when they become due. Recent examples of this have been where we have converted funds to Mexican Peso, Chilean Peso and Chinese Yuan to cover earthquake and other losses in these countries. For local regulatory reasons, we hold assets in trusts which limits our liquidity to some degree. The process of matching assets with liabilities in currency means, however, that at any one time we will hold cash and short-term assets in all major currencies which are available to settle claims.\nThe liquidity of our Operating Subsidiaries is also affected by the terms of our contractual obligations to policyholders and by undertakings to certain regulatory authorities to facilitate the issue of letters of credit or maintain certain balances in trust funds for the benefit of policyholders. The following table shows the forms of collateral or other security provided in respect of these obligations and undertakings as at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:\n\nSee Note 19(a), Commitments and Contingencies - Restricted Assets\u201d of our consolidated financial statements for further detail on our trust fund balances which we are required to maintain in accordance with contractual obligations to policyholders and in compliance with regulatory requirements.\nConsolidated cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Total net cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $(111.5) million, a decrease of $564.7 million from the equivalent period in 2016. The negative cash flows from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were due to the significant increase in ceded reinsurance costs and claims activity in 2017. We paid net claims of $1,555.1 million in 2017 and generated cash inflows of $419.0 million from investing and net purchases and sales of equipment during the period. We paid ordinary share and preference share dividends of $92.4 million, and $30.0 million was used to repurchase ordinary shares. At December 31, 2017, we had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of $1,054.8 million.\nConsolidated cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Total net cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was $453.2 million, a decrease of $121.0 million from the equivalent period in 2015. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, our cash flows from operations provided us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We paid net claims of $1,222.8 million in 2016, and used $350.9 million in investing and net purchases and sales of equipment during the period. We paid ordinary and preference share dividends of $94.5 million, and $75.0 million was used to repurchase ordinary shares. At December 31, 2016, we had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of $1,273.8 million.\nConsolidated cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Total net cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was $574.2 million, a decrease of $33.2 million from the equivalent period in 2014. For the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2015, our cash flows from operations provided us with sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We paid net claims of $1,108.5 million in 2015, and used $501.9 million in investing and net purchases and sales of equipment during the period. We paid ordinary and preference share dividends of $88.7 million, and $83.7 million was used to repurchase ordinary shares. At December 31, 2015, we had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of $1,099.5 million.\nLetter of Credit Facilities. See Note 22, Credit Facility and Long-term Debt\u201d of our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our credit agreements and letter of credit facilities.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations (other than our obligations to employees and our Preference Shares) under long-term debt, operating leases (net of subleases) and reserves relating to insurance and reinsurance contracts as at December 31, 2017:\n\n__________________\n (1) The long-term debt obligations disclosed above do not include the $29.0 million annual interest payments on our outstanding senior notes or dividends payable to holders of our preference shares or the loan notes issued by Silverton in the amount of $86.6 million. \n (2) In estimating the time intervals into which payments of our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses fall, as set out above, we have utilized actuarially assessed payment patterns. By the nature of the insurance and reinsurance contracts under which these liabilities are assumed, there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods shown and there could be a material acceleration or deceleration of claims payments depending on factors outside our control. The total amount of payments in respect of our reserves, as well as the timing of such payments, may differ materially from our current estimates for the reasons set out under - Critical Accounting Policies - Reserves for Losses and Loss Expenses\u201d above.  For a detailed description of our operating lease obligations, see Part I, Item 2, Properties.\u201d\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs at December 31, 2017, we were not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K, to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that we believe is material to investors.\nIn November 2016, Peregrine, a subsidiary of the Company, was registered as a segregated accounts company under the Bermuda Segregated Accounts Companies Act 2000, as amended. As at December 31, 2017, Peregrine had formed four segregated accounts which were funded by a third party investor. The segregated accounts have not been consolidated as part of the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation may have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations by its effect on interest rates and on the cost of settling claims. The potential exists after a catastrophe or other large property loss, such as the hurricanes in 2017, for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy as the demand for services, such as construction, typically surges. The cost of settling claims may also be increased by global commodity price inflation. We seek to take both these factors into account when setting reserves for any events where we think they may be material.\nOur calculation of reserves for losses and loss expenses in respect of casualty business includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims-handling expenses, such as medical treatments and litigation costs. We write casualty\nbusiness in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia and certain other territories, where claims inflation has in many years run at higher rates than general inflation. To the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims, we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in earnings. The actual effects of inflation on our results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled.\nIn addition to general price inflation, we are exposed to a persisting long-term upwards trend in the cost of judicial awards for damages. We seek to take this into account in our pricing and reserving of casualty business.\nWe also seek to take into account the projected impact of inflation on the likely actions of central banks in the setting of short-term interest rates and consequent effects on the yields and prices of fixed interest securities. As at February 2018, although inflation is currently low, we consider that in the medium-term there is a risk that inflation, interest rates and bond yields may rise, resulting in a decrease in the market value of certain of our fixed interest investments. See Risk Factors - Our results of operations and investment portfolio may be materially affected by conditions impacting the level of interest rates in the global capital markets and major economies, such as central bank policies in interest rates and the rate of inflation.\u201d\nReconciliation of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted diluted book value per ordinary share, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, is calculated by deducting from total shareholders' equity the total of: accumulated other comprehensive income; the value of preference shares less issue expenses; the share of equity due to non-controlling interests; and adding back ordinary dividends. The resulting balance is then divided by the diluted number of ordinary shares as at the year end. We believe that adding back ordinary dividends provides a more consistent and useful measurement of total shareholder value, which supplements U.S. GAAP information. We have excluded accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments is primarily the result of interest rate movements and the resultant impact on fixed income securities, and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign exchange is the result of exchange rate movements between the U.S. Dollar and the functional currencies of our Operating Subsidiaries. Therefore, we believe that excluding these unrealized appreciations (depreciations) provides a more consistent and useful measurement of operating performance, which supplements U.S. GAAP information.\n\nAverage equity, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, is used in calculating ordinary shareholders return on average equity. Average equity is calculated by taking the arithmetic average of total shareholders' equity on a monthly basis for the stated periods excluding (i) the average share of equity due to non-controlling interests and (ii) the average value of preference shares less issue expenses.\n\nOperating income, a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, is an internal performance measure used by us in the management of our operations and represents after-tax operational results excluding, as applicable, after-tax net realized and unrealized gains or losses, including net realized and unrealized gains and losses on interest rate swaps, after-tax net foreign exchange gains or losses, including net realized and unrealized gains and losses from foreign exchange contracts, net realized gains or losses on investments, amortization of intangible assets and certain non-recurring income or expenses. We exclude after-tax net realized and unrealized capital gains or losses, after-tax net foreign exchange gains or losses and changes in the fair value of derivatives from our calculation of operating income because the amount of these gains or losses is heavily influenced by, and fluctuates in part, according to the availability of market opportunities. We believe these amounts are largely independent of our business and underwriting process and including them distorts the analysis of trends in its operations. In addition to presenting net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe that showing operating income enables investors, analysts, rating agencies and other users of our financial information to more easily analyze our results of operations in a manner similar to how management analyzes our underlying business performance. Operating income should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income.\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The company operates in the insurance and reinsurance industry, where it faced challenges including costly catastrophe events and losses, leading to significant underwriting losses in its insurance segment, as well as increased incidence of large losses and attritional losses. The company launched an Effectiveness and Efficiency Program aimed at improving operations and market position, anticipating savings of $160 million over the following three years with substantial ongoing annual savings thereafter, despite expected charges and investment for execution of the program.\n\nThe reinsurance segment suffered from natural catastrophe losses in the U.S., leading to underwriting losses. The insurance segment grew by 4.5% in premiums due to financial and professional lines insurance; however, it posted a combined ratio showing losses. The sale of the company\u2019s U.S. crop insurance business, AG Logic Holdings, was completed, changing its market operations and capital management strategies.\n\nAspen's capital management strategy included share repurchases, increased dividends, redemption of preference shares, and an investment strategy focused on capital preservation and liquidity, leading to a well-diversified portfolio of fixed income securities.\n\nFinancially, gross written premiums rose, but the combined ratio worsened due to increased pre-tax catastrophe losses. Favorable developments in prior year loss reserves declined, and the annualized net return on average equity showed an 11.1% loss.\n\nThere were significant reinsurance purchases and reinsurance premium increases because of the catastrophe and large losses. The report includes detailed financial tables providing quantitative insights into premiums, underwriting income, reserves, and capital structure.\n\nCash flow from operations was negative due to increased claims and reinsurance costs, but investing activities and equipment purchases generated cash inflows. Shareholders\u2019 equity decreased notably, mainly due to large-scale redemptions of preference shares and ordinary share repurchases totaling $30.0 million. The company's capital and liquidity positions are still considered sufficient to meet ongoing operational requirements thanks to dividends and credit facilities.\n\nLastly, the report identifies key non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted diluted book value per ordinary share and operating income, which exclude certain gains, losses, and non-operating items to provide a clearer picture of the company's operating performance and shareholder value."}
